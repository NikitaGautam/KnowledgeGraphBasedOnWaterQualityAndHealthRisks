Prospectiveepidemiological ~tudieson ~ possible health effects from sea bathing were canied out at
seven popular New Zealandbathing beachesover the 1995 summer.The associationof gastrointestinaV
respiratcxysymptomsor other infections witIi'human or animal faecal contaminationof the beachwater
was examined.Beachuserswere interviewed at the beachand then followed up within 5 daysto asceJ:tain
any illness symptoms. On each of the 107 interview days multiple samplesof the beach water were
examinedfor three faecal indicators (faecal colifonns, E. coli, enrerococci).Of the usableresponses,2307
usersdid not enter ~ water; 1577did. Log-linear modelling showedthat enterococciwas most strongly
and consistently associatedwith illness risk for the exposedgroups, particularly for respiratory illness
among paddlersand long-duratioo swimmers.Crude risk differencesfor thesetwo groups were 7 and 33
per 1<XX>
individuals, rising to 62 and 87 per 1<XX>
individuals for the highest enterococciquartile. No
substantialdifferencesin illness risks were found~tween the humanand animal wasteimpactedbeaches,

Introduction
New Zealand'scoastalwatersarehighly valued asrecreationalresourcesand arewidely utilised
for a range of activities including bathing, sailing, boating, various forms of surfmg, and
underwaterdiving. The maintenanceand protection of recreationalwater quality is integral to
the continued use of coastalwaters for thesepurposesand is thereforea major environmental
health and resourcemanagementissue affecting m~y New Zealanders.
For severaldecadesmanagementof such waters has relied upon the use of microbiological
indicators for assessmentof suitability of waters for bathing in terms of public health risk.
Explicit indicator limits were containedin previous statutes,but their applicationto a particular
water body was optional. Currentlegislation (the ResourceManagementAct 1991) still CQntains
optional standardsbut does not prescribe compliancein explicit numerical terms, or restrict
control to microbiological contaminantS.Rather, the standardis presentedin narrative terms:

'The water shall not be renderedunsuitablefor bathing by the presenceof contaminants'.To
give effect to this requirement,information is needed to translateit into explicit measurable
terms.
Previouslegislation specifiedoptional recreationalwater quality standardsin terms of faecal
coliforms (requiring that the median of not less than five samplesin no more than 30 days be
less than 200 faecal coliforms per lOOmL). The suitability of faecal coliforms as a health risk
indicator for coastalbeacheshas beenbrought into questionby Cabelli et aL (1982) and Cabelli
(1983, 1989) whose studies indicated that enterococci were a much better indicator of
gastrointestinalillness risk than faecal coliforms at the USA coastal beachesstudied. These
findings subsequentlyled to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
promulgating new 'criteria' for coastal waters (USEPA 1986) which use enterococci as the
health effects indicator.
In light of this the New ZealandDepartmentof Health publishedprovisional guidelines for
the microbiological quality of recreationalwaters(Departmentof Health 1992),which arebased
on the USEPA criteria. They are 'provisional' for two reasons.First, while the data from the
USA studieswere consideredto be the most comprehensiveavailable at the time, a number of
other epidemiologicalstudieswere underway,particularly in the UK. It was thereforepossible
that the results of thesestudiesmight provide further insights into developmentof appropriate
criteria for New Zealand.Second,and most importantly, it was recognisedthat the findings of
overseasresearchmay not apply equally to the New Zealand situation. Three reasonswere
advancedfor this:
(i)

New Zealand's recreational waters are more frequently impacted by catchment-derived
wastes(e.g. rural runoff) rather than municipal discharges,so one may expect a higher
proportion of animal faecal material to b\ present(there are about 11 million cattle and
dairy cows in New Zealand,each of which contributesa wasteoutput equivalentto seven
humans,aswell asup to 50 million sheep- in contrastthe humanpopulation is about 3.5

million).
(ii) Most of the beachesstudied overseaswere impactedby large municipal wastedischarges
resulting from treatment processesnot common here (e.g. activated sludge) and using
chlorination (seldom used for coastaldischargesin New Zealand).In contrast, oxidation
pond treatmentsystemsare more commonly usedin New Zealand.In 1987,for example,
62% of the communities with population greater than 1<XX>
were serviced by oxidation
ponds (Fitzmaurice 1987).
(ill) New Zealand diseaseand immunity ratesmay be different from USA and other countries
whereepidemiologicalstudieshave beenundertaken;indeedstudiesreport a wide rangeof
illness rates betweennations.
For thesereasonstl1erewas interest in conductinga local study.
Feasibility of a New Zealand study
Before recommendinga New Zealandstudy,overseasfindings were reviewed.The main points
emergingfrom that analysis were as follows.
(i)

Most data show that there is a swimming-associatedpollution-related illness risk, though
results are equivocal for the two studiesthat have included findings for beachesimpacted
by animal faecal material. In the Hong Kong study (Cheung et aL 1988, Holmes 1989)

statistically significantly different from zero). In the Connecticut freshwater study
(Calderon et aL 1991) a finding of no association of gastrointestinal illness ,risk with
densities of faecal indicator bacteria has been disputed (McBride 1993).
Some foMl of swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness is well correlated to faecal
concentration (e.g. Kay et aL 1994, who reported adverse heald1 effects when faÂ«al
streptococci exceeded 32 per lOOmL); others are more equivocal (e.g. Corbett et al. 1993
found that increasing bacterial counts were associated with respiratory and odler
symptoms, but not with gastrointestinal symptoms).
The reported slope of the relationship between 'gastrointestinal' illness or 'highly credible'
gastrointestinal illness (OI/HCOI) and indicator concentration can vary widely - high in
Israel and USA studies (Cabelli 1983, Fattal et al. 1986); low in Hong Kong and Egypt
studies (EI-Shark:awi and Hassan 1982, Cabelli 1983, Holmes 1989). Enterococci (or faecal
streptococci, of which enterococci is a major subgroup) is usually the best indicator of OJ
illness.
Eye, ear, skin and wound infections can be related to swimmer density. Some studies (e.g.
Seyfried et a1. 1985b, Calderon et aL 1991) also suggest that swimming-associated OJ can
be attributed to swimmer density rather than faecaJ indicator concentration, though the
reason is not clear.
Comparison of results of studies is made difficult by the range in sample sizes used, and
different periods of follow-up: e.g. the Israel sbJdy (Fattal et aL 1986), and the Ontario
study (Seyfried et aL 1985a, b) used 3-4 days; others have used longer (Fleisher etal.
1996) .
Indicator concentration at a beach can vary substantially from year to year, so one always
runs the risk of not getting a sufficiently wide range of indicator densities during a
study.
\

In the light of thesesix points it was decidedthat a New Zealandstudy was both feasible and
desirable, with die aim of detennining the most Ajijii:\JPiiatemicrobial indicators and their
concentrationsfor assessment
of healthrisk associatedwith marine reaeational water useunder
New Zealandconditions.The objective was to determineany associationbetweenbeachusers'
illness rates and the degreeof faecal contaminationof the beach water from ei~ human or
animal sources. The study was carried out in the 1994/95 summer, after completion of
preliminalY sbldies in the two previous summers. Appropriate ethical approvals wete
obtained.

Study design
A modified prospective'Cabelli protocol' study designwas used(WHO 1986),in which groups
of bathers and non-batherswere interviewed at each beach, using a standardquestionnaire.
Samplesof the beachwater were taken on the sameday and analysedfor indicator organisms.
Three to five days after the initial beach interview the participants were contactedagain and
askedwhat illness they may have experiencedand when the symptomsbegan.A swimmingassociatedillness risk was determined by comparison of illness risks between the exposed
(swimming and paddling) and non-exposedgroups.

normal activities, or sought medical advice, or hospitalised);(4) nauseawith fever; (5)

'Any Gastrointcstinalll1Dess'(ANYGI) was defined as either HCGI or POSSGI.
'Other Significant People-RelatedIllncss' (OSPRI) was included becausebad1erdensity
may be related to illness, and so was defined as anyone or more of: (1) ear infection; (2)
eye infection; (3) sore throat; (4) skin rash.
'Respiratory 1l1Dess'(RESPI) was defined following the Cabelli protocol. It was not
restrictedto only thosesymptomsaccompaniedby fever (as it was the UK studies,Fleisher
et al. 1996)becauseof d1epossibility of the above-notedfailure of self-diagnosisof fever,
and also becausesome respiratory illness is not accompaniedby fever (for example
responseto allergenic materiaI resulting from micrObial and fungal elements, asthma).
Accmdingly RESPI was definedas anyone or ~
of: (1) dry cough; (2) cough with spit;
(3) shortnessof breath; (4) chest pain with fever.

Questionnaires
Information was required from participants at two stagesof the study: at the beach when
participantswere recruited and severaldays later when participantswere queried about health
effects.Structuredquestionnaireswere used.The French stlKlies(Foulon et aL 1983) indicated
a generally poor responseto postal questionnairesand therefore emphasis was placed on
obtaining follow-up information by structuredtelephoneinterview.
The first questionnairewas designedto: (I) record basicfield data;(2) ascertaineligibility for
d1esurvey; (3) obtain basic demographicinformation; (4) completea check-list of foods eaten
in the past three days that could causesymptomssimiIar to those likely from the effects of
bacterially or virally contaminatedseawater; (5) obtain sufficient details to enabletelephoneor
postal follow-up. Questionnaireswere rebJrnedto the central office at the end of each day and
somefield checking was done at this point.
Follow-up infonnation was obtainedby telephoneor postal questionnairesdesignedto: (I)
distinguish beach swimmers and paddlersfrom non-swimmersand establishcharacteristicsof
swimming, including whether the head was ever under water; (2) completea check-list of any
relevant symptomsexperiencedsince the time at the beach.including the timing, duration and

(pets were excluded from this question. in the expectationthat most individuals would have

Surveys
Survey supervisorsfor each beach were trained (by the first three authors) in interview and
water samplingtechniques,for which they also w~ given a manual.Subsequently,threeto five
interviewers were recruited and trained by each supervisor.Further on-site ttaining by the
authors ensuredminimal study design biases.
Surveys were scheduledfor ~h beach during d1eperiod from early January 1995 to 28
February 1995,which is when bathing numbersare generallyhighest.Although it was accepted
that bathing occurs outside of this period, bather numbersare not consistentlyhigh enoughto
warrant the additional cost and resourcesrequired to run the survey at thesetimes.
The survey schedulewas designedto maximise d1enumber of survey days and number of
interviews completedon each day. This generally entailedsampling each weekendthroughout
the study period, on public holidays, and on selectedweekdaysduring the January 'school
holiday period'. The expectationfor the numberof useableresponseswas around()(XX);i.e. 18
days at sevenbeachesfor 100 subjectsper day, from whom 50% of final questionnaireresults
would be usable,that is, the subjectswould not have visited anotherbeacheither 3 days prior
to the initial interview, nor in the period before the follow-up interview. alildren under 5 years
of age were excluded from the survey population as inclusion was consideredunlikely to
provide any more useful information due to the difficulties envisagedin obtaining accuratedata

Subsudacewater samples(about 10cm below the waterswf~) were collectedtwice per day
(at 1100 and 1500 hours) from adult chest depth water (approximately 1.0m) and knee-depth
water (approximately 0.3 m) generally at three locations, spacedevenly along each beach.
Samplesfor each depth and time were pooled for analysis.Sampling was performed on days

Microbiological analyses
Indicators were measuredusing membrane {"tItration techniques generally in accord with
standardmethods(APHA 1989),as documentedin a manualpreparedfor thesestudies(Lewis
and DonnisOn1994).The media usedwere: mTEC (for E. coli), mR: (for f~
colifonns) and
mE, EIA (for enterococci). These represent the best balance of selective capability with
practicality. Bacteria from within the indicator groupsbut not directly of faecal origin will also
grow on the media selectedand therefore be included in analysis. Our inclusion of stepsto
verify die identity of specific indicator bacteriaallowed assessment
of the extent of the presence
of theseorganisms.Laboratory staff were given specific training and an instroction manual.
Preliminary surveys had also included F-specitic RNA bacteriophage(FRNA phage) and
Staphylococcusau~us. The former have an advantagein better resembling some of die
important humanpathogens(e.g. Norwalk md Norwalk-like viruses) in terms of both physical
strocture and environmental persistence(IAWPRC 1991). However, they were not detected
frequently. Staphylococcusaureuswas discontinuedbecanseof the poor specificity of available

only used in modelling if a progressive increase in risk through the quartiles was found
Statistically significant (at a 5% significancelevel) relative risks were also re-expressedas risk

There were 107 beach-interview days, for each of which four samples (two times at two depths)
wece analysed for three indicators; 1284 total data (33 were reported as 'missing', two were
reported as 'greater than' a limit (>300 E. coli and >200 enterococci per lOOmL at
Paraparaumu on 15 January 1995); d1esedata have been replaced by dJat limit in all analyses
reported herein. A further 123 data were reported as < I per lOOmL; ~
have all been
replaced by O.S per lOOmL. Some 51 data were reported as zeros.
All water sample data are summarised in boxplot fonn on Fig. 2, plotted on a logarithmic axis
to minimise the Stroog skew of the data disbibutions (which is typical for aquatic bacteriological
data). The boxplot medians give the most appropriate indication of typical indicator values for
the seven beaches. Indicator concentrations at the putatively impacted beaches tended to be
surprisingly low, most particularly for the Paraparawno Beach (e.g. 8.5 enterococci pec lOOmL)
which had shown rather higher summer medians in p-evious years. NevMbeless, there were
occasional breaches of the single-sample maximum for a designated bathing beach (104
enterococci per lOOmL. Department of Health 1992). Some of these at least (especially at
Rabbit Island) were the after-effects of wet weather. The physical pooling of samples for each
depd1 aDd time may have ~~-OO further breaches of individual samples.
The standard deviation of the logarithms for each beach is typically around 0.6-0.8, similar
to d1c results of CabeIli (1983), and disbibutions are approximately log-DOImal. Indicator
densities in d1e morning samples tended to be higher than those collected in the afternoon (by
40, 50 and 20% for faecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci respectively). This is a likely
consequence of factors such as tidal effects, the afternoon samples having greater exposure to
sunlight Indicator densities from knee-depth water were coosisteody higher: dJaD those from
chest-depth water (by 60, SOand SO%for faecal coliforms, Eo coli and enterococci respectively).
Similar patterns have been observed elsewhere (Jones et al. 1989). These proportional
differences tended to increase with indicator concentration.

were very similar.
Results of modelling relative risk for the three remaining illness risks (HCGI, ANYGI.
~PI)
for all the exposedgroups versusenterococciquartile are shown on Table 5, for both
raw and age-adjustedresults.This showsclear evidenceof a statistically significant association
betweenrespiratoryillness (RESPI) and enterococciconcentration.Similar tablesfor the other
two indicators failed to show any such pattern; faecal colifonns and E. coli tendedto exhibit
anomalouslyhigh risks in the first andthird quartiIes.Table6 displayshow the predictedrelative
risks varied amongdegreesof exposure,showingthat RESPIincreasedthroughthe quartilesfor
all casesexceptfor subjectswho swamfor a short period (where thereis a drop in relative risk
betweenthe secondand third quartiles).The RESPI results are also demonstratedon Figure 3.
The relative risk for RESPI for groups exposed to enterococci quartiles were consistently
significantly elevatedin the upper (fourth) quartile.The relative risk of ANYGI is only elevated
significantly in the third enterococciquartile for thoseat greatestrisk (long-durationswimmers),
although the risk is similar, but not significant. in the fourth quartile.
The statisticallysignificant relative risks for RESPIhavebeenre-expressedasrisk differences
on Table 7, ranging from 42 to 75 casesper 1000 individuals.
Modelling using deciles to identify some fonn of linear relationship between RESPI and
enterococci did not generate consistent results, i.e. illness risk did not uniformly increase
through the deciIes. Similar inconsistency was found when using the actual enterococci
concentrationdata.

study; (2) towardsthe end of the study it was increasinglyfound that an individual approached
at the beachhad already been interviewed on a previous day; (3) poor weatherat Spencerville
meant that this beach was often poorly patronised.
The study designsoughtto minimise the effect of confounding,e.g. interviewer bias (asfound
by Lightfoot 1989). We removed the main alternative source of possible gastrointestinal
infection on or after the interview day by excluding personswho had swum anywherein the 3
days precedingor following the beachencounter.We could not control for food sourcessince
almosteveryonehad eatenfoods that could potentially causesuchillness during thosedays.The
alternative 'controlled cohort' design, in which volunteersare split at random into swimming
and non-swimming cohorts, has some considerableadvantages(see especially Fleisher et aL
1996). It was not favoured for this study becauseit does not representthe nonnal usageof a
beachfor which, ultimately, policy guidelinesare required.
The study analysishas also considereda number of possibleconfounders(age, food intake,
gender,animal contact).The analysishasusedthe poolednon-exposedillness ratesfor all seven
beaches.At six of those beachesthe non-exposedpopulationshad similar ratesof HCGI (and
RESPI). The seventhbeachhad a significantly higher rate. However, this beachhad between
one-quarterand one-tenththe study size of the other beaches- just S3 non-exposedpersonsof
whom threereportedHCGI (six had RESPI).As the non-exposedrate for this beachis far less
reliable thanratesat the other six beachesthis small aberrantresult wasnot consideredsufficient
to discountdle assumptionof a constantbackgroundrate of GI or RESPI usedin the study.This
rate was therefore estimated from the non-exposedpersons at all beaches. (It could be
speculatedthat the causeof the higher 'non-exposed'rates at this beach could be the poorer
weatherexperiencedthere, so that the non-exposedpaddledin normal clothes and were in fact
exposedlike paddlers;this possibility was not coveredby the questionnaire- it may be wise for
future studiesto do so).
The illness risk that may be attributableto swinuning is of primary interestin this study. On
an internationalscale,theserepresentrather low risks (i.e. the crude risk differencesshown on
Table 4), consistentwith relatively uncontaminatedwater. Nevertheless,elevatedillness risks
for thosewho swam for more than half an hour is notable,as is also the respiratoryillness risk

The aetiological agent(s)of the respiratory symptomsrecordedin this study are unknown.
although it is generally recognisedd1ata number of ~al
and viral pathogenswhich cause
respiratory illness (e.g. membersof the enterovirusand adenovirusgroups,and certain species
of the genusKlebsiella) are shedin faecal matter.Infection is generally acquiredby i!l1!alation
of aerosolscontaining theseinfectious particles(Horwitz 1990,Melnick 1990,1)ler and Fields
1990, Grimont et aL 1992), and the potential for transmissionof viral pathogensvia wavegeneratedaerosolshas beendemonstrated(Baylc:.:et aL 1977).While this explanationsupports
the observedcorrelationbetweenrespiratorysymptomsand faecalcontamination,an alternative
explanationthat cannotbe overlookedis that someproportion of the symptomswere due to the
presenceof a respiratory irritant rather than an infectious agent
The results of thesestudies are being used for proposedchangesto the cuaent provisional
guidelines (Departmentof Health 1992). Sampling depths will be changed from adult chest
depth to kneedepth (the resultsbetweenthe two depthswere little different in this study), which
will be welcomedby thosedoing the samplingas safer and more practical. Also, there will be
no separationbetweenanimal-impactedand human-impactedbeaches(the results showedlittle

guidelines is being revised,becauseresults (Fig. 2) show that exceedancesoccur considerably
before die median limit is approached.

no unequivocal associations were found for otbtt indicators. The most significant associations
were for respiratory illness among paddlers and long-duration swimmers (those swimming for
more than 30 miD). To a lesser extent, an association between symptoms of 'any' gastrointestinal
illness and enterococci concentration was detected for the long-duration swimmers.
No evidence has been found to suggest any merit in ~parating beachgoers' illness risks on the
basis of the type of faecal material pesent (i.e. from nIra1 areas versus from oxidation ponds
treating human wastes). Dlness risks at d1econb'Ol beaches (Wenderholm and Rabbit Island) were
significantly lower than at beaches believed to be impacted by oxidation pond effluent (Omanu,
Raglan, ParaparaDmu) and by rural runoff (Obope and Spencerville). There was, however, no
significant difference in illness risks between the two types of impacted beaches.
The ability to detect more significant health effects, and to quantify a dose-response
relationship, was compromised by the (unexpectedly) low levels of indicator 0Iganisms detected
at the impacted beaches surveyed. This has meant that our analysis has been restricted to
quartiles of indicator densities. Any future studies aimed at strengthening these conclusions
would require a greater:range of faecal contaminAtion than occun'ed at the chosen beaches in the
1994/95 studies, as well as a sufficient number of bathers being available at such beaches. This
may not be feasible, particularly as continuing improve~nts in waste beatment and disposal
could.make such conditions unlikely.
These results are not applicable to recreational use of freshwater, particularly because die
relative culturability of enterococci versus otbtt indicators is different for fresh and saline waters
and because of the possible existence of enterococci of non-faecal origin in freshwater. In general.
the most commonly used indicators of faecal pollution are more persistent in freshwaters.
