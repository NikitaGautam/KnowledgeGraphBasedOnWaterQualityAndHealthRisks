and Waterborne Disease Outbreaks
in the United States, 1948–1994

According to the US National Assessment on
the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,1 determining the role of
weather in the incidence of waterborne disease outbreaks is a priority public health research issue for this country. Rainfall and
runoff have been implicated in individual outbreaks in the United Kingdom and the United
States. A waterborne disease outbreak of giardiasis in Montana was related to rainfall,2 as
was the largest reported waterborne disease
outbreak ever documented, which occurred
in Milwaukee, Wis, in 1993. There, an estimated 403 000 cases of intestinal illness and
54 deaths occurred,3 and the outbreak was
preceded by a period of heavy rainfall and
runoff with a subsequent turbidity load that
compromised the efficiency of the drinking
water treatment plant.4,5
Even outbreaks of Escherichia coli, generally considered a foodborne pathogen, have
been linked to rainfall events. In fact, the
largest reported outbreak of E coli O157:H7
occurred at a fairground in the state of New
York in September 1999 and was linked to
contaminated well water. Unusually heavy
rainfall, which was preceded by a drought, coincided with this major outbreak.1 Under conditions of high soil saturation, rapid transport
of microbial organisms can be enhanced.
Part of the rationale for this study, conducted through a US Environmental Protection Agency grant for studying the effects of
global climate change on public health, comes
from projections of more intense rainfall that
may accompany global warming. In the past
century, average daily temperatures in the
conterminous United States increased by approximately 1°F.6 Warmer air can hold more
moisture, and changes in the hydrologic cycle
in the United States have been evidenced by
increases in cloud cover7 and total precipitation.8 Moreover, the type of precipitation has

Objectives. Rainfall and runoff have been implicated in site-specific waterborne disease outbreaks.
Because upward trends in heavy precipitation in the United States are projected to increase with climate
change, this study sought to quantify the relationship between precipitation and disease outbreaks.
Methods. The US Environmental Protection Agency waterborne disease database, totaling 548 reported
outbreaks from 1948 through 1994, and precipitation data of the National Climatic Data Center were
used to analyze the relationship between precipitation and waterborne diseases. Analyses were at the
watershed level, stratified by groundwater and surface water contamination and controlled for effects
due to season and hydrologic region.A Monte Carlo version of the Fisher exact test was used to test for
statistical significance.
Results. Fifty-one percent of waterborne disease outbreaks were preceded by precipitation events
above the 90th percentile (P = .002), and 68% by events above the 80th percentile (P = .001). Outbreaks
due to surface water contamination showed the strongest association with extreme precipitation during the month of the outbreak; a 2-month lag applied to groundwater contamination events.
Conclusions. The statistically significant association found between rainfall and disease in the United
States is important for water managers, public health officials, and risk assessors of future climate
change. (Am J Public Health. 2001;91:1194–1199)
been changing in the United States, with increases in extreme precipitation events (those
with an intensity of more than 2 inches per
day).9,6,10 These rainfall patterns are consistent
with expectations of a more vigorous hydrologic cycle caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming of the earth’s surface.11–13
The purpose of our study was to analyze
the relationship between precipitation and
waterborne diseases, using the complete database of all reported waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States from 1948 to
1994. Rainfall intensity is assumed to be a
key determining factor in the fate and transport of pathogenic microorganisms, but the
relationship has never been analyzed at the
national level.

and 1994 were obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development. Included in this
data set were the etiologic agent, the community and state where the outbreak occurred,
and the month and year of each outbreak.
The outbreak source was designated as either
surface water or groundwater contamination.
The community and state information was
geocoded and expressed as longitude and latitude coordinates marking the affected city or
county.
A waterborne disease outbreak is defined
as an outbreak in which epidemiologic evidence points to a drinking water source from
which 2 or more persons become ill at similar
times. All recreational outbreaks and outbreaks associated with cross-connections or
back-siphonage between sewage and drinking
water in the distribution system, including
chemical outbreaks, were removed from the
database. We excluded these outbreaks to
focus the analysis on source waters and watershed contamination and to exclude acci-

dental fecal releases associated with recreational outbreaks and infrastructure problems
in the distribution system.
The conterminous United States is subdivided into 2105 hydrologic cataloging units
called watersheds, which are geographic areas
representing part or all of a surface drainage
basin, a combination of drainage basins, or a
distinct hydrologic feature. Watersheds act as
the drinking water source for the surrounding
area; thus, we chose watersheds as the geographic units for our investigation. Outbreak
locations, originally designating the affected
city or county, were recoded to correspond to
the centroid of the associated watershed. Data
on US hydrologic units, a hierarchy of geographic subdivisions including watersheds,
were downloaded from the US Geological
Survey.14 Figure 1 includes boundaries for the

largest subdivision in this hierarchy (watersheds are the smallest), which divides the
United States into 18 distinct hydrologic regions, each containing the drainage area of a
major river or the combined drainage areas
of a series of rivers.
Total monthly precipitation readings for the
more than 16 000 weather stations located
across the United States from 1948 through
1994 were downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center.15 The weather station locations were also coded to the watershed level;
each watershed, on the average, contained approximately 7 weather stations. To account for
local variations, we replaced recorded total
monthly precipitation for each weather station
with its corresponding z score, which was
computed on the basis of the distribution of
values recorded for that month from 1948 to

August 2001, Vol 91, No. 8 | American Journal of Public Health

1997. We considered there to be sufficient information to compute z scores only if the corresponding distributions contained at least 20
years of recorded data. The z score thresholds
were chosen to indicate extreme levels of precipitation. For example, z scores greater than
0.84, 1.28, and 1.65 correspond, respectively,
to total monthly precipitation in the highest
20%, 10%, and 5% observed for that station
and month from 1948 to 1994. The maximum z score determined from weather station–specific z scores within a watershed was
used as a measure of extreme precipitation for
that watershed.

nous United States that were reported from
1948 to 1994. Of these outbreaks, 51% were
preceded within a 2-month lag by an extreme
level of precipitation in the highest 10% (or
90th percentile), as indicated in the figure.
Several methods, and an accompanying large
body of literature, are available to test for
spatial clustering of disease events.16 In this
study we were interested in testing whether
the outbreaks cluster around extreme precipitation events, as opposed to solely investigating geographic clustering of outbreaks.
Information in Figure 1 can be represented
with a 2 × 2 contingency table, watershed outbreak status × watershed extreme precipitation
status. Since this information is collapsed over
time, there are a total of 1 187 220 watershed outbreak possibilities (47 years × 12
months × 2105 watersheds). Table 1 displays
extreme precipitation status for only those
watersheds known to have experienced an
outbreak. Enumerating the bottom row would
require determining the extreme precipitation
status within a 2-month lag for the remaining
watershed outbreak possibilities, a computational burden we wished to avoid. The total
number of outbreaks is shown to be 525, not
548, because sufficient precipitation data
were not available for 23 outbreak-associated
watersheds.
Associations between events in contingency tables are usually described with odds
ratios followed by a χ2-based test of independence. Proceeding in this fashion, however, would require a completely enumerated
table. Note that the percentage of coincident
events reported (51%) is simply the (1,1) cell
(outbreak and extreme precipitation) divided

by its marginal total (number of outbreaks).
Since the row and column totals in Table 1
are fixed, the (1,1) cell determines the remaining cells and hence the odds ratio; thus,
the percentage of coincident events and the
odds ratio are equivalent descriptors of association. Also, because the marginal totals are
fixed, the Fisher exact test17 can be used to
assess the significance of the association
based on the percentage of coincident events.
Although the calculation of P values in the
Fisher exact test requires fully enumerated information as well, the rationale behind the
calculation can be approximated with the following Monte Carlo simulation.
The general idea is to repeatedly generate
sets of “outbreaks” in a random fashion, tabulating the percentage of these artificial outbreaks that coincide with extreme levels of
precipitation at each step. Such a process
would produce a distribution of coincident
percentages under the assumption of no association, which can then be compared with the
observed percentage to compute a P value.
The following algorithm describes the process
for a given set of outbreaks overlaid with extreme precipitation events.

1196 | Research Articles | Peer Reviewed | Curriero et al.

1. Generate a set of outbreaks.
a. Randomly select watersheds.
b. Randomly select a month (1–12) and
year (1948–1994) for each watershed.
2. Calculate and store the percentage of
these outbreaks coincident with extreme
levels of precipitation within a given preceding monthly lag.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 one thousand
times.

The expected percentage of outbreaks coincident with extreme levels of precipitation
within a given preceding monthly lag, under
the assumption of no association, can be estimated by averaging the Monte Carlo distribution of percentages in step 2.
For the data shown in Table 1, if the 525
waterborne disease outbreaks are clustered
both spatially and temporally within watersheds experiencing extreme levels of precipitation, then the observed 51% would be
higher than the percentage expected under
the assumption of no association. We were
therefore interested in testing the one-sided
alternative representing a positive association
between outbreaks and extreme precipitation.
P values for such a test can be obtained by
dividing by 1000 the number of percentages
in step 2 that are higher than their respective
observed percentages.

RESULTS
Table 2 cross-tabulates the 548 reported
waterborne disease outbreaks by the 18 hydrologic regions and 4 seasons. The distribution of outbreaks across the seasons (column
totals) shows that the number of outbreaks is
highest during the summer months and lowest during the winter months. The distribution across the hydrologic regions (row totals)
may be due to specific hydrologic features
present in these regions. The distributional
variations across regions and seasons can be
controlled for in the Monte Carlo test by restricting the randomization scheme in step 1
of that algorithm to adhere to the marginal
totals shown in Table 2. Thus, each artificial
set of outbreaks would have identical row
and column totals, as shown in Table 2. The
resulting test would then be one of conditional association between outbreaks and extreme precipitation, controlling for variations
across both regions and seasons.
Of the 548 waterborne disease outbreaks
reported between 1948 and 1994, 133 (approximately 24%) were known to be from surface water contamination, 197 (approximately
36%) were known to be from groundwater
contamination, and 218 (approximately 40%)
had an unknown water contamination source.
The outbreak data also included the etiologic
agents involved in each outbreak. More than

nificant at the .05 level across all of the scenarios we considered for the combined data.
The analysis stratified by water contamination source showed that outbreaks due to surface water contamination were most significant for extreme precipitation during the
month of the outbreak. Outbreaks due to
groundwater contamination, however,
showed highest significance for extreme precipitation 2 months prior to the outbreak.
This might be expected, considering the direct vs complex routes of exposure.

half the outbreaks were determined to be
“acute gastrointestinal illness,” about 13% were
attributed to Giardia, and the remainder were
caused by 35 other specific agents.
We used the Monte Carlo test presented
above to test the significance of the overlaid
information shown in Figure 1 and other associations between waterborne disease outbreaks and extreme precipitation, controlling
for the possible confounding effects due to
hydrologic region and season. Different scenarios were investigated by varying the preceding monthly lag time and level of extreme
precipitation. Separate analyses were performed for outbreaks due to surface water
contamination, outbreaks due to groundwater
contamination, and the combined data, including outbreaks with an unknown water
contamination source. The results, which are
presented in Table 3, include for each scenario the observed percentage of outbreaks
coincident with extreme precipitation events;
an estimated expected percentage of coincident events, assuming no association; and the

P value testing the significance of the observed percentage.
Results for the association depicted in Figure 1 (combined data, monthly lag 0, 1, 2,
and 90th percentile extreme precipitation) indicate that after controlling for variations
across regions and seasons, we would have
expected 43.2% of the outbreaks to be coincident with extreme precipitation if there was
no association between outbreaks and extreme precipitation. The observed percentage
of outbreaks coincident with levels of extreme
precipitation—51.0%—was highly significant
(P = .002). P values of less than .001 in
Table 3 indicate the strongest evidence of an
association; they occurred when the random
selection of watershed outbreaks, for the
1000 iterations performed in step 1 of the
Monte Carlo algorithm, did not produce a
percentage of outbreaks coincident with this
level of extreme precipitation that was higher
than the observed percentage.
The association between outbreaks and extreme precipitation remained statistically sig-

This study represents the first quantitative
analysis of the relationship between extreme
precipitation and waterborne disease outbreaks at the national level and over an extended period. Our findings show a statistically significant association between weather
events and disease. However, we recognize
that multiple factors are involved, which
must occur simultaneously in time and
space. Elements of an outbreak event include (1) a source of contamination (infected
humans, domestic animals, or wildlife); (2)
fate and transport of the contaminant from
source to drinking water supplies; (3) inadequate treatment; and (4) detection and reporting of the outbreak.18 Given the variability of these factors across the United States,
the robustness of our findings demonstrates
the important role of extreme wet-weather
events in microbial fate and transport and as
a contributing factor in US waterborne disease outbreaks.
Incorporating data on other causal components will be important in the development of
better predictive models extending beyond
this study’s limitations. We have partially controlled for source of outbreak by conducting
analyses at the watershed level. Watersheds
might be expected to maintain some consistency in land use patterns; however, these
patterns, inevitably, have changed over the
47 years analyzed. Several state-specific
analyses that could include more detailed
land use and treatment facility information
would, therefore, be of benefit as a follow-up
to this national-level study.
Our study is limited by the temporal resolution of the waterborne disease outbreak

data. These data have been reported in the
same way for approximately 50 years. Improved understanding and better prevention
might be achieved if outbreak data included
start and end dates rather than simply the
month of occurrence.18
Reporting bias is a key component in the
waterborne disease outbreak data. Experts estimate that we may be seeing only a small fraction of the actual outbreaks.19 With such a bias,
many of the cluster detection methods that
focus primarily on geographic clustering of diseases would clearly be inappropriate. The
method we applied, which is focused more on
the clustering of outbreaks around extreme
precipitation, is appropriate under the assumption that outbreak reporting is independent of
surrounding monthly precipitation.
Although the United States is thought to
have high-quality drinking water, the risk of
contamination from leaking septic tanks or

agricultural runoff remains. One pathogen,
Cryptosporidium, a protozoan that completes its
life cycle within the intestine of mammals, is
shed in high numbers of infectious oocysts that
are dispersed in feces. It is highly prevalent in
ruminants and readily transmitted to humans.20 In a cross-sectional analysis of 50 livestock farms sampled within the 100-year
floodplain in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
manure samples from 64% of the farms tested
positive for C parvum.21 Therefore, it is biologically plausible that increases in rainfall and
runoff intensity would result in more contamination of source waters by this parasite.
Our results are also consistent with findings
from other studies. For example, Atherholt et
al. found that concentrations of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the Delaware
River were positively correlated with rainfall.22 In 1998, a drinking water outbreak of
cryptosporidiosis that occurred in Brushy

1198 | Research Articles | Peer Reviewed | Curriero et al.

Creek, Tex, was linked to storms that led to
sewage contamination of wells and creeks.23
Cryptosporidium oocysts are very small (~5
microns) and are difficult to remove from
water; a recent study found that 13% of finished water still contained Cryptosporidium
oocysts,24 indicating some passage of microorganisms from source to treated drinking water.
Municipal water systems, even today, can
be overburdened by extreme rainfall events.
For example, many communities still have
combined sewer systems designed to carry
both storm water and sanitary wastewater to
a sewage treatment plant. During periods of
heavy rainfall or snowmelt, the stormwater
can exceed the capacity of the sewer system
or treatment plant, and these systems are designed to discharge the excess wastewater directly into surface water bodies.25,26 For
northern latitudes and high-elevation regions, the addition of temperature values

could further enhance the analysis by addressing the contribution of snowmelt.
During the heavy rainfall that accompanied
the very strong El Niño of 1997 and 1998, a
survey of a southwest Florida estuary found
higher concentrations of fecal indicator organisms than occurred throughout the rest of the
year,27,28 implicating heavy rainfall as a risk
factor for waterborne or seafood-borne disease. In urban watersheds, more than 60% of
the annual load of all contaminants is transported during storm events.29 In general, turbidity increases during storm events, and
studies have recently shown a correlation between increases in turbidity and illness in
communities.30,31
In summary, there is mounting evidence
that heavy precipitation and runoff events
significantly contribute to the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks. In the future, incorporation of other site-specific parameters,
particularly land use patterns and treatment
facility specifications, may allow for the development of more localized predictive models that can benefit water managers and public health planners. Our findings provide
further insight into the linkage between
weather and human disease that can be applied to risk assessments of future climate
change.
