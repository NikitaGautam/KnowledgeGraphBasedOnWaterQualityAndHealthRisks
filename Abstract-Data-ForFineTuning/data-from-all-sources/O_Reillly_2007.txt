Background. The implementation of treated municipal water systems in the 20th century led to a dramatic
decrease in waterborne disease in the United States. However, communities with deﬁcient water systems still
experience waterborne outbreaks. In August 2004, we investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis on South Bass
Island, Ohio, an island of 900 residents that is visited by 1500,000 persons each year.
Methods. To identify the source of illness, we conducted a case-control study and an environmental investigation.
A case was deﬁned as diarrhea in a person who traveled to the island during the period from May 1 through 30
September 2004 and became ill within 2 weeks after the visit. Healthy travel companions served as matched control
subjects. We also performed an environmental assessment and extensive testing of island water sources.
Results. Among the 1450 persons reporting illness, Campylobacter jejuni, norovirus, Giardia intestinalis, and
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium were identiﬁed in 16, 9, 3, and 1 persons, respectively. We interviewed
100 case patients and 117 matched control subjects. Case patients were more likely to drink water on the island
than control subjects (68% vs. 35%; matched odds ratio, 4.3; 95% conﬁdence interval, 2.2–9.3). Sampling of
ground water wells indicated contamination with multiple fecal microbes, including Escherichia coli, C. jejuni,
Salmonella species, and Giardia species. Irregularities in sewage disposal practices that could have contaminated
the underground aquifer were noted.
Conclusions. The combined epidemiological and environmental investigation indicated that sewage-contam­
inated ground water was the likely source of this large outbreak. Long-term changes to the island’s water supply
and sewage management infrastructure are needed.
The provision of treated drinking water has led to a
dramatic decrease in waterborne disease in many
regions of the world [1]. However, the availability of a
safe drinking water supply and effective sewage disposal
cannot be taken for granted in the United States. Dur-

ing 2001–2002, a total of 31 outbreaks of infection
associated with drinking water were reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; At­
lanta, GA) by 19 states. These outbreaks caused illness
in an estimated 1020 persons, resulting in 51 hospi­
talizations and 7 deaths [2].
In many rural communities, groundwater from wells
may be the only feasible drinking water source [3].
Many rural waterborne disease outbreaks have been
associated with groundwater sources [4–8]. Ensuring
the integrity of rural drinking water supplies from
ground water wells requires, among other things,
proper well construction, maintenance, and manage­
ment and consideration of the underlying hydrogeology
[9, 10]. Certain soil and geologic conditions, such as
karst limestone hydrogeology, signiﬁcantly increase the



vulnerability of ground water resources to contamination.
We describe the investigation of a large waterborne outbreak
of gastroenteritis that occurred on South Bass Island, a resort
island on Lake Erie, Ohio. We characterize the illnesses that
occurred among island visitors and residents, describe the risk
factors for illness, and summarize the environmental ﬁndings.
METHODS
Epidemiologic investigation. On 18 August 2004, the Ohio
Department of Health (ODH; Columbus OH) and the Ottawa
County Health Department (Port Clinton, OH) invited the
CDC to assist with the investigation of an outbreak of gastro­
enteritis associated with travel to South Bass Island, Ohio.
Case-ﬁnding was enhanced by a health alert to local health
departments and hospitals; a posting on the CDC’s Web-based
communications network (Epi-X), CDC posting to epidemi­
ologists in all US states (through an e-mail listserv), Canada,
and Enter-net (international surveillance network); and regular
press releases that encouraged persons to report illness after
visiting South Bass Island via toll-free call-in lines.
All persons who reported illness were interviewed by tele­
phone using a standard questionnaire [11], modiﬁed to include
water exposure. A suspected case was deﬁned as gastrointestinal
illness in a resident of South Bass Island with onset of symptoms
during the period from 30 May through 8 September 2004 or
in a visitor to South Bass Island from 1 May to 30 September
2004, with onset of symptoms from 30 May to 8 September
2004 and within 2 weeks after visiting the island. A conﬁrmed
case patient was deﬁned as a suspect case patient in whom an
enteric pathogen was identiﬁed in the stool specimen.
To develop hypotheses, investigators reviewed case reports
and conducted in-depth interviews by telephone. Contami­
nated water was strongly suspected as the vehicle of illness on
the basis of size of the outbreak, the range of pathogens in­
volved, information gathered on initial interviews with patients,
and the review of recent results from water testing. To test this
hypothesis, a matched case-control study was performed during
the period from 30 August through 7 September 2004.
For the case-control study, a case was deﬁned as diarrhea
(�3 loose stools in a 24-h period) in a person who (1) traveled
to South Bass Island during the period from 1 May to 30
September 2004 for a single visit of 1–7 days’ duration, (2) had
onset of symptoms during the period from 30 May to 8 Sep­
tember 2004, (3) developed symptoms within 2 weeks after
visiting the island, and (4) had no contact with another person
with gastrointestinal illness in the week before the onset of
illness.
A control subject was deﬁned as a person who had accom­
panied a case patient on a visit to South Bass Island during the
period from 1 May to 30 September 2004 for a single visit of
1–7 days duration and did not develop subsequent gastroin­

testinal illness. One to 3 control subjects were enrolled per case
patient.
For the case-control study, we attempted to enroll all visitors
who had laboratory-conﬁrmed illness and had no contact with
another person with gastrointestinal illness. In addition, we
generated a random selection of patients from a list of visitors
to the island reporting illness to enable enrollment of 100 cases
in the case-control study. Control subjects were healthy travel
companions of each speciﬁc case patient with whom they had
traveled to the island. The number of control subjects per case
patient was dependent on how many persons who did not
become ill had traveled to the island with each case.
Case patients and control subjects were interviewed by tele­
phone and asked about drinking water exposures, recreational
water exposure, and consumption speciﬁc food items. Case
patients were also asked about their history of illness.
Environmental investigation. The environmental investi­
gation involved the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
(Columbus and Bowling Green, OH), the ODH, the Ottawa
County Health Department, the Ohio Department of Agricul­
ture (Reynoldsburg, OH), and the National Center for Envi­
ronmental Health at the CDC.
The village of Put-In-Bay on the island was supplied with
chlorinated surface water from Lake Erie (municipal supply).
Businesses in the village used auxiliary ground water wells for
geothermal heating and cooling, ﬂushing toilets, and outdoor
cleaning. All other locations outside the village used water sup­
plied by public (serving �25 people) or private (serving !25
people) ground water wells. The sewage treatment facility dis­
charges into Lake Erie. Many residents and businesses outside
the village use septic tank systems for sewage disposal. All of
these water and waste systems were investigated, and auxiliary
wells were inspected for cross-connections to the municipal
supply.
Pre- and postchlorination ground water and municipal water,
water from Lake Erie, and ice from 190 locations were tested.
Samples were analyzed for total coliforms, Escherichia coli,
Campylobacter species and Salmonella species. Processed en­
richment broths from water sampling analyses were forwarded
to the CDC for pathogen identiﬁcation. Suspect and conﬁrmed
Campylobacter environmental isolates were sent to the CDC
for conﬁrmation and further characterization, such as specia­
tion and molecular subtyping by PFGE [12, 13].
Fifty-liter water samples were also collected by the National
Center for Environmental Health from randomly selected lo­
cations. Water samples were concentrated to ∼200 mL using
ultraﬁltration membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of
∼30,000 daltons [14]. Samples were sent to the National Cam­
pylobacter and Helicobacter Reference Laboratory and the Water
and Environmental Projects Laboratories at the CDC for anal­
ysis. Samples were analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, ClosWaterborne Outbreak of Gastroenteritis • CID 2007:44 (15 February) • 507



tridium perfringens, Campylobacter species, Salmonella species,
norovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coliphages, Cryptospori­
dium species, and Giardia species. Conventional culture meth­
ods, microscopy, and molecular methods, including PCR and
PFGE, were used for detection and subtyping of microorgan­
isms. PCR was performed to assay samples for Salmonella spe­
cies, G. intestinalis, Cryptosporidium species, and adenovirus.
RT-PCR was performed to test samples for enterovirus and
norovirus (GI and GII).
An environmental assessment performed by the ODH in­
cluded an evaluation of the ground water geology of the island,
the quality of the ground water, and land use practices [15].
Laboratory investigation of patients. Stool specimens were
tested for norovirus, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Cam­
pylobacter species, E. coli O157, Giardia species, and Crypto­
sporidium species. Specimens were examined at the ODH public
health laboratory.
Three clinical specimens were tested at the CDC for entero­
toxigenic E. coli and Shiga-toxin producing E. coli by PCR. The
Campylobacter isolates were forwarded to the CDC for speci­
ation conﬁrmation; PFGE subtyping was completed at the
ODH public health laboratory and the CDC. Three clinical
Campylobacter isolates were tested for antimicrobial suscepti­
bility at the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Sys­
tem laboratory. The Etest method (AB Biodisk) was used to
determine the MICs for 8 antimicrobial agents (azithromycin,
chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin,
gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed us­
ing EpiInfo, version 6.04 (CDC), and SAS software, version 9.0
(SAS Institute). ORs, matched ORs (mORs), and 95% CIs were
computed in a bivariate analysis. We used a conditional
(matched) logistic regression model to examine the dose-re­
sponse relationship.
RESULTS
Epidemiologic and clinical information. During the period
from 30 May through 8 September 2004, a total of 1450 res­
idents of or visitors to South Bass Island reported a gastroin­
testinal illness. Twenty one patients (1%) were hospitalized, and
no deaths were reported (table 1). Most case patients had symp­
tom onset during the ﬁrst week of August (ﬁgure 1).
One thousand two hundred seventeen patients (84%) were
Ohio residents; the remainder came from 25 additional US
states, Canada, and England. Sixty-one percent were female.
The median age was 40-years-old. Symptoms reported by pa­
tients included diarrhea (83%), abdominal cramps (80%), nau­
sea (77%), vomiting (50%), fever (45%), and bloody diarrhea
(5%). The median duration of illness was 4 days (range, 1–52
days) (table 1).

infections, and 117 control subjects were enrolled in the casecontrol study. Several water exposures were associated with
illness (table 2). Case patients were more likely than control
subjects to drink tap water on the island (68 [68%] vs. 41
[35%]; mOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.2–9.3). The same proportion of
case patients and control subjects (37%) drank commercially
bottled water on the island. However, case patients were more
likely to drink from a water bottle ﬁlled with tap water on the
island (19 [19%] vs. 7 [6%]; mOR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.6–30.0)
(table 2).
Illness was strongly associated with consuming drinks con­
taining ice on the island (72 [73%] vs. 62 [53%]; mOR, 7.1;
95% CI, 2.2–25.5). Fountain drinks, crushed ice drinks, and
hot drinks prepared from either a well water source or from
the municipal water supply were not signiﬁcantly associated
with illness (table 2).
Using a conditional (matched) logistic regression model, a
signiﬁcant dose-response effect for drinking tap water on the
island was also evident. Consumption of increased amounts of
tap water on the island was associated with increased odds of
becoming ill (table 3). People who drank 16 cups of tap water
on the island were 65 times more likely to become ill than
those who did not drink any water on the island (15 [15%]
vs. 2 [2%]; mOR, 64.7; 95% CI, 5.4–778.0) (table 3).

There was no single location where all the case patients drank
tap water. Water was classiﬁed at each location as either well
water or municipal water, depending on the source. When
stratiﬁed by water source, both well water (34 [46%] vs. 17
[19%]; mOR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.9–17.6) and municipal water (49
[53%] vs. 24 [22%]; mOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.9–25.3) appeared to
be associated with illness.
Contact with lake water, swimming in any pool, and the
speciﬁc food items of interest were not signiﬁcantly associated
with illness.
Environmental investigation. The environmental investi­
gation documented that the municipal water treatment facility
on the island was functioning properly. Cross-connections from
auxiliary wells to the municipal water supply were identiﬁed
and eliminated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
Sixty (76%) of 79 private wells on the island tested positive
for total coliforms, and 24 (30%) of 79 tested positive for E.
coli. Seventeen (100%) of 17 businesses with noncommunity
public wells had water samples that tested positive for total
coliforms, and 12 businesses had samples that tested positive
for E. coli. Campylobacter jejuni was cultured from 1 public
water supply well. Sixteen of these 17 businesses were issued
no-use orders on their wells by the Ohio Environmental Pro­
tection Agency as a consequence of sampling results. The en­
teric viral indicators of fecal contamination, somatic coliphages,
and F-speciﬁc coliphages were detected in well-water samples,
as was the spore-forming bacterial indicator of fecal contam­
ination, C. perfringens. In addition to C. jejuni, several other
human pathogens were detected in well-water samples using
PCR: Salmonella species, Cryptosporidium species (and, specif­
ically, Cryptosporidium hominis), adenovirus, and enterovirus.
A single Giardia intestinalis cyst was observed in 1 well-water
sample but was not conﬁrmed by molecular analysis.
The geology of the island is such that wells receive ground

water from a karst aquifer, consisting of fractured limestone,
sinkholes, and underground caves (ﬁgure 2). This type of aqui­
fer is very vulnerable to contamination. The environmental
assessment demonstrated that contamination of the karst aqui­
fer beneath the island had occurred from multiple land uses
such as onsite septic systems, land application of septage, in­
ﬁltration of land run-off, and, possibly, a direct hydraulic con­
nection with Lake Erie [15].
Laboratory investigation of patients. The ODH laboratory
tested 70 stool specimens for bacterial pathogens, 62 whole
stool specimens for norovirus, and 67 stool specimens for par­
asitic agents. C. jejuni was identiﬁed in stool specimens obtained
from 16 persons experiencing illness, norovirus in 9, G. intes­
tinalis in 3, and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium in
1. Two patients with conﬁrmed C. jejuni infection were house­
hold contacts of other case patients infected with C. jejuni.
The clinical specimens tested for enterotoxigenic E. coli and
Shiga-toxin producing E. coli were all found to be negative.
The clinical isolates sent to the CDC were identiﬁed as C. jejuni.
Five C. jejuni isolates were subtyped by PFGE, and the resulting
PFGE tif images were uploaded to the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (PulseNet)
for comparison. Four isolates were indistinguishable by SmaI
and KpnI PFGE; 1 isolate had a different PFGE pattern. The
PFGE pattern of the C. jejuni strain isolated from a raw wellwater sample differed from those of the clinical isolates.
All 3 C. jejuni clinical isolates were susceptible to the 8 an­
timicrobial agents tested, with the exception of 1 isolate that
showed intermediate resistance to erythromycin.

Ohio, caused by fecal contamination of the ground water aqui­
fer. Outbreaks that affect many people and involve multiple
etiologies are characteristically associated with sewage contam­
ination of water supplies [5–8, 16–18]. The ﬁndings of the
outbreak investigation indicate that contaminated drinking wa­
ter was the source of illness. Drinking tap water on the island
was strongly associated with illness. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant
dose-response effect was observed, with the association between
becoming ill and drinking tap water increasing as the volume
of water consumed increased. Results of the environmental
investigation supported these ﬁndings, because many ground
water wells were found to harbor multiple bacterial indicators
of fecal contamination.
In the epidemiologic investigation, both well water and mu­
nicipal water were found to be associated with illness. However,
the epidemiologic study design limited our ability to differ­
entiate the association of well water versus municipal water
sources; control subjects were travel companions who usually
went to the same places with their matched case patient, thus
essentially matching on water source. Furthermore, there may
have been misclassiﬁcation of the drinking water sources, be­
cause many businesses in the village of Put-In-Bay that had
auxiliary wells were found to have cross-connections to the
municipal supply. These cross-connections represented a pos­
sible source of contamination of the municipal supply. Thus,
the investigation could not convincingly demonstrate whether
the risk was from well water, municipal water, or both. How­
ever, the results of the environmental investigation consistently
showed contamination of the ground water being supplied to
wells on the island. Episodic contamination of the municipal
system cannot be ruled out, particularly in light of the multiple
cross-connections to auxiliary wells.
The epidemiologic investigation suggests multiple ongoing
points of exposure to contaminated water, and the environ­

mental assessment found widespread contamination of the
aquifer, because many wells from various locations on the island
showed evidence of contamination [15, 19]. In addition, an
illegal sewage disposal site on the center of the island was un­
covered during the investigation, where untreated sewage from
residential homes and businesses had for years been dumped
into a sinkhole leading to the ground water aquifer. The sewage
being disposed of at this site was licensed to be land applied
and harrowed into the ground. The Board of Directors of the
Ottawa County Health Department immediately revoked the
hauler’s license when these ﬁndings were presented to them by
the outbreak investigation team. The karst aquifer geology, the
unsuitability of the soil for sewage ﬁltration, illicit sewage dis­
posal, and inﬁltration of water from Lake Erie all may have
contributed to widespread ground water contamination on the
island.
The number of new cases of illness diminished in late August
2004. This appears to be due to several factors. The number
of visitors to the island appeared to have decreased following
coverage of the outbreak in the media, no-use orders were
issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for public
well water supplies [19], and recommendations were made dur­
ing the outbreak, advising residents and visitors to consider
drinking boiled or bottled water instead of tap water.
Since the outbreak, a number of short term solutions have
been implemented, including the use of water hauled from the
municipal treatment plant; installation of continuous disinfec­
tion devices, such as inline chlorination and ultraviolet systems;
the use of bottled or boiled drinking water; extension of some
of the municipal water lines; provision of recommendations
for water testing and treatment of private residential systems;
expansion of the water treatment plant capacity; and posted
signs at the entrances to businesses to notify the public if the
water supply is approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection

Agency. The Ottawa County Health Department and the ODH
have implemented more stringent construction standards for
new wells designed to minimize exposure to contaminants, have
improved enforcement of continuous disinfection requirements
for contaminated wells, and have provided educational infor­
mation to residents with recommendations for frequent bac­
terial testing of private wells. Further large-scale improvements
to the water and waste treatment infrastructure on the island
are being implemented as a consequence of the outbreak.
Water quality degradation on South Bass Island most likely
occurred over a long period of time—possibly years. It would
be prudent, particularly in areas with similar karst hydrogeology
where ground water is a source of drinking water or where
ground water is connected to surface water, to examine the
available historical water-quality data trends to prevent such
waterborne outbreaks of infection from occurring. Swift im­
plementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s pro­
posed Ground Water Rule, which speciﬁes the appropriate use
of disinfection in ground water, addresses other components

of ground water systems, and establishes a targeted strategy to
identify ground water systems at high risk for contamination,
may have an impact on protecting public health [20].
In light of this large outbreak on South Bass Island, devel­
opment of an island-wide community public water system is
recommended to provide safe, sufﬁcient, and sustainable drink­
ing water for residents and visitors, and further investigation
of the inﬂuence of sewage disposal on the underground aquifer
is warranted. The beneﬁts of adequate infrastructure to guar­
antee drinking water safety far outweigh its costs.

Figure 2. Representation of karst hydrogeology on South Bass Island, Ohio. From left to right of the schematic, ground water is replenished by
precipitation that drains into the aquifer. This ground water can supply water to wells. Contaminants from sewage and animal reservoirs may be
ﬂushed through the fractured rock or down sinkholes into the aquifer. The karst aquifer is hydraulically connected to Lake Erie, and thus, surface
water from Lake Erie may inﬁltrate the ground water aquifer via fractures. Soil on the island is very thin and absent in some places, providing little
to no natural ﬁltration of contaminants.
