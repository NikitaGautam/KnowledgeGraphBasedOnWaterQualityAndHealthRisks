Background: Studies of health risks associated with recreational
water exposure require investigators to make choices about water
quality indicator averaging techniques, exposure definitions, followup periods, and model specifications; however, investigators seldom
describe the impact of these choices on reported results. Our objectives are to report illness risk from swimming at a marine beach
affected by nonpoint sources of urban runoff, measure associations
between fecal indicator bacteria levels and subsequent illness among
swimmers, and investigate the sensitivity of results to a range of
exposure and outcome definitions.
Methods: In 2009, we enrolled 5674 people in a prospective cohort
at Malibu Beach, a coastal marine beach in California, and measured
daily health symptoms 10–19 days later. Concurrent water quality samples were analyzed for indicator bacteria using culture and
molecular methods. We compared illness risk between nonswimmers
and swimmers, and among swimmers exposed to various levels of
fecal indicator bacteria.

Results: Diarrhea was more common among swimmers than nonswimmers (adjusted odds ratio = 1.88 [95% confidence interval =
1.09–3.24]) within 3 days of the beach visit. Water quality was generally good (fecal indicator bacteria levels exceeded water quality
guidelines for only 7% of study samples). Fecal indicator bacteria
levels were not consistently associated with swimmer illness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall inference was not substantially affected by the choice of exposure and outcome definitions.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the 3 days following a beach
visit may be the most relevant period for health outcome measurement in recreational water studies. Under the water quality conditions observed in this study, fecal indicator bacteria levels were not
associated with swimmer illness.

ater quality standards for fecal contamination in recreational waters focus on the measurement of fecal
indicator bacteria, such as Enterococcus, which covary with
pathogens in sources of human waste but are easier, cheaper,
and faster to measure than the pathogens themselves.1,2 Studies that estimate the relationship between fecal indicator bacteria levels and subsequent illness among swimmers often rely
on prospective cohort designs. Investigators have used similar
designs at a variety of beaches (freshwater and marine), with
various sources of pollution (well-defined “point sources,”
such as sewage treatment discharges, vs. “nonpoint sources,”
such as urban or agricultural runoff), and using indicator bacteria detected by culture (eg, Enterococcus Method 1600) or
more rapid molecular methods (eg, Enterococcus qPCR).3–10
Cohort studies require investigators to make many decisions about how to define swimming-related exposure and
health outcomes. Studies typically use a small set of exposure
definitions and report a limited set of results. For example,
investigators often assign daily average indicator bacteria levels to all swimmers at the beach on a given day.3–7 Cohort studies also follow participants for incident illness over a period
of at least 10 days. This follow-up period is long enough to
identify a large number of cases and capture relevant pathogen

incubation periods but short enough to avoid excessive problems with errors due to poor recall. Despite the importance of
definition choices, only three previous studies have reported
any alternative estimates, and then only in supporting materials. 6,8,10 To our knowledge, no study of infections to swimmers
has systematically studied the effect of definition choices on
the stability of risk estimates.
Our objectives are (1) to measure the risk of illness
that results from swimming at a marine beach affected by
dry weather runoff and nonpoint source contaminants; (2)
to determine the association between fecal indicator bacteria, measured with culture and molecular methods, and subsequent illness among swimmers; and (3) to investigate the
impact of outcome and exposure measurement choices on the
results. We consider daily illness patterns among nonswimmers and swimmers after visiting the beach to determine the
most sensitive risk periods. We also present a simple stability
analysis11 to assess whether parameter estimates calculated
with the de facto standard methodology are sufficiently robust
to the choices that govern the presentation of primary results.

METHODS
Beach Description
Malibu Surfrider State Beach is one of California’s
premier surfing and swimming beaches. The beach is located
at the mouth of the 282 km2 Malibu Creek watershed. The
majority of its 90,000 residents have sewerage connections to
the Tapia Water Reclamation facility (8 km from the beach),
where wastewater is denitrified, filtered, and chlorine disinfected. Some residents and commercial facilities, particularly
in the lower watershed, use onsite septic and advanced treatment systems. The Tapia facility discharges about 10 million
gallons per day of treated effluent into the watershed November through March. Between April and October, the facility
does not discharge into the watershed unless the California
Department of Fish and Game requests them to discharge
water to preserve flows for steelhead fish; instead, the treated
effluent is recycled and used for irrigation. There were no discharges during the study period. Currently, large reaches of
Malibu Creek and Malibu Surfrider Beach are listed by the
State of California and the United States Environmental Protection Agency as impaired by bacterial contamination.12

Study Design
In a prospective cohort design, we enrolled beach visitors and measured reported daily health outcomes between 10
and 19 days later with a phone interview (median follow-up
time [5th, 95th percentile] = 11 [10, 15] days). Interviewers
approached beach visitors on 39 days between 23 May and
20 September 2009; 30 of these recruitment days were on
weekends. Interviewers enrolled consenting households if
they met these eligibility criteria: (1) at least one household
member at the beach was aged ≥18 years; (2) home address
was in the United States, Canada, or Mexico; (3) no previous
846 | www.epidem.com

study participation in the past 28 days; and (4) ability to speak
English or Spanish. Our target enrollment for the summer was
5,000, based on past studies in California.3,7,8
Interviewers gave participants an incentive (beach ball)
and a short questionnaire to complete, then recorded the closest water sampling site to each participant. The beach questionnaire asked about water exposure and about exposures or
illness experienced in the previous 3 days. During a follow-up
phone call, study staff conducted a 10- to 15-minute interview
with each household to measure daily records of acute health
outcomes, demographic information, swimming activity, and
other exposures since the index beach visit.

Water Quality Sampling and Laboratory
Analysis
Water quality samples were collected at five sites along
the beach; three of the sites were colocated with existing sites
monitored by the Los Angeles County Department of Public
Health and the City of Los Angeles, Environmental Monitoring Division (Figure 1, Sites A, B, E). On each recruitment
day the field team also collected water quality samples at 8:00
(same as Health Department) and at 13:00 (approximate time
of maximum swimmer density). Sampling depth mimicked
public monitoring methods: 0.5 m depth on an incoming wave.
Water quality analyses were identical to those used by
Colford et al.8 All samples for culture and defined-substrate
technology methods were processed immediately; filters
for three qPCR methods were frozen for later analysis. We
analyzed samples for culture-based fecal indicator bacteria:
Enterococcus using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Method 1600,13 fecal coliforms on the m-FC media, and total
coliforms on m-Endo media.14 We measured Escherichia coli
using Colilert® (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME).14 We also measured Enterococcus using Enterolert (IDEXX)14 and three
qPCR methods. TaqMan and Scorpion-1 qPCR methods targeted the same broad species range of the genus Enterococcus but differed in their primer-probe chemistries and in the
final calculation of quantitative results.15,16 The third qPCR
method, Scorpion-2, was identical to Scorpion-1 except that it
included a primer-probe complex that amplified only Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which are common
Enterococcus species found in human fecal contamination.17
We recorded Taqman qPCR results as calibrator cell equivalents per 100 mL for both the Δ-Ct and the Δ-Δ-Ct method;6,15
we recorded Scorpion-1 and Scorpion-2 results in cell equivalents per 100 mL using the Δ-Ct method.16

Swim Exposure Definitions
We measured individual water exposure using selfreported water activity. Consistent with prior studies,4–8 we
created a graded classification scheme based on the person’s
minimum exposure: (1) any water contact, (2) body immersion, (3) head immersion, and (4) swallowed water. We
defined body immersion as water contact above the waist,
head immersion as head below the water line, and swallowed

water as ingestion of any ocean water; those who reported no
contact with ocean water were classified as nonswimmers.
We measured water quality exposure by combining swimmer exposure with indicator bacteria levels. We considered nine
methods for averaging and assigning indicators (­Figure 2).
Consistent with two companion studies at Doheny8 and Avalon
beaches, we used a site-specific daily-average method as our
primary exposure definition (Figure 2, Method 5).

Outcome Definitions
We measured two primary outcomes: (1) diarrhea,
defined as three or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours18;
and (2) gastrointestinal illness, defined as (i) diarrhea, (ii)
vomiting, (iii) nausea and stomach cramps, (iv) nausea and
missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal illness, or (v)
stomach cramps and missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal illness.5,6,8–10 We measured cumulative incident illness
in the 10 days following the beach visit (the period for which
we had complete follow-up for all participants); we excluded
anyone with illness at enrollment.
In addition to our primary outcomes, we measured skin
rash, eye infection, earache, fever, urinary tract infections, and
upper respiratory illness (defined as any two of the following:
sore throat, cough, runny nose, common cold, or fever5,6,8,9).

Descriptive Analysis of Illness
In the primary analysis, we examined incident diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness in the 10 days following the
beach visit. Three recently published studies have suggested

swimmer illness is elevated in the 2–3 days following the
beach visit.8,19,20 We complemented our primary analysis with
a descriptive analysis of time-to-illness onset and daily incidence to identify whether swimmers and nonswimmers had
different illness patterns and, if so, to identify the most relevant period over which to measure swimming exposure risk
and associations between indicator levels and illness. The
descriptive analysis was not prespecified. We defined timeto-illness as the number of days between the beach visit and
the first symptom and compared time-to-illness distributions
among nonswimmers and swimmers. We calculated the differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily incidence
between nonswimmers and the graded water exposure definitions by bootstrapping the dataset (resampling observations
clustered at the household level) and recalculating differences
for each day of follow-up.

Illness Risk Associated with Swimming and
Indicator Bacteria Levels
In swim exposure analyses (comparing swimmers to
nonswimmers), our parameter of interest was the relative
risk associated with exposure to ocean water. The comparison group for these analyses was nonswimmers. In analyzing
the association between indicator bacteria levels and swimmer
illness, our parameter of interest was the relative risk associated with a log10 increase in indicator levels among swimmers with a defined level of water contact (body immersion,
head immersion, swallowed water). We estimated the relative
risk of illness due to swim exposure using the odds ratio (OR)

RESULTS
Study Population
Field interviewers approached 7231 households; 1362
did not meet study eligibility criteria. Of the eligible households, 3469 consented to participate and completed the beach
interview, and 2713 (78%) completed the phone interview.
Participants who completed the interview had similar demographics to those lost to follow-up (Table 1). Of the 5674 participants in the study, 5091 (90%) were recruited on a Friday,
Saturday, or Sunday. Swimmers were more likely to be male
and younger than nonswimmers, but all groups had similar
ethnicity and household income. Of 2559 body immersion
swimmers, we excluded 83 from the analyses that required
site-specific exposure assignment because we had not obtained
swim locations for them.

calculated with logistic regression. The eAppendix (http://
links.lww.com/EDE/A720) includes details of the regression
models used to estimate the parameters of interest.

Stability Analysis for Indicator Bacteria Levels
and Swimmer Illness
We evaluated the stability of our results to the method
of indicator assignment (Figure 2), definition of swim exposure (body immersion, head immersion, swallowed water),
length of follow-up (10 days, 3 days), and model (unadjusted,
adjusted) by repeating the analysis for every combination of
these analytic choices. This resulted in 9 × 3 × 2 × 2 = 108 OR
estimates for each indicator. We used kernel density distribution plots and forest plots to qualitatively assess the sensitivity
of parameter estimates to choice of analysis method.

Enterococcus concentrations measured by EPA
Method 1600 ranged from <1 to 1740 colony forming
units (CFU)/100 mL in the ocean locations (Table 2). Of
the 2559 body immersion swimmers, 99% swam at sites
A, B, D, and E. Enterococcus EPA Method 1600 exceeded
(failed to meet) state water quality objectives in 7% (>35
CFU/100 mL) and 4% (>104 CFU/100 mL) of the samples
at these four sites; 95% of the samples collected from site
C (in the lagoon) exceeded 104 CFU/100 mL (Figure 1).
The exceedence percentages during this study were lower
than historic water quality collected by County and City
agencies from late May to September between 2004 and
2008. Historic exceedence percentages at sites A, B, and
E were 6.2% (A), 9.1% (B), and 9.7% (E) for Enterococcus >104 CFU/100 mL and 12.4% (A), 26.9% (B), and
14.0% (E) for any of the three indicators (total coliforms
>10,000 CFU/100 mL, fecal coliforms >400 CFU/100 mL,
and Enterococcus >104 CFU/100 mL).21,22 Water quality
worsened when the sand berm blocking the lagoon mouth
was open and its contents flowed directly into the ocean
(eFigure 1, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720). At sites A
and B (immediately up- and down-current from the Malibu
Lagoon mouth), all samples that exceeded water quality
standard occurred with an open berm.

Illness Onset During Follow-up
Time to diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness was shorter
for swimmers compared with nonswimmers (eTable 1, eFigure 2, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720). Swimmers had elevated incidence of diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness on
days 1 to 3 following the beach visit. By days 3 to 4, diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness incidence among swimmers
returned to the nonswimmer level (Figure 3). Other symptoms
of gastrointestinal illness (nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting), earache, and skin rash also had shorter time to onset
and higher incidence among swimmers compared with nonswimmers (eFigures 3–4, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720).

Households are considered to be in a swim exposure group if any household member was exposed at that level.

We therefore repeated the analyses using cumulative incident
illness during a 3-day follow-up, expecting to observe stronger associations between water exposure or indicator levels
and illness in the 3-day follow-up compared with the 10-day
follow-up used in the primary analysis.

Illness Risk Associated with Swimming at
Malibu Beach
Swimmers had consistently elevated risk of diarrhea and
gastrointestinal illness over the 10-day follow-up period; when
we restricted the follow-up period to 3 days, associations were
© 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

stronger between swimming exposure and both diarrhea and
gastrointestinal illness (Table 3). Within 3 days of the beach
visit, the adjusted OR for swimmers with body immersion versus nonswimmers was 1.88 (95% CI = 1.09–3.24) for diarrhea
and 1.90 (1.17–3.06) for gastrointestinal illness. The strength
of association between swimming exposure and diarrhea and
gastrointestinal illness declined with longer follow-up periods
(eFigure 5, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720). Swimmers had
elevated risk for illnesses other than diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness, including earache, vomiting, and fever (eTable 2,

use of a restricted 3-day follow-up period did not strengthen
the associations (Table 4). Log10 increases of Enterococcus
measured by qPCR were associated with increased risk of
diarrhea among swimmers who swallowed water (eTable 4,
http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720), but the findings were not
consistent across other culture and qPCR methods. We found
no evidence for effect modification of the association between
indicator bacteria levels and illness by berm status (eTable 5,
http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720).

Stability Analysis
ORs were sensitive to analytic choices (typical OR
range = 0.5–2.0). Point estimates from the primary analysis
were at or near the center of the OR distributions for diarrhea
and gastrointestinal illness (eFigures 6–7, http://links.lww.
com/EDE/A720), with CIs that covered the mass of the OR
distributions estimated in the stability analysis. Forest plots of
the estimated ORs for all analysis combinations showed that
only total coliforms consistently had a positive association
(OR > 1.0) with diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness (eFigures
8–9, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720).

In this prospective cohort study of 5674 beachgoers at an urban runoff and nonpoint source contaminated
marine beach, swimmers were more likely than nonswimmers to develop diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness; illness
risk was greatest in the first 2 to 3 days following the beach
visit (Figure 3). Shortening the follow-up period from 10
days to 3 days increased the strength of association between
swimming exposure to marine water and subsequent illness (Table 3), but did not increase the strength of association between indicators and swimmer illness (Table 4),
under conditions of relatively good water quality (Table 2).
Accounting for the berm status of Malibu Creek as a potential effect modifier did not improve the association between
indicators and swimmer illness (eTable 5, http://links.lww.

EPA 1600 Method exceeded 104 CFU/100 mL on 7 of 39 sampling days. Only 30 swimmers were exposed to Enterococcus
levels >104 CFU/100 mL based on site-specific averages of
EPA 1600 (Figure 2, Method 5); as a point of comparison, 857
swimmers had been exposed to those levels in the 1995 Santa
Monica Bay study.3 Large variation in indicator bacteria levels
would improve the ability to estimate the relationship between
a range of indicator levels and illness. It is more difficult to
estimate indicator-health associations under conditions similar to those in this study, where indicator levels were generally
low. Nevertheless, the indicator levels observed during this
study were likely representative of water quality conditions at
many beaches in California and the United States with nonpoint source contamination.
We asked most swimmers about their illness onset at 10
to 12 days following the beach visit. This long recall period
could lead to reporting errors early in the follow-up period. If
swimmers misplaced illness days closer to the beach visit differentially compared with nonswimmers, measurement error
alone could create the elevated swimmer illness in the 3 days
following the beach visit. However, we do not think differential measurement error led to the observed pattern. First,
if swimmers misplaced illness days to earlier in the followup period, we would expect their incidence to drop below the
level of nonswimmers by day 10; this did not occur (Figure 3).
Second, Dorevitch et al19 also observed elevated swimmer
diarrhea in the 3 days following water contact with repeated
measurements on days 2, 5, and 21; their frequent measurements would reduce the chance for reporting errors. Third, we
observed a similar pattern for multiple measures of gastrointestinal illness as well as skin rash and earache—all symptoms that we would expect a priori to be affected by contact
with marine water—which provides internal consistency for
the observed patterns. Future recreational water studies could
potentially be improved by objective outcome measures, such
as the presence of specific pathogens in stool, serological,
or salivary specimens of ill swimmers. Studies using selfreported measures should include negative control outcomes
to help detect possible reporting bias.23
Recent studies of recreational fresh and marine water
exposure have consistently reported elevated illness among
swimmers compared with nonswimmers following a beach
visit. 4–8 These studies have typically used 10–14 days as a
follow-up period. We found that excess diarrhea, gastrointestinal illness, rash, and earaches among swimmers occurred
in the first 3 days following the beach visit, an observation
documented in three recent studies that examined daily illness patterns.8,19,20 This short incubation period following
water exposure suggests enteric viruses may be the primary
etiologic agents causing swimmer illness, in contrast with
typically longer incubation periods required by protozoan
infections such as Cryptosporidium or Giardia.20,24 Pathogenspecific outcome measures would be required to make conclusive claims about etiology. Because exposure likely differs

across beaches, future studies should measure and report daily
illness patterns following the beach visit to determine whether
the observed pattern occurs in other settings.
The use of longer follow-up periods (10–14 days) could
in some cases underestimate the swimming-associated risk by
averaging over a risk period that is partially irrelevant to the
exposure of interest. Indeed, we observed this dilution effect of
the OR associated with swim exposure as the length of followup period increased (eFigure 5, http://links.lww.com/EDE/
A720). We hypothesized that the use of a shorter follow-up
period might enhance the association between indicator levels
and swimmer illness, but found no support for this hypothesis; indicator levels were not associated with swimmer illness under any swim exposure definition or follow-up period
(Table 4). The associations we observed between Enterococcus measured by qPCR and diarrhea in swimmers who swallowed water (eTable 4, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720) were
broadly consistent with those observed previously,4–8 but due
to multiple comparisons these results must be interpreted with
caution. The lack of association between indicator levels and
swimmer illness despite increased illness incidence among
swimmers in the days following the beach visit has several
possible interpretations: the excess risk is not associated with
swimming (eg, outcome reporting bias, as discussed above);
the excess risk results from other exposures in the water (eg,
swallowing salt water); random errors in assigning exposure
biased the associations toward the null25,26; or the indicator
bacteria used in this analysis are an inadequate characterization of water quality risk at this beach. Bacteriophages were
positively associated with swimmer illness at a beach with
nonpoint sources, despite no association between Enterococcus and illness.7 There may be better-performing indicators of
health risk for beaches with nonpoint source pollution than the
fecal indicator bacteria considered in this study.
Our finding of no association between indicator levels
and swimmer illness is inconsistent with the report by Colford et al,8 who found strong indicator-health associations at
Doheny Beach, CA, when a stream flowed freely into marine
waters; our findings are also inconsistent with beach studies
of point-source treated wastewater discharge.4–6 The present
study was located at the same beach as a study conducted in
1995,3,27 but water quality conditions differed. In 1995, there
was an upstream filtered and disinfected sewage discharge,
poorer beach water quality, and 2998 participants who swam
within 100 meters of the creek. In 2009, swimmers were less
exposed to contaminated water, with no upstream sewage discharges and a restriction that prohibited swimming near the
creek (Figure 1). Most swimmers in this study swam ≥400
meters from the creek, and so the sand berm and stream flow
likely had less impact on swimmer exposure than in the 1995
study3,27 and the Doheny beach study.8 For this reason, conditions may have been more similar to a nonpoint source beach
with more diffuse sources, where indicator bacteria levels
have not been associated with gastrointestinal illness.7,28

We report a large set of analyses that explore the associations among water exposure, indicator bacteria levels, and
swimmer illness. Part of the challenge of interpreting such
large sets of results is that the choice of exposure assignment
and follow-up period is not standardized in the field. Our stability analysis showed that the distributions of OR estimates
can be sensitive to the choice of exposure definition, outcome
measurement, and model specification, but that the scenario
in the prespecified, primary analysis was representative of the
range of results obtained across all scenarios (eFigures 6–9,
http://links.lww.com/EDE/A720). This observation reinforced
our conclusion of no relationship between indicator levels and
swimmer illness in this study; it also suggests that similar studies can prespecify a small set of comparisons to be included in
the primary analysis and obtain representative results.
In summary, we found that swimmers with body immersion, head immersion, or who swallowed water were at higher
risk of contracting diarrhea, gastrointestinal illness, skin rash,
and earache compared with nonswimmers, and that the excess
incidence occurred in the 3 days following the beach visit.
Despite more illness among swimmers, we found no consistent association between fecal indicator bacteria measured
with both culture and molecular methods and swimmer illness,
under conditions of relatively good water quality. Our results
suggest that the use of longer follow-up periods that are traditionally used in these recreational water studies (10–14 days)
could in some cases underestimate the swimming-associated
risk by averaging over a risk period that is partially irrelevant
to the exposure of interest. Our findings were stable across a
wide range of assumptions typically used in the analysis of
similar studies.
