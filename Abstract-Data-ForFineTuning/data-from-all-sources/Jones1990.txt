the same extent. Hence, fairly low indicator concentrations could be associated with high viral infection
attack rates. It is probable that most gastroenteritis
contracted in the nearshore zone is of viral origin.
The bathing-related disease-attack rates identified
by Cabelli at the US beaches are therefore likely to
be higher at any given indicator concentrati\>n
because of the chlorination factor.
(b) IncollSistellcy of Results. Attempted replications
of the CabeJli-style experiments have produccd a
range of different indicators and dose response
relationships in the bather cohort (Tilble I). This
may be related both to respondent and interyiewer
effects, as ic!entified by Lightfoot29, and to the
difficulty of comparing self-selected bather and nonbather groups. The overall failure to replicate the
Cabelli findings casts doubt on this research protocol
and suggests that it is unlikely to provide a firm
policy foundation for UK competent authorities.
Nevertheless: the Cabelli protocol is the best that
overseas workers have been able to achieve, and it
has therefore been approved by the World l-lealth
Organization (Wl-IOl as one of the acceptilblc
protocols in this area 2.33.Thus, it may be prudent
for initial UK investigations to incorporate a rigorous and epidemiologically sound implementation of
the Cabelli-style protocol, whilst at the same timc
seeking to rectify the clear faults in this method and
attempting to devise more scientifically-valid methodologies.
(c) Inappropriate Indicators. Most previous studies
have examined the morceasily-mcasured traditional
bacterial faecal indicators in the nearshore zone.

These indil:ators will not be the main actiologil:al
agents of dise,lse associato:d with bathing. and may
not bc the best indicator organisms for some groups
of pathogens. The usc of indicator organisms is
ba~ed on assumptions relating to the survival of both
tho: indicators and related pat-hogens. Recently,
several authors have que~tioned these assumptions
by suggesting that viral path05ens survive for lI>ng
periods in marine sediments3". ~ and by noting the
lack of expected correlations between E. coli
conce~trations and viral contaminationJ'>. While the
epidemiological significance of these survival estimates and mechani~ms is as yet unknown. the public
perception of ri~k is based on the knowledge of
sewage pathogen presencc. Environmental pressure
groups have, in g.:neral, inferrcd risk from
presencell, and it is lhcrefore important for the
competent authorities to examine pathogen survival
throughout the water/sediment column in ,'\sSOl:iation

investigations.

WATERS

The main scientific p1lrameter~ associated with the
quality requirements for bathing waters in the UK
are traditionally microbiological. being based primarily on faecal indicator bacteria.

STANDARDS FOR RECREATIONAL

IIEALTH IMPACt'S OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL

In~vitably, quality stundards for recreational
waters have bl:en arbitrurily drawn in the absence of
firm epidemiological evidence. Currently a host of
alternative indicator systems and statistical manipulutions are in international use. As Table I indicates,
the available epidemiological evidence from the
cross-sectional investigations has done little to
harmonize ~tandards. Perception studies have failed
either to identify a single indicator species or to
suggest consistent indicator threshold values which
c()uld form the basis for policy decisions on recreationa! water quality standards. As a result a
range of different standard systems are in operation.
with considerable international dispute centred on
thcir health significanceS().
The relative stringency of these various standards
has been exumined by Ellis and Stanfieldsl, Kay50
and Kay. et ai'~2. Comparisons are necessarily
limited by thc different recovery methods used for
th~ enumeratioll of enteric indicator species built
into euch of the standard systems. However. it is
pos~ible to runk the relative stringency of the
standards and dcmonstrate that the EC imperati\'e
or mandatory level (i.e. 95% of samples <2000 E.
cnli/l()() ml) is the least stringent of the main
internutionul standards, whilst the EC guide or

may be more efficient in detecting viruses, including
those in immunization procedure!;, in \vaters receiving sewage effluents. Hence. standards requiring a
