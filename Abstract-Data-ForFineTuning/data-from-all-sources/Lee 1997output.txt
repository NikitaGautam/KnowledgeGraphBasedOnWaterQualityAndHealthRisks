RESULTS
Out of 755 canoeists and rafters, 473 (63%) returned their questionnaire. The crude rates of self reported
symptoms are shown in Table 1. The results of the microbiological testing are shown in Table 2. The
significant results of the logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 3. The levels of E. coli and S.
faecalis were associated with GI-illness but this effect was not independent after controlling for the level of
bacteriophages in the water. No other symptoms, including general symptoms, respiratory tract, skin
problems, ear or eye complaints, were associated with activities on the course or water quality. No
difference in illness rates were seen between males and females, canoeists and rafters. No association with
illness was seen with any food or frequency of particular foods in the week before or after the study day.

DISCUSSION
Our results clearly show a significant rate of gastrointestinal illness after using the slalom course fed by the
River Trent and that the risk is related to bacteriophages and ingestion of water. Our study is the first to
show a relationship between the count of F-specific bacteriophages and the incidence of illness following the
recreational use of fresh water. The other investigations which have studied fresh water (Philipp et al.,
1985; Ferley et al., 1989; Fewtrell et al., 1992) did not study bacteriophages. Two of these investigations
