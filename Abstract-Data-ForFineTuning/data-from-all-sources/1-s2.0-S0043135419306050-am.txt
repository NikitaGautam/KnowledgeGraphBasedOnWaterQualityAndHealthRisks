ABSTRACT

48

Although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an

49

active area of research for decades, beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence

50

of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Beach sand, biofilms, and water all present unique

51

advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction, growth, and persistence. These dynamics are

52

further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and

53

pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach

54

use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats

55

impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling

56

because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human

57

exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens. In addition,

58

population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the

59

potential for human exposure. The cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter

60

microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in

61

quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and process-based models. Here, we review our

62

current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand-water

63

continuum at beaches, how these dynamics can be modeled, and how global change factors (e.g.,

64

climate and land use) should be integrated into more accurate beachscape-based models.

1. GETTING OUR FEET WET: INTRODUCTION

92

Beaches are dynamic interfaces between shore, water and submerged bed, providing diverse

93

microbial habitats that vary widely across space and time. Beaches play an important role in human

94

recreational activities, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and generating billions of dollars

95

in annual revenue (King, 1999). Each year, an estimated 140 million individuals engage in water-

96

related recreational activities in the US (DeFlorio-Barker et al., 2016), providing opportunities for

97

contact with beach microbial communities. Beachgoers expect the sand and water they encounter

98

to be safe at beaches, which is not the case when sewage and other sources of fecal waste

99

contaminate beaches with pathogens (Goodwin et al., 2012; Heaney et al., 2009; Korajkic et al.,

100

2011; McQuaig et al., 2012; Sabino et al., 2011; Soge et al., 2009).

101

Humans exposed to feces-contaminated water and sand at beaches are at increased risk of

102

infections that cause gastroenteritis, dermatitis, and other illnesses (Bonilla et al., 2007; Heaney et

103

al., 2012). Human exposure to pathogens can occur as they interact with water and/or sand

104

contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms from the waste of humans or other animal sources

105

(Fig. 1). Epidemiological studies conducted in the US (USEPA, 2009) estimated the risk of acute

106

gastroenteritis attributed to contact with water when swimming and wading to be 15 per 1,000

107

individuals (DeFlorio-Barker et al., 2018; Wade et al., 2008; Wade et al., 2006; Wade et al., 2010).

108

In the US alone, the annual cost of illnesses related to recreational water exposure is nearly $3

109

billion (DeFlorio-Barker et al., 2018).

110

Worldwide regulation of recreational water quality is largely dependent on quantification of fecal

111

indicator bacteria (FIB), such as fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci (Parliament, 2006;

112

USEPA, 2012; WHO, 2003), but sand is not routinely monitored. Many reviews have noted the

6



July 2, 2019

113

pros and cons of using FIB as surrogates for pathogens in recreational water, including most

114

notably their failure to correlate with pathogens (Boehm et al., 2009; Field and Samadpour, 2007;

115

Harwood et al., 2014; Korajkic et al., 2018). Current understanding of the factors that influence

116

relationships among FIB and pathogens in water is incomplete, and almost entirely lacking in sand.

117

In water, FIB and pathogen levels are influenced by temperature, salinity, precipitation, sunlight

118

location (water, sediment, vegetation), nutrients, microbial community structure, predation,

119

desiccation, competition and contamination sources (Lipp et al., 2001; Medema et al., 1997;

120

Wanjugi and Harwood, 2013; Whitman et al., 2008). The few studies conducted in sand habitats

121

have found that moisture, microbial community structure, temperature (Eichmiller et al., 2014;

122

Feng et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2009), stranded seaweed (wrack; (Quilliam et al., 2014) and

123

associated insects (Swinscoe et al., 2018) affect FIB and pathogen survival.

124

Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to beach sand can increase the risk of

125

gastroenteritis (Heaney et al., 2012; Heaney et al., 2009) by activities that include hand-to-mouth

126

transfer of microbiota (Whitman et al., 2009). Sand may also offer a transmission mode for

127

opportunistic pathogens of non-fecal origin such as dermatophytes, which are shed by beach users

128

(Anderson, 1979; Havlickova et al., 2008; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2016). Sand is a reservoir for

129

hookworm species Ancyclostoma spp and Necator americanus (Yu and Blackburn, 2018) and the

130

parasitic roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis (Boggild et al., 2016). Because of the expense of

131

epidemiology studies and the impracticality of measuring all possible waterborne pathogens,

132

quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) has assumed an increasingly important role in

133

estimating adverse human health outcomes from waterborne and other beach-associated pathogens

134

(Ashbolt et al., 2010; Brandão et al., 2015; Haas et al., 1999; Jang and Liang, 2018; Schoen and

135

Ashbolt, 2010; Shibata and Solo-Gabriele, 2012). Data generated through the QMRA process can

7



July 2, 2019

136

also be used in the development of predictive models. The QMRA framework can help assess the

137

impacts of changing environmental conditions at beaches and may enable more accurate

138

management actions to prevent climate change-driven health impacts (Hofstra, 2011; Schijven et

139

al., 2011; Sterk et al., 2013).

140

The challenges and costs of protecting public health from waterborne pathogens are continually

141

increasing as population growth and urbanization increase pollution of surface waters from sewage

142

and runoff (Liu et al., 2016). Climate change is altering temperature, precipitation, sea level, and

143

storm intensities worldwide (IPCC, 2014; IPCC, 2018), with an estimated cost to utilities in the

144

US of $448 billion to $944 billion (NAWA and AMWA, 2009). Given that these factors

145

significantly influence the fate of waterborne pathogens and FIB, climate-associated impacts on

146

microbial water quality are expected to be profound (Table 1; Burge et al., 2014; Coffey et al.,

147

2018; Dvorak et al., 2018; Patz et al., 2008). The imperfect relationship between FIB and

148

pathogens hampers our ability to estimate human health risk from FIB levels; climate change and

149

associated alteration of microbial habitats may make these relationships even more difficult to

150

characterize. Thus, the existing pressures from human population growth coupled with predictions

151

of further climate change have strong potential to amplify challenges in managing microbial

152

pathogens in the beach sand-water continuum in the 21st century (Islam et al., 2018).

153

To protect human health at beaches, it will be crucial to address these challenges by characterizing

154

and predicting their impacts using modelling frameworks like quantitative microbial risk

155

assessments and hydrodynamic coastal models (Fig. 2 Coffey et al., 2014). Climate change has the

156

potential to influence levels of waterborne pathogens and FIB by increasing pollution inputs, and

157

by altering transport pathways and environmental stressors. Increased concentrations of

158

waterborne pathogens will in turn have direct, negative effects on human health. Climate change
8



July 2, 2019

159

will affect mechanistic models used to predict health risk at beaches directly, with altered ranges

160

for physical-chemical data, and indirectly, by its direct effects on FIB and pathogen levels.

161

Changing relationships between pathogens and the FIB used to predict them will directly affect

162

predictive models of human health effects as a result of recreational water use.

163

This review synthesizes the anticipated impact of climate change and other anthropogenic effects

164

on the ecology and human health implications of FIB and pathogens in the sand-water continuum.

165

We focus on transport pathways from sources to beaches, habitats within the sand-water

166

continuum, movement between sand and water, and persistence within the sand-water continuum.

167

We present conceptual and mathematical models of microbial behavior in sand and use the models

168

to discuss the potential implications of global change for human-pathogen interactions at beaches.

170

2. POLLUTION PATHWAYS: SOURCES OF FECAL
MICROORGANISMS

171

Pathogens and FIB enter beach habitats via both (1) direct fecal deposition from humans and

172

animals at the beach, and (2) flow of surface water, stormwater runoff, or groundwater that has

173

been contaminated elsewhere (Fig. 3; Cahoon et al., 2016; Hellberg and Chu, 2016; Hofstra, 2011;

174

Kelly et al., 2018). Once present, extra-intestinal habitats such as aquatic macrophytes and

175

sediments can also facilitate persistence and growth, which can then reintroduce microorganisms

176

to the water column (Badgley et al., 2011; Beckinghausen et al., 2014; Whitman et al., 2003).

177

Global change factors including altered human, animal and macrophyte populations (Chen et al.,

178

2011), altered hydrology (Verhougstraete et al., 2015), and changing wastewater infrastructure

179

(Abreu et al., 2016; Kessler, 2011; O'Mullan et al., 2017) can influence loading of FIB and

180

pathogens to the sand-water continuum (Barreras et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2015).

169

181

2.1 Direct Inputs & Deposition to Beaches

182

Human fecal contamination can be directly deposited to the beach environment via leaking beach

183

sanitation infrastructure, stormwater and wastewater treatment plant outfalls, especially in the case

184

of combined sewer overflows in extreme rain events or wastewater treatment plant failures,

185

accumulation of solid waste such as diapers, or by bather shedding (Cahoon et al., 2016; Edge et

186

al., 2018; Kessler, 2011). In addition to problems with aging sanitation infrastructure and lack of

187

sanitation infrastructure, climate change is also expected to increase the frequency of wastewater

188

treatment plant failures and combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharge to surface water during

189

extreme rain events (Charlton et al., 2018; Kessler, 2011; Trtanj et al., 2016).

190

Changes in climate, human demographics, or cultural practices leading to increased bather density

191

may increase risk for beach goers (Coffey et al., 2018; Schoen and Ashbolt, 2010), as a number of

192

studies have linked bather shedding of fecal material and skin-associated microorganisms to

193

pathogen levels (Elmir et al., 2007; Graczyk et al., 2010; Plano et al., 2011). Higher air

194

temperatures and more extreme heat events may increase crowds at beaches seeking relief (Moreno

195

et al., 2009; Smith, 1993). Expansion of recreational use at beaches may be particularly prominent

196

near urban centers, due to population density and urban heat islands, leading to increased pathogen

197

loading in beach environments from direct shedding, compared to less urbanized areas (Perkins et

198

al., 2014; Shuval, 2003).

199

Direct fecal contamination of beach water by animals can result in increased levels of FIB and

200

zoonotic pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7 (Garcia et al., 2010). Human health risks from animal

201

fecal contamination can vary, but many animal host species frequently carry human pathogens,

202

such as cattle, poultry, and other birds (Brown et al., 2017; Garcia et al., 2010; Kinzelman et al.,

203

2008; Soller et al., 2010). Some animals, including birds and rodents, can be sources of bacteria
10



July 2, 2019

204

and fungi to sands and may cause skin infections like ringworm (Brandão et al., 2002). Climate

205

change can affect regional bird abundance, as observed in northern Europe, which may lead to

206

bird-associated problems at previously unaffected beaches (Virkkala and Lehikoinen, 2017). For

207

example, gull and Canada goose populations are growing in many urban settings around the world

208

and particularly around the Laurentian Great Lakes (Marzluff, 2001; Shochat et al., 2010).

209

Livestock agriculture, which is a major source of microbial pollutants to water, is rapidly

210

intensifying as human populations grow and demand the benefits of the industrialized world

211

(Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017).

212

2.2 Indirect Inputs to Beaches from Water

213

Fecal contamination of beaches often occurs indirectly via inputs of water contaminated upstream.

214

At almost any beach this can include surface water flow from nearby streams, rivers, or estuaries

215

(Molina et al., 2014; Nevers and Whitman, 2005; Staley and Edge, 2016). Many beaches receive

216

stormwater runoff from urban settings, whether directly via sewer and stormwater outfalls or

217

indirectly through overland flow. This runoff can be contaminated with FIB and pathogens by

218

CSO events, leaking sewage or cross connected stormwater infrastructure, and impervious surface

219

runoff (Marsalek and Rochfort, 2004; Nevers and Whitman, 2005). Defective septic systems and

220

some wastewater infrastructure leaks can also contaminate groundwater that can then flow to the

221

beach environment (Bishop et al., 1998; Foster and Chilton, 2004; Kracht et al., 2007; Rutsch et

222

al., 2008). In fact, microorganisms can be transported in the subsurface for considerable distances

223

under certain conditions (Ahmed et al., 2005; Arnaud et al., 2015); the effects of this contamination

224

source are likely to increase with increasing urbanization and aging infrastructure. Agricultural

225

runoff can also contribute high loads of ruminant fecal contamination and zoonotic pathogens to

226

adjacent water bodies via runoff from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), grazing
11



July 2, 2019

227

fields, or following manure application (Harmel et al., 2010; Islam et al., 2004; Jamieson et al.,

228

2002; Jones et al., 2013; Niu and Phanikumar, 2015; Quilliam et al., 2011; Staley et al., 2013).

229

Predictions of changing precipitation amounts and intensities (IPCC, 2014; IPCC, 2018) are

230

expected to directly alter the transport of pathogens and FIB from upstream sources to coastal

231

waters and beaches (Ackerman and Weisberg, 2003; Curriero et al., 2001; Fowler and Hennessy,

232

1995; Hellberg and Chu, 2016; Hofstra, 2011; Mearns et al., 1995; Mimura, 2013; Patz et al., 2008;

233

Trenberth, 1999). The increased storm intensities predicted for many regions may also result in

234

greater resuspension of FIB from beach sand and sediment into the water column. Subsequent

235

effects on water quality can last up to 5-7 days after the event (Ackerman and Weisberg, 2003;

236

Curriero et al., 2001; Williamson et al., 2017). At the other extreme, increased drought may also

237

alter human exposure to microbial pathogens by decreasing the dilution of pollutants, and by

238

forcing consumption of contaminated water (Boyle et al., 2013; O'Dwyer et al., 2016; RIVM,

239

2010). Drought conditions may also favor persistence of certain pathogens and opportunists,

240

including the fungal group Candida, which can survive in dry sands (Sabino et al., 2011; Shah et

241

al., 2011).

242

The multiple direct and indirect pathways leading to the sand-water continuum complicate efforts

243

to predict the magnitude of change in human health risk posed by anthropogenic change. Extreme

244

storm events, intensification of agriculture, and increased urbanization will all contribute to

245

increased levels of FIB and pathogens transported to beaches. Deterioration of the sanitary quality

246

of beaches, and greater subsequent exposure of humans to waterborne pathogens are very likely

247

without changes in current human and animal waste management practices.

3. HANGOUTS: BIOFILM HABITATS IN SAND

249

Most microbial habitats, including sand, are dominated by biofilms: multispecies communities

250

attached to dry or wet surfaces, or even at the water-air interface (Fig. 4; Almatroudi et al., 2015;

251

Tan et al., 2017). E. coli and enterococci form sand-associated biofilms (Phillips et al., 2011b;

252

Wang et al., 2011), and there is every reason to expect that waterborne pathogens also survive

253

there. Pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa survive otherwise inhospitable

254

environments such as drinking water in biofilms (Mena and Gerba, 2009). Known biofilm

255

inhabitants like E. coli can firmly attach to sand grains via biofilms (Wang et al., 2011; Whitman

256

et al., 2014). One study consistently found pathogen genes eaeA (enteropathogenic E. coli) and

257

pic (Clostridium perfringens) in beach sand (Zhang et al., 2016).

258

Biofilms benefit inhabitants by providing access to nearby nutrients and protection from chemical

259

and biological harmful agents such as antibiotics (Balcazar et al., 2015; Costerton et al., 1987) and

260

protozoa (Matz et al., 2004; Weitere et al., 2005). Surface charges and extracellular polymeric

261

substances (EPS) secreted by bacteria mediate surface attachment and help create

262

microenvironments in which oxygen levels and nutrient gradients contribute to complexity of the

263

community. The close proximity between biofilm members contributes to quorum sensing

264

(microbial talk) and altered gene expression (Jayathilake et al., 2017) as well as the potential for

265

horizontal gene transfer.

266

At fluvial beaches, flow is dominated by seasonal fluctuations rather than tidal impacts, and

267

biofilms are rather unexplored including the complex communities formed by algae,

268

cyanobacteria, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa embedded in a dense EPS matrix were identified

269

(Corcoll et al., 2012). Images of bacterial biofilms assembled on sediments of a beach in Alentejo,

270

Portugal show dense EPS and a close association between phytoplankton and bacteria (Fig. S1;
13



July 2, 2019

271

Jordao, 2016). Besides FIB, Enterobacter cloacae (Mezzatesta et al., 2012), Klebsiella

272

pneumoniae (Percival et al., 2015), Acinetobacter baumanni (Antunes et al., 2014) and Aeromonas

273

spp. (Skwor et al., 2014) have all been described in this kind of matrix. But the full extent to which

274

human pathogens persist in biofilms in beach sand is largely unexplored. This constitutes a

275

significant knowledge gap that hinders the effort to estimate human health risk from contact with

276

sand (Whitman et al., 2014).

277

Biofilm structure and EPS composition are related to both the bacterial species and the surrounding

278

environment. Biofilms can behave as both viscoelastic solids and liquids (Fig. 4; Fabbri et al.,

279

2017; Peterson et al., 2015), allowing them to structurally deform under various shear stresses and

280

recover when the stress is removed. If forces such as wave or tidal action overcome the viscoelastic

281

biofilm, portions will detach and ultimately be released into the water column (Fig. 4; Boehm and

282

Weisberg, 2005; Phillips et al., 2014). One conceptual model for biofilms associated with beach

283

sand proposes that biofilms build up and concentrate FIB and other fecal microorganisms under

284

low energy conditions. The onset of higher-energy conditions, such as a tidal surge or high wave

285

activity, may release the microorganisms from the sand biofilms and into the adjacent surface

286

waters. Microbial settling and accumulation would be prevented at high energy beaches by

287

constant removal or dilution through hydrodynamic mixing and sediment transport (Fig. 5). Feng

288

et al. (2016) demonstrated that the frequency of exceedance of water quality standards based on

289

FIB levels was negatively correlated with long-term mean wave energy at Florida, USA beaches.

290

A body of evidence indicates that beaches with low waves have higher FIB levels than beaches

291

with high energy waves (Abreu et al., 2016; Donahue et al., 2017; Piggot et al., 2012; Yamahara

292

et al., 2007). Wave energy is influenced by beach bottom slope and seasonality (Fig. S2). The

293

seasonal nature of wave energy, which is higher in winter, can promote a greater accumulation of

14



July 2, 2019

294

EPS (a surrogate for biofilm quantity) during September (summer) versus February (winter) (Fig.

295

5 and S2).

296

Given the dynamics between biofilms and wave energy, a conceptual model that describes the FIB

297

release from biofilm in sand, Xfib,sand, (in units of numbers of microbes per time) could resemble

298

the following:

299

Xfib,sand = f (T, M, reps )

(1)

300

Where T is the time since the last energetic event was greater than 1 standard deviation of the mean

301

wave height, M is the magnitude of the event above the mean wave height, and reps is the rate of

302

EPS deposition on sand (in units of mass per time). T will generally vary, e.g. T at a given beach

303

may be smaller during the storm season and larger in dry periods, resulting in seasonal variation

304

in biofilm-associated FIB. The magnitude of the wave heights, M, may also influence Xfib,sand, with

305

greater M leading to more reworking of the sand, more turbulence and more sand shear,

306

minimizing the degree to which biofilms can accumulate. Under controlled experimental

307

conditions within a wave flume, only 60% of enterococci were removed by waves with M values

308

of up to 10 cm, suggesting that very large waves would be necessary to completely eliminate the

309

enterococci reservoir from sand (Phillips et al., 2014). Vogel et al. (2016) suggests that E. coli are

310

also released to surface waters during high intensity wave events.

311

The accumulation of EPS, reps, is influenced by the type of pollution (point vs. nonpoint source),

312

as well as sand grain size and mineralogy. Vogel et al. (2017), Haack et al. (2003), and Skalbeck

313

et al. (2010) observed that coarse sands have lower FIB densities, compared to fine sands. There

314

also appear to be relationships between sand mineralogy and the attachment of EPS, and

315

subsequently, FIB to sand grains, though there is debate over the nature of the relationships. Only

15



July 2, 2019

316

3% of the total sand FIB were released through pore water volume flushing in south Florida sand

317

(Phillips et al., 2011b) as compared to nearly 100% at a California study site (Yamahara et al.,

318

2007). Similarly, Hernandez et al. (2014) observed that calcium carbonate particles retain EPS and

319

FIB more readily in comparison to quartz at a renovated beach. However, other cases have reported

320

that mineralogy may not influence FIB releases from sand, such as is the case reported by Abreu

321

et al. (2016) for beaches in Madeira, Portugal.

322

Given the importance of wave action in microbial resuspension from sand, increasing surface

323

water temperatures (O'Reilly et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2012), wind speeds, wave

324

heights, and storm frequencies in coastal regions may decrease the diversity of microbial

325

communities and thus make the coastal ecosystems more prone to disturbances (Byrnes et al.,

326

2011; Tokinaga and Xie, 2011; Young et al., 2011). Storm intensity and frequency increases may

327

lead to shoreline erosion and the development of flat, low wave energy areas (Wu et al., 2017), as

328

detailed in 4.2 Waves and Tides. These changes, coupled with biofilm dynamics, could alter

329

retention and exchange of FIB between sand and water along the coast, leading to changes in

330

beachgoer risk. Increases to air and water temperature can also alter microbial communities in both

331

the water and sand, expanding ranges of pathogens such as Vibrio spp., Leptospira spp. and

332

Salmonella spp. poleward and into more temperate shoreline systems (Baker-Austin et al., 2013;

333

Sumi et al., 2017; Viau et al., 2011). New experimental data are needed to assess the controlling

334

factors in the retention, growth, and release of microbes from beach sands and sediments, and

335

subsequent impacts to human beach visitors.

336

Biofilms play a vital role in the “hangouts” of FIB and pathogens in sand by shielding whole multi-

337

species communities from external factors and protecting propagules that will withstand erosion

338

associated with high energy waves. The effects of climate change on sand biofilms remain largely

16



July 2, 2019

339

unexplored but may influence FIB and pathogen levels via higher temperature, which may alter

340

microbial community structure, and physical factors such increased wave energy that may come

341

with changes to frequency and intensity of storm events.

342

4. CRUISING: MECHANISMS OF TRANSPORT

343

Within the beach system, various mechanisms mediate microbial movement between surface

344

water, sand, and groundwater. Beyond local resuspension, FIB and pathogens may also be

345

transported through the beach sand matrix and across the sand-water continuum via two general

346

pathways: through-beach or over-beach. Through-beach transport of FIB, including their

347

distribution in the subsurface and potential transport to surface waters via groundwater discharge

348

is governed by infiltration and exfiltration (water flowing into, through and out of the unsaturated

349

and saturated portions of the beach face), interstitial flow, and interactions with sediments,

350

including attachment, detachment and straining (Bradford et al., 2014; Brown and Boehm, 2016;

351

Molnar et al., 2015; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2016). The over-beach transport pathway is mainly

352

associated with erosion of beach sand, which occurs in response to waves, tides, rainfall, and

353

human actions such as beach grooming, and FIB detachment that delivers microorganisms to

354

adjacent surface waters (Vogel et al., 2016).

355

4.1 Physicochemistry

356

The texture and mineral composition of sand and sediment particles affect both groundwater flow

357

and microbial transport because of relationships with pore size, hydraulic conductivity, and

358

aggregate structure. Overall, beach sands are relatively unstructured and less conducive to

359

macropore formation (Abreu et al., 2016), but transport can still be short circuited by preferential

360

flow when varying particle size results in paths of higher hydraulic conductivity through the same

17



July 2, 2019

361

matrix (Wang et al., 2013). Overall, however, in the absence of significant preferential flow, pore-

362

scale mechanisms driven by interaction energies between the charged surfaces of organisms and

363

soil particles become increasingly important, and can dominate in beach systems.

364

4.2 Waves and Tides

365

Waves drive the transport of FIB within the beach environment, by changing bottom shear stress

366

(Chao et al., 2008; Thupaki et al., 2013) and playing a role in the resuspension of sand- and

367

sediment-bound FIB (Gao et al., 2015; Thupaki et al., 2013). Waves lead to infiltration of large

368

quantities of surface water and associated constituents (e.g., FIB and nutrients) across the beach

369

face, particularly in the swash zone (area of wave run-up; Malott et al., 2017; Robinson et al.,

370

2018; Xin et al., 2010). They drive rapid infiltration-exfiltration across the unsaturated and

371

saturated portions of the beach face in the swash zone at a frequency of seconds (Heiss et al.,

372

2015), as well as driving deeper interstitial flow circulations through saturated sand (Longuet-

373

Higgins, 1983; Malott et al., 2016).

374

Tidal fluctuations can also drive large amounts of water flux across the beach face, with potential

375

to transport FIB across the sand-water continuum. Tide-induced surface water infiltration

376

generally dominates in the upper intertidal region and exfiltration dominates towards the low tide

377

mark (Robinson et al., 2007). Gast et al. (2015) observed that microspheres, which were used as

378

surrogates for bacteria, were transported from their initial location (0.05 m below the sand surface,

379

just below the predicted high tide line) vertically to the groundwater table by tide-induced

380

infiltration. Some studies, however, have shown higher concentrations of FIB in supratidal sands,

381

above the high tide mark, compared to sands in the intertidal zone where greater infiltration and

382

vertical transport of FIB into the beach matrix is expected to occur (Abdelzaher et al., 2010; Enns

383

et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2011a; Whiley et al., 2018). In addition, using shotgun sequencing,
18



July 2, 2019

384

Mohiuddin et al. (2017) showed a greater taxonomic diversity in the supratidal sand than in

385

adjacent surface water and Staley and Sadowsky (2016) showed that backshore sands had

386

microbial communities distinct from those in nearshore sands. These findings may be because of

387

lower moisture content in the supratidal sand compared to intertidal sands, which limit the survival

388

of protozoan predators (Whitman et al., 2014), along with various endogenous sources such as bird

389

fecal droppings (Brown and Boehm, 2016).

390

4.3 Precipitation

391

Rainfall events can also facilitate movement of FIB within the beach environment. Direct runoff

392

across the beach surface may lead to over-beach transport of FIB toward the shoreline, and in some

393

cases to the surface water (Silva et al., 2014). For example, Beversdorf et al. (2007) and Heaney

394

et al. (2014) both showed that FIB were washed from the sand to the surface water by rainfall,

395

with increases in observed surface water FIB and decreases in FIB levels in the sand. Alternatively,

396

infiltration of rain through unsaturated sand surfaces may deliver FIB to the subsurface, and to the

397

water table, where they may be transported via through-beach mechanisms (Russell et al., 2012).

398

Silva et al. (2014) suggested that over-beach rather than through-beach transport was the most

399

plausible mechanism during rainfall events at a freshwater beach.

400

In summary, microbial transport in the beach environment may proceed via over- or through-beach

401

routes, and is influenced by matrix composition and type, precipitation, wave and tidal action.

402

Interactions between microorganisms and particles are particularly important in through-beach

403

transport. Waves and tides drive infiltration and exfiltration of water into the beach subsurface,

404

and erosion of sand mediates detachment of microorganisms from particles, allowing transport of

405

microorganisms to surface waters. Precipitation in the form of rainfall or snowmelt can mediate

19



July 2, 2019

406

over-beach transport of microorganisms to surface waters; as such, precipitation-associated

407

impacts of climate change are likely to alter microbial transport dynamics at beaches.

408

5. BUMMERS: ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS

409

The diverse microbial community in beach sand must survive a wide range of biotic and abiotic

410

factors affecting its growth and survival. Significant fluctuations of nutrients, competitors,

411

moisture, and temperature influence the survival and composition of the microbial community,

412

creating a complex spatial and temporal structure (Winfield and Groisman, 2003). Such

413

fluctuations and their effects on the FIB-pathogen-opportunist communities in the sand-water

414

continuum are integral to effective modeling/prediction of FIB fate and transport as well as

415

nearshore water quality. In general, microbial levels measured by culturing are influenced more

416

rapidly and profoundly than those obtained by molecular methods (Korajkic et al., 2018; Korajkic

417

et al., 2019). The public health implications of method-related discrepancies in decay rates of FIB

418

and pathogens in the environment have not been determined (Korajkic et al., 2019). Other

419

substantial knowledge gaps exist, particularly in the context of differences between sand and water

420

environments and impacts of climate change on interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors.

421

5.1 Nutrient Availability and Starvation

422

Nutrient availability in sand can be extremely limited, creating potential starvation conditions for

423

gut microorganisms in extra-intestinal and environmental settings. Conversely, in some cases

424

delivery and accumulation of particulate and dissolved nutrients to pore water via infiltration and

425

exfiltration across the beach-water interface can lead to enriched microbial populations, including

426

the potential increase of pathogenic organisms such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli

427

O157:H7 (Williams et al., 2007). Other nutrient sources, such as beach wrack (stranded

20



July 2, 2019

428

macroalgae; Imamura et al., 2011; Quilliam et al., 2014), attached algae and aquatic vegetation

429

and phytoplankton (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Chun et al., 2015) can also enhance microbial

430

survival and growth (Lim and Flint, 1989). The nutrient content in sand and sediment can also

431

vary between climatic regions, leading to differential survival of FIB in tropical versus subtropical

432

and temperate environments (Coffey et al., 2018).

433

5.2 Biotic Interactions

434

FIB, pathogens, and opportunistic microorganisms in beach sand also face the threat of predation

435

by microfauna, including protozoans and nematodes. While these microscopic organisms have the

436

potential to impact bacterial growth (Alm et al., 2006; Hartz et al., 2008), the composition of

437

potential predators is not well-understood. An important factor in water (Wanjugi and Harwood,

438

2013), predation effects may be less notable in sand. Some studies identified protozoans as

439

contributing significantly to bacterial decline in sand filters (Bomo et al., 2004), but predation has

440

been shown to play a minor role in regulating the population size of E. coli and Enterococcus

441

faecalis in natural sands (Feng et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2009). Similarly, the impacts of protozoa

442

on FIB decay rates were negligible in tropical sediments from Singapore, and protozoa presence

443

was not correlated with FIB presence or concentration (Nshimyimana, 2017).

444

5.3 Desiccation and Solar Radiation

445

Moisture levels across beaches vary in response to changes in precipitation, wave activity, tides,

446

lake levels, hydrology, and meteorological conditions, as such the wetted beach zone can shift

447

hourly. While fecal microbiota are abundant in the wetted foreshore (Whitman and Nevers, 2003;

448

Wright et al., 2011), they are less abundant but still recoverable above the high tide mark

449

(Abdelzaher et al., 2010) and in dry sand of freshwater beaches (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Staley

21



July 2, 2019

450

et al., 2015). Decreased moisture and increased sunlight have deleterious effects on FIB in sands

451

(Caro et al., 1999; Mika et al., 2009) and, more broadly, moisture availability impacts microbial

452

populations and communities by influencing microbial predation, nutrient availability, and

453

viability (Mika et al., 2009). UV radiation is also major factor in E. coli inactivation (Jang et al.,

454

2017; Whitman et al., 2004). Organic matter can mitigate this stress, as humic substances can

455

shield microbes against UV radiation and facilitate moisture retention (Monteith et al., 2007;

456

Weyhenmeyer et al., 2016; Williamson et al., 2017).

457

Excessive moisture in sand habitats can, however, be detrimental to microbial survival, and many

458

bacteria, pathogens, and opportunists in the sand-water continuum require a water activity value

459

within narrow ranges. Shah et al. (2011) found an inverse relationship between moisture content

460

and survival of FIB, yeasts, and nematodes. Eichmiller et al. (2014) found that elevated moisture

461

significantly impacted decay rates of microbial markers and pathogens, with slower decay

462

occurring at 14 versus 28% moisture.

463

5.4 Temperature

464

Effects of temperature on microbial survival and growth, as well as members of autochthonous

465

microbial communities are complex, differing by species and habitat, and whether microorganisms

466

are measured by culture or molecular methods (reviewed in Korajkic et al. 2019). For example,

467

optimal growth of E. coli and enterococci was observed between 23 and 32°C and temperatures

468

>50°C reduced their levels (Beversdorf et al., 2007; Ishii et al., 2007; Mika et al., 2009). Cold

469

temperatures can prolong microbial persistence and some fecal microorganisms survive freezing

470

conditions (Francy et al., 2003; Ishii et al., 2006). Experiments conducted in surface water (Boehm

471

et al., 2018; Bussi et al., 2017; Noble et al., 2004; Sokolova et al., 2012), sand (Staley et al. 2016)

22



July 2, 2019

472

and soil (Ishii et al., 2006) suggest that fecal microbe persistence decreases with increasing

473

temperature.

474

Predicted increases in water surface temperatures associated with climate change (IPCC, 2014;

475

IPCC, 2018) can directly affect growth and survival of microbes in waterways (Liu et al., 2006).

476

The persistence of fecal microbes in the environment may decrease in response to predicted

477

impacts from many climate change, since fecal microbes generally degrade faster when

478

temperature increases (i.e., bacterial die-off processes are enhanced; Boehm et al., 2018; Bussi et

479

al., 2017; Noble et al., 2004; Sokolova et al., 2012). For example, there is a reported negative

480

association between Campylobacter and temperature (Hokajarvi et al., 2013; Viau et al., 2011).

481

Alternatively, rising temperatures may increase the occurrence of some pathogenic microbes. The

482

presence of Salmonella spp. in Hawaiian coastal streams was positively correlated with water

483

temperature (Viau et al., 2011). Likewise, the presence and persistence of Vibrio spp., which are

484

capable of multiplying in water environments, are closely and positively correlated with water

485

temperatures (Baker-Austin et al., 2016; Baker-Austin et al., 2013; Huehn et al., 2014; Sterk et al.,

486

2015).

487

Factors such as temperature, solar inactivation, nutrient availability, and community interactions

488

can have substantial impacts on the survival of FIB, opportunists, and pathogens at the sand-water

489

continuum. However, the effects of these factors are complex, and may not be generalizable across

490

the many pathogens that may be present in sand, these knowledge gaps contribute a great measure

491

of uncertainty to estimates and models of the effects of global change on human health risk from

492

recreational exposure to beach environments.

6. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: MODELING
APPROACHES FOR FIB IN THE SAND-WATER
CONTINUUM

496

Mechanistic models aim to accurately describe complex phenomena by simulating the dynamics

497

of contributing components. Such simulations are useful tools for understanding the relative

498

importance of various fecal sources, fate processes, and transport pathways for FIB and pathogens.

499

Furthermore, they can improve predictions about the sanitary quality of beach systems and their

500

impacts on human health. A conceptual model summarizing FIB sources, fate and transport

501

processes in the beach system described in previous sections is shown in Fig. 3.

502

Existing process-based models of FIB in surface waters use some form of the advection-

503

dispersion-reaction equation (shown below in its unsteady, 3D form):

493
494

+

504

+

+

=

−

(2)

505

where ( , , ) are the unsteady, 3D velocity components in the coordinate directions ( , , )

506

respectively (z denotes the vertical coordinate and t is time), C denotes the FIB concentration,

507

(

508

a first order removal rate constant k is used). Hipsey et al. (2008) provided a general formulation

509

for the net loss term that integrates growth, water temperature, salinity, dissolved organic carbon,

510

base mortality, light-mediated inactivation, pH, dissolved oxygen, settling losses, suspended

511

sediment concentration, and predation and grazing losses. However, a variety of simpler net loss

512

terms have been used successfully in localized marine and freshwater environments (Gao et al.,

513

2015; Safaie et al., 2016). A detailed review of the FIB fate and transport processes in surface

514

water and their mathematical representation is available in Nevers et al. (2011), though more

) are the horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients and S is a general loss term ( =

24

if



July 2, 2019

515

effective incorporation of sand microorganisms and interactions into models is likely to improve

516

model predictive ability.

517

Improved modeling of interactions between FIB and sand/sediment reservoirs may be key to

518

further improving the performance of the current generation of hydrodynamic surface water

519

models. Recent work on modeling FIB transport within sand at marine and freshwater beaches

520

includes considering sediment transport and sediment-bound FIB transport (Brown and Boehm,

521

2016; Feng et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2011; Thupaki et al., 2013) within the beach and in nearshore

522

waters.

523

Different approaches have been used to model interactions between FIB and particles in the past,

524

including: (a) models of attachment–detachment kinetics based on the mobile–immobile

525

framework used in subsurface transport modeling (Brown and Boehm, 2016; Vangenuchten and

526

Wagenet, 1989) and (b) sorption isotherm-based approaches typically used to describe partitioning

527

of chemicals in the environment (Gao et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2015; Thupaki et al., 2013). Models

528

such as those from Gao et al. (2011) use a linear coefficient

529

partitioning of enterococci based on the assumption that attachment–detachment dynamics are

530

“fast” relative to the time scales associated with advection and dispersion. Here

531

mass-specific (e.g., CFU/g) concentration of attached FIB and volume-specific (e.g., CFU/mL)

532

concentration of unattached FIB, respectively. While the use of a partition coefficient may

533

approximate the distribution of FIB empirically in some locations, there is limited evidence that

534

suspended and sorbed FIB are in equilibrium or that a single partition coefficient is generalizable

535

for all environments (Nevers et al., 2011).

536

An alternate approach modeling dynamic FIB–particle interactions is to quantify sediment (and

537

associated FIB) transport as discrete groups based on particle size – for example, relatively “fine”
25

=( ⁄

) for sediment-water

,

denote the



July 2, 2019

538

particle classes with which E. coli are known to readily associate (Brown et al., 2013; Hipsey et

539

al., 2006; Jeng et al., 2005; Krometis et al., 2007) and a “coarse” size class – to simulate changes

540

in bed morphology and the release of FIB from the sand reservoir. Rules for exchange of FIB

541

between the water column and the bed sediment must be defined. For example, to quantify

542

sediment-related enterococci at Hobie Beach in Florida, Feng et al. (2013) modeled “clean” and

543

“contaminated” sand classes and their changes through time. The distribution of the contaminated

544

sand fraction in this approach describes the availability of FIB for resuspension. In contrast, the

545

models described in Gao et al. (2011) and Thupaki et al. (2013) used a single particle size class to

546

successfully improve upon models without sediment contributions.

547

If FIB models considering sediment-bacteria interactions are extended to include multiple size

548

classes (e.g., fine and coarse sediment), model complexity increases significantly, introducing a

549

large number of parameters and assumptions that are difficult to constrain and justify. Therefore,

550

questions of model parsimony, complexity and equifinality (Beven, 2006) should be addressed

551

based on a careful comparison of different approaches.

552

In addition, novel field experiments and data that elucidate fundamental mechanisms of sediment

553

transport with a focus on FIB transport and biofilms are needed. For example the model of biofilm

554

dynamics presented in section 3 and in Vignaga et al. (2013) suggest that biofilm on sediments

555

behaves like an elastic membrane that ruptures catastrophically above a velocity threshold. Current

556

sediment transport formulations (Chao et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2011) assume that grains of sand

557

roll over one another at some critical shear stress and do not consider catastrophic biofilm

558

rupturing. The inclusion of biofilm dynamics in process-based models of FIB in surface waters

559

and at the sediment-water interface may improve model predictions.

26



July 2, 2019

560

Accurate simulation of processes at the sand-water continuum, such as wave run-up on the beach

561

face, cyclical wetting and drying associated with tides and waves, infiltration of water and lateral

562

movement of water and FIB close to the sand-water continuum, all require high spatial resolution

563

(cm to meter scale). Additionally, an understanding of how temporal changes associated with

564

climate change and anthropogenic effects impact these processes is also key to modeling them.

565

However, it is unclear how representative available FIB monitoring data and model approaches

566

are for small-scale processes in beach systems, or conditions predicted by climate change scenarios

567

(Alexander et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2008; Sneed, 2017). For example, the “fast” FIB attachment–

568

detachment kinetics assumption that justifies the use of a linear partition coefficient is based on

569

groundwater studies, as discussed in Bai and Lung (2005). Data from streams and agricultural soils

570

suggest the opposite generalization, i.e. “slow” kinetics relative to advection and dispersion based

571

on evidence that bacteria, once attached, will remain in that state as part of a biofilm (Jamieson et

572

al., 2005). Additional field data from marine and freshwater sites collected under various

573

hydrometeorological conditions will help test and validate new model frameworks for the effective

574

simulation and prediction of nearshore FIB fate and transport at the sand-water continuum.

575

Modeling sediment- and sand-bound FIB transport is a complex, but important step in

576

understanding beach microbial dynamics. Subsurface microbial transport and interactions at the

577

sand-water continuum remain critical knowledge gaps, especially in turbulent and wave-impacted

578

environments. The advection-dispersion-reaction equation serves as the foundation for these

579

models, but relevant parameters, boundary and initial conditions, and model complexity can vary

580

greatly, depending on the focal nearshore environment and localized factors. Existing models are

581

at odds in terms of how to predict dynamics at the sand-water continuum, especially in light of

582

climate change effects. Additional field data validation and model development focused on sand-

27



July 2, 2019

583

and sediment- FIB transport effects on beaches will be crucial to the improvement of nearshore

584

water quality simulations and prediction of future climate change effects.

586

7. EMERGING CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES IN THE
FACE OF PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE

587

As highlighted throughout this review, any advancements in modeling or managing the sand-water

588

continuum with regard to beach water quality must be responsive to the impacts of climate change

589

on microbiological contamination at recreational beaches. As the water and land environments

590

warm and experience changes in storm frequencies, the sand-water continuum will likely

591

experience changes in both the abundance and diversity of FIB and pathogens potentially

592

persisting in these habitats. Such changes may present unique and unprecedented challenges for

593

recreational water quality management.

594

7.1 Increased Storm Frequency

595

Coastal areas are expected to experience increases in the frequency and intensity of storm events

596

as a result of climate change (IPCC, 2014). As these areas begin to experience more frequent and

597

intense storm events, localized flooding, runoff and combined sewer overflow events will also

598

become more frequent, making these sources of contamination to both the beach water and the

599

sand-water continuum more commonplace (Kessler, 2011; Roca et al., 2019; Trtanj et al., 2016;

600

USEPA, 2008). Contaminant releases from wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems and

601

industrial contamination sources will increase by 50–120% in the US Great Lakes region (Patz et

602

al., 2008), while groundwater contamination via the infiltration of microbes through the vadose

603

zone is expected to impact well water quality more frequently (Arnaud et al., 2015; Klove et al.,

604

2014). Additionally, predicted changes in mean sea levels across latitudes suggest that global

605

average coastal water levels 0.26–0.85 m higher than observed in 1986-2005 will impact beaches

585

28



July 2, 2019

606

in tropical and temperate areas by 2100 (IPCC, 2014). Increased water levels, combined with

607

predicted changes to storm frequency and wind patterns, will lead to larger areas along the marine

608

shoreline affected by wave and tidal action and periodic wetting, enhancing the exchange of

609

microbial contamination between the sand and water.

610

7.2 Warming Waters

611

In similar fashion to the range shifts seen in terrestrial and aquatic macrofauna (Kerr et al., 2015;

612

Parmesan and Yohe, 2003; Perry et al., 2005), it may be expected that microorganism community

613

ranges will shift poleward in response to climate change (Burge et al., 2014; Ford, 1996; Lafferty,

614

2009; Trtanj et al., 2016). As global water (Fig. S3) and air temperatures are predicted to warm,

615

the thermotolerance thresholds of some microorganisms may be exceeded, while the warmer

616

conditions may lead to increased decay rates and die-offs for some species (e.g. FIB; Ishii et al.,

617

2006). This may open up niches in temperate coastal areas for more thermotolerant microbes that

618

had previously been found in lower latitudes, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus,

619

and Naegleria fowleri (Baker-Austin et al., 2013; Kemble et al., 2012; Martinez-Urtaza et al.,

620

2010). Additionally, pathogens, opportunists and FIB may be transported poleward directly via

621

hurricanes, cyclones, and tropical storms, known products of ocean surface temperature changes

622

(Wu et al., 2016).

623

Elevated water and air temperatures may also foster the growth of antimicrobial resistant

624

microorganisms (MacFadden et al., 2018). These microorganisms, unlike most FIB, can be directly

625

associated with adverse human health outcomes (Cosgrove and Carmeli, 2003; de Kraker et al.,

626

2011; O'Gara, 2017). Additionally, the expansion of previously undetected microorganisms to

627

temperate regions, combined with possible increases in antimicrobial resistance and the propensity

29



July 2, 2019

628

of microbes to form biofilms within the sand-water continuum suggests that the risks to beachgoers

629

from new and dangerous pathogens will increase in response to climate change.

630

7.3 Drought Impacts

631

While much attention has been devoted to increases in storms as a result of climate change, the

632

effects of drought will also have an impact on recreational water and sand quality, though

633

additional research is required to determine whether the effects are positive or negative. Drought

634

conditions can limit the runoff flowing to beaches from upstream in the watershed, leading to

635

declines in runoff-associated contamination and potentially higher recreational water quality (Vu,

636

2018). Conversely, declines in water levels due to drought will likely expose more of the beach

637

face, potentially leading to changes in biofilm development and microbial community growth

638

within the sand-water continuum. Smaller beach face areas subject to wave- and tide-associated

639

periodic wetting due to water level declines may be expected to facilitate biofilm growth and

640

reduce areas prone to biofilm detachment (Boehm and Weisberg, 2005; Phillips et al., 2014).

641

However, a lack of moisture sources to mediate temperature in the sand may result in enhanced

642

decay of microorganisms (Ishii et al., 2006; Mika et al., 2009). Lower water levels will also yield

643

increased surface area for which beachgoers to contact the sand-water continuum and its associated

644

microbial communities, potentially increasing the risks to beachgoers connected to microbes in the

645

sand-water continuum. Beach management for public health will, thus, require adaptation for

646

increased beach usage associated with greater surface area for beachgoers to utilize as well as

647

changes to biofilm dynamics and resulting risks to beachgoers.

648

8. MANAGEMENT FOR THE FUTURE

649

The predicted effects of climate change necessitate a paradigm shift within recreational beach

650

management and policy development (Coffey et al., 2014). Effective beach management to protect
30



July 2, 2019

651

public health into the future will not only account for contamination in the sand-water continuum

652

but will also take an adaptive approach that can be adjusted in response to the impacts of changing

653

storm frequency, flooding effects, and upstream contamination potential. Beach managers,

654

particularly in temperate regions affected by warming air and water temperatures, will need to

655

monitor both beach sand and recreational water for a greater variety of pathogenic species than

656

they have in the past, to ensure public health.

657

Predicted droughts may also necessitate more effective management of recreational water quality,

658

especially terms of the exchange of water and associated microbes between sand and water

659

environments at the beach. This will require an adaptive and holistic management strategy. An

660

adaptive approach that can be altered in response to climate change impacts will be most effective

661

for management of water resources under rapidly and substantially changing conditions. Likewise,

662

a holistic, “beachscape” approach to management of recreational water systems can effectively

663

account for the entire beach system (Weiskerger and Whitman, 2018). Such an approach will

664

incorporate water, sand, wildlife, human, and upstream contamination/runoff impacts on beach

665

health, rather than simply focusing on recreational water (Kelly et al., 2018), and can lead to

666

management and policy that preserves human, wildlife, and environmental health at beaches.

667

9. CONCLUSIONS

668

•

Beach ecosystems are dynamic mosaics of aquatic, sand, and sediment habitats.

669

•

The sand-water continuum plays an important role in the accumulation, transport, and

670

persistence of microbial contaminants at beach systems, though it is difficult to model and is

671

often overlooked in nearshore research, management, and policy-making efforts.

672
673

•

Local hydrometeorological and infrastructural conditions can influence contamination patterns
at beaches over time and across space, so localized monitoring and modeling efforts are needed
31



July 2, 2019

674

to effectively manage beach systems in the face of contamination in both the nearshore and at

675

the sand-water continuum.

676

•

Beach management policies are lagging behind the research into the role of sand as a

677

contamination source; however, several nations and the WHO have recognized sand as an

678

important reservoir of FIB and route of exposure to pathogens.

679

•

The recognition and ongoing discussion of sand as a contamination source at beaches may

680

signal a paradigm shift toward more holistic, “beachscape” frameworks for guiding beach

681

research and management actions.

682

•

Future efforts to model nearshore human health risks must be robust and adaptable to account

683

for the association/disassociation of human health relevant biofilm- and particle-bound

684

constituents associated with beach sands and underlying sediments, as well as uncertainty

685

associated with changing weather and climatic patterns.

Figure 5: Conceptual model of biofilm development and FIB attachment/release as it relates to wave energy. Images depict model sand

1437

grains with biofilm and FIB (green circles) incorporated into the community.

1438

High energy time (winter): Sand has less time in the
“resting” state due to higher wave energy. Smaller or
compositionally/structurally different biofilm
communities can develop, making FIB
survival/attachment more difficult.

Low energy time (summer): EPS/biofilm can
develop. FIB integrate into the biofilm
community until an increase in energy sloughs
the biofilm and FIB off the sand and resuspends
them into the water column
