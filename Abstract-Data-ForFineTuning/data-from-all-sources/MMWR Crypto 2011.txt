Abstract
Problem/Condition: Cryptosporidiosis is a nationally notifiable gastrointestinal illness caused by chlorine-tolerant
protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium.
Reporting Period: 2006–2008.
System Description: State and two metropolitan health departments voluntarily report cases of cryptosporidiosis
through CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.
Results: During 2006–2008, the number of reported cases of cryptosporidiosis increased dramatically (79.9%), from
6,479 for 2006 to 11,657 for 2007, and then decreased (9.9%) to 10,500 in 2008. All jurisdictions reported cryptosporidiosis cases during the reporting period, and the number of jurisdictions reporting >2.5 cases per 100,000 population
increased from 20 in 2006 to 26 in 2007 and 27 in 2008. A greater number of case reports were received for children
aged 1–9 years and for adults aged 25–39 years than were received for persons in other age groups. The number of cases
reported among males and females was similar. Racial and ethnic comparisons were difficult because many case-reports
did not report race and ethnicity. Peak onset of illness occurred annually during early summer through early fall.
Interpretation: Transmission of cryptosporidiosis occurs throughout the United States, with more frequent diagnosis
or reporting occurring in northern states. An increase in cases reported for 2007 and 2008 is attributable partially to
multiple large recreational water-associated outbreaks. State incidence figures should be compared with caution because
individual state surveillance systems have varying capabilities to detect cases, and reporting might vary. The seasonal
peak in age-specific case reports coincides with the summer recreational water season and likely reflects increased use of
communal swimming venues (e.g., lakes, rivers, swimming pools, and water parks) by young children.
Public Health Action: Local and state health departments can use cryptosporidiosis surveillance data to better understand the epidemiologic characteristics and the disease burden of cryptosporidiosis in the United States, design efforts
to prevent the spread of disease, and establish research priorities.

Introduction
Cryptosporidiosis is a gastrointestinal illness caused by
protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium (1). In otherwise
healthy persons, clinical illness is characterized by watery
diarrhea, which can be accompanied by abdominal cramps,
loss of appetite, low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and weight
loss; however, asymptomatic infection occurs frequently (2).
Cryptosporidium also can cause an opportunistic infection in
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected patients,
who might experience life-threatening infection with profuse,
watery, cholera-like diarrhea. In severely immunocompromised
patients, disease can progress to cholangitis or pancreatitis (3).

However, incidence of this parasitic infection among the HIVinfected population has decreased since the introduction of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infection (4). Nitazoxanide is the only broad-spectrum antiparasitic
drug that has been approved in the United States for treatment
of cryptosporidiosis. Nitazoxanide can be prescribed for children aged >1 year and adults, but it has not proven effective
for immunocompromised persons (5,6).
Cryptosporidium is a genus of protozoan parasites within the
phylum Apicomplexa, and its taxonomy continues to evolve.
Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic disease that causes clinical
disease in both humans and animals; species names are based
primarily on the animal species serving as host (7). Revised
Cryptosporidium taxonomy based on recent advances in molecular laboratory testing methods has clarified that multiple species
infect humans. C. hominis (known previously as C. parvum genotype I) primarily infects humans and exists in a human-to-human

MMWR

transmission cycle. C. parvum (known previously as C. parvum
genotype II) can infect both humans and ruminants, each with
their own transmission cycles that intersect in zoonotic disease.
In addition, molecular studies have demonstrated that humans
are susceptible to infection with multiple subtypes of C. parvum
and C. hominis (7). To a lesser extent, human infections also have
been documented with C. felis, from cats; C. canis, from dogs;
C. meleagridis, from birds; C. suis, from pigs; C. muris, from
rodents; and a C. cervine genotype from various animals (7).
Illnesses caused by infection with the different Cryptosporidium
species might differ clinically (8).
Cryptosporidium infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral
route and results from the ingestion of Cryptosporidium oocysts
through the consumption of fecally contaminated food or
water or through direct person-to-person or animal-to-person
contact. The oocysts are infectious immediately upon being
excreted in feces. The infectious dose is low; feeding studies
have demonstrated that the ingestion of as few as 10–30 oocysts
can cause infection in healthy persons (9,10). Infected persons
have been reported to shed 108–109 oocysts in a single bowel
movement and to excrete infectious oocysts for up to 50 days
after cessation of diarrhea (11,12).
Cryptosporidium can exist in a body of water treated with
chlorine (i.e., it is chlorine tolerant), which poses challenges
for traditional chemical treatment of drinking and recreational
water and for environmental surface cleaning. The organism
also is not easily inactivated by alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
Prevention and control measures include 1) practicing good
hygiene (e.g., washing hands and not swimming when ill
with diarrhea), 2) treating or avoiding contaminated water
(not swallowing pool water, boiling or filtering water, and
installing secondary disinfection systems (e.g., ultraviolet
irradiation or ozone disinfection systems that inactivate
Cryptosporidium) in pools, 3) exercising caution when traveling,
and 4) avoiding fecal exposure during sexual activity (13).
Although cryptosporidiosis cases occur sporadically, outbreaks
have been well documented since the first reported U.S. drinking
water-associated outbreak in 1984 (14) and the first U.S. recreational water-associated outbreak in 1988 (15). Cryptosporidium
has since emerged as the most frequently recognized cause of
recreational water-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis, particularly in treated (disinfected) venues. In addition, foodborne
outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to ill food handlers and
unpasteurized apple cider have been reported (16,17). Outbreaks
resulting from person-to-person transmission in child care
centers and from animal-to-person transmission in an animal
nursery also have been reported (18,19).
In 1994, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists
called for reporting of cryptosporidiosis as a nationally
notifiable disease; the first full year for reporting began in

June 11, 2010

1995. Surveillance data for 1995–2005 have been published
previously (20–22). This report summarizes national crypto­
sporidiosis surveillance data for 2006–2008.

Methods
Case Definition
Confirmed and probable cases of cryptosporidiosis are
reported voluntarily to CDC. A confirmed case of cryptosporidiosis (i.e., one that has a positive laboratory finding) is defined
as one in which Cryptosporidium has been detected in
• organisms in stool, intestinal fluid, or tissue samples or
biopsy specimens;
• antigens in stool or intestinal fluid; or
• nucleic acid in stool, intestinal fluid, or tissue samples or
biopsy specimens (23,24).
A probable case of cryptosporidiosis is a clinically compatible case that is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case
(23). This report includes both confirmed and probable cases
as reported by jurisdictions.

Testing
Testing for Cryptosporidium is not always included in routine
examination of stool for ova and parasites (1). Commercially
available immunoassay kits are available and might be more
sensitive and specific than routine microscopic examination
(25). Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing is an extremely
sensitive and specific detection method and is considered the
“gold standard” by many laboratorians; other immunodiagnostic
kits that do not require microscopy (e.g., enzyme immunoassay [EIA] testing and rapid immunochromatographic cartridge
assays) also are available (25); they do not take the place of routine
ova and parasite examination but might be useful in diagnosing
Cryptosporidium infections. Only molecular testing (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) can be used to speciate Cryptosporidium;
however, no species data are reported to CDC.

Reporting
State, District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC)
health department jurisdictions report cases of cryptosporidiosis
to CDC voluntarily through the National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS). Reports include the patient’s place
of residence (i.e., state and county), age, sex, race, ethnicity (i.e.,
Hispanic or non-Hispanic) and date of illness onset and indicate
whether the case is linked to a known outbreak. An outbreakassociated case is a laboratory-confirmed or probable case that
is linked epidemiologically to an outbreak. Because this report
includes probable cases of cryptosporidiosis, and because some of

Surveillance Summaries

the data were finalized more recently, the number of cases provided
in this report might be slightly higher than the number reported
in CDC’s annual Summary of Notifiable Diseases.

Analysis
Analysis of national cryptosporidiosis surveillance data for
2006–2008 was conducted using SAS v.9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc.; Cary, North Carolina) and the Food Safety Information
Link (FSI Link). FSI Link is an intranet-based tool available
to CDC staff that provides access to NNDSS data and is used
to monitor trends in, and investigate outbreaks of, reportable
foodborne and waterborne diseases. Population data from the
U.S. Census Bureau were used to calculate incidence rates.

Results
During 2006–2008, the number of reported cases of cryptosporidiosis increased dramatically (79.9%), from 6,479 for
2006 to 11,657 for 2007, and then decreased (9.9%) to 10,500
in 2008 (Table 1). All jurisdictions reported cryptosporidiosis
cases during the reporting period, and the number of jurisdictions reporting ≥2.5 cases per 100,000 population increased
from 20 in 2006 to 26 in 2007 and 27 in 2008 (Table 1).
During 2006–2008, incidence of cryptosporidiosis per
100,000 population ranged from 0.2 cases (in Hawaii, 2008) to
71.2 cases (in Utah, 2007) (Table 1; Figure 1). The higher incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Utah in 2007 was influenced by
a single large outbreak among >1,900 persons (26). Increased
reporting of cases also occurred in certain Midwestern, Rocky
Mountain, and Southwestern states.
Surveillance data displayed a bimodal age distribution,
with the greatest number of reported cases occurring among
children aged 1–9 years and among adults aged 25–39 years
(Figure 2). When reports for which a patient’s sex was unknown
or missing were excluded, the percentage of cases reported to
have occurred among males remained consistent at 51.2%
(3,293 of 6,421) for 2006, 49.6% (5,745 of 11,582) for 2007,
and 49.7% (5,181 of 10,415) for 2008 (Table 2).
The majority of cases for which data on race were available
for 2006–2008 occurred among whites, followed by blacks,
Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives
(Table 2). However, data on race were lacking for 26.7%–32.5%
of total annual case reports. Of patients for whom data on ethnicity were reported, 9.4%–15.4% were reported to be Hispanic
(Table 2). However, data on ethnicity were lacking for 38%–44%
of total annual case reports for 2006–2008.
A tenfold increase in reported cryptosporidiosis cases by illness onset date occurred during June–October compared with
January–March (Figure 3). Age-specific analysis indicated that the

3

seasonality in onset of illness was exhibited across all age groups,
particularly among children aged 1–4 and 5–9 years (Figure 4).
The increase in cryptosporidiosis cases reported during
2006–2008 is a continuation of the fourfold increase in
cryptosporidiosis since 2005 (Figure 5). This coincides with a
similar dramatic rise in the number of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks associated with recreational water (Figure 6). During
1988–2006, Cryptosporidium was identified as the causal
agent of 41.8% (100 of 239) of reported recreational waterassociated outbreaks and of 5.7% (13 of 229) of reported
drinking water-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the
United States (15,27–39).

Discussion
National cryptosporidiosis surveillance data are used to assess
the epidemiologic characteristics and disease burden of cryptosporidiosis in the United States. The total number of cases reported
annually and disease incidence increased during 2006–2008 and
has increased dramatically since 2004 (Figures 1 and 5). Whether
this increase reflects changes in reporting patterns and diagnostic
testing practices or an actual change in infection and disease caused
by Cryptosporidium is unclear but was clearly influenced by outbreak-related case reporting (Figure 6). However, outbreak-related
probable case reporting does not account for the entire increase
in reporting (Table 1). This increase also follows the introduction
of nitazoxanide, the first licensed treatment for the disease, which
was licensed in 2002 for children aged 1–11 years and in 2004 for
children aged >11 years and adults (5). Because treatment for cryptosporidiosis now is available, health-care providers might be more
willing to request Cryptosporidium testing, leading to an increase
in subsequent case reports. However, no data exist to support this
hypothesis. The geographic variation, age distribution, and latesummer through early-fall seasonality were consistent with previous
cryptosporidiosis surveillance summaries (20–22).
Cryptosporidiosis is widespread geographically in the United
States. Whereas previous surveillance data indicated that the
diagnosis or reporting of cryptosporidiosis might be higher in
northern or midwestern states (20–22), data from 2006–2008
seem to indicate that cryptosporidiosis incidence has increased
in all states in recent years (Figure 1). Interpretation of this
observation is difficult, and whether this change reflects an
improvement in the diagnostics or detection by reporting
systems of those states or represents an actual increase in the
number of cases is unclear. Varying crypto­sporidiosis surveillance systems and differences in reporting among states might
affect the capability to detect and report cases.
Although cryptosporidiosis affects persons in all age groups,
the number of reported cases was highest among children
aged 1–9 years and adults aged 25–39 years (Figure 2). These

data are consistent with reports of cryptosporidiosis incidence
being higher among younger children and of transmission
to their caregivers (e.g., child care staff, family members,
and other household contacts) (18,20,21,40,41). Because
information regarding immune system status is not collected
as part of NNDSS crypto­sporidiosis reporting, the number
of immunosuppressed persons aged 25–39 years included in
these surveillance data is unknown. However, the introduction of HAART therapy for persons with AIDS has decreased
the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and the amount of severe
cryptosporidiosis being diagnosed among persons with AIDS
in the United States (4,42).
The tenfold increase in onset of cryptosporidiosis occurring
during summer through early fall (Figure 3) is not unexpected.
This increase coincides with increased swimming activities during the summer recreational water season and likely reflects

the contribution of recreational water venues in the transmission of Cryptosporidium, particularly among younger children
(15,27,29,31–38,43). Cryptosporidium is the leading cause of
reported recreational water-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis
(38). Transmission through recreational water is facilitated by the
substantial number of Cryptosporidium oocysts that can be shed
by a single person; the extended periods of time that oocysts can
be shed (11,12); the low infectious dose (9,10); the tolerance of
Cryptosporidium oocysts to chlorine (44); and the prevalence of
improper pool maintenance (i.e., insufficient disinfection, filtration, and recirculation of water), particularly of children’s wading
pools (45). This seasonal variation also has been noted in state,
Canadian provincial, and previous U.S. national surveillance data
for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis (20–22,40,41,46–48).
The marked seasonal variation, higher incidence among
children, and link to recreational water use for cryptospori-

filtered and chlorinated, the treatment was not sufficient to
inactivate Crypto­sporidium, which is highly chlorine tolerant.
After implementation of hyperchlorination and banning of
potentially incontinent children from swimming, followed by
the closure of community pools at the end of the season, the
outbreak began to decline. For 2008, Utah launched an education effort for swimmers and pool operators using multiple
media combined with enhanced cryptosporidiosis surveillance

diosis is highlighted by the large communitywide outbreak
in Utah in 2007 (26). The Utah Department of Health
reported 1,901 confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases during
June–December 2007, compared with the state’s normal
annual median of 16 confirmed cases. The full magnitude
of the outbreak was likely much larger as investigations were
limited to laboratory-confirmed cases. Epidemiologic studies
implicated multiple recreational water venues as the source
of this outbreak, and 80% of patients reported attending
recreational water venues within 14 days of illness onset. In
addition, 20% of patients reported swimming while ill with
diarrhea, which implicated recreational water venues as an
ongoing source of Cryptosporidium transmission. Children aged
<5 years represented 32% of patients (median age: 9 years).
After the infection rate peaked in mid-August, with nearly 60
confirmed cases of reported onset of illness on a single day, the
Utah Department of Health further intensified control efforts,
including hyperchlorination of pools and banning of children
aged <5 years from community pools. Disease incidence rates
began to decline after the stricter control measures and then
continued to decline with the closing of seasonal pools in
September. As the outbreak progressed, more patients reported
having no recreational water exposure but had contact with
persons who were ill with diarrhea. This finding supports a
role for secondary person-to-person transmission in communitywide outbreaks. The lack of appropriate stool specimens
prevented genotyping, which would have aided in determining chains of transmission. Although the water venues were

Cryptosporidium testing more often when ova and parasite
exams are ordered. Its low infectious dose (9), protracted
communicability (11,12), and chlorine tolerance (44) make
Cryptosporidium ideally suited for transmission through drinking and recreational water, food, and both person-to-person
and animal-to-person contact. Several studies have characterized risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium. Persons at
increased risk for infection include 1) those who have contact

and prevention efforts; only 49 cryptosporidiosis cases were
reported in 2008 (Table 1).
Outbreak reports reflecting the multiple routes of transmission for Cryptosporidium also were reported during 2006–2008.
Twelve cryptosporidiosis outbreaks associated with food, animal
contact, or person-to-person transmission were reported to
CDC during this period; these outbreaks affected >125 persons
(49,50). Six outbreaks were associated with animal exposure,
three involved unknown exposure in the home, one was associated with a restaurant, and one was associated with a child care
facility. The remaining outbreak involved increased reporting of
cryptosporidiosis cases in Colorado, which involved multiple
risk factors. Investigation determined that ill persons were more
likely to have swallowed untreated water from a lake, river, or
stream; have had exposure to recreational water; or have had
contact with a child in a child care program or in diapers (51).
Cryptosporidiosis (as with all diseases caused by enteric
pathogens) is likely underreported because 1) not all infected
persons are symptomatic, 2) those who are symptomatic do
not always seek medical care (52,53), 3) health-care providers
infrequently include laboratory diagnostics in their evaluation
of nonbloody diarrheal diseases (52), 4) the majority of physicians do not specifically request testing for Cryptosporidium as
part of ova and parasite testing (54), 5) a majority of laboratories do not test for Cryptosporidium unless it is specifically
requested (55), and 6) case-reports are not always completed
for positive laboratory results or forwarded to public health
officials (56). The licensing of the first treatment for cryptosporidiosis (5) might influence health-care providers to request

with infected animals, 2) those who have ingested contaminated recreational (e.g., lake, river, pool, or hot tub) or drinking water, 3) close contacts of infected persons (e.g., those in
the same family or household or in child care settings), and 4)
travelers to disease-endemic areas (1,43,57–59).
In recent years, three studies conducted in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Australia used multivariate analysis to identify risk factors associated with sporadic
cryptosporidiosis. The important risk factors found in these
studies included contact with persons with diarrhea, particularly incontinent persons such as young children, and contact
with cattle, especially calves (43,58,59). The U.S. (43) and
U.K. (59) studies also identified travel abroad as a risk factor
whereas the Australian (58) study excluded persons who had
recently traveled abroad to better characterize endemic disease.
In addition, the U.S. study identified swimming in fresh water
as a risk factor for becoming ill with cryptosporidiosis, and the
U.K. and Australian studies identified drinking unboiled water
from rural sources as a risk factor.
Several additional studies have identified contact with cattle
as a significant risk factor for sporadic cryptosporidiosis. During
a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom in
2001, millions of animals were slaughtered, and access to the
countryside was restricted. During this time, the counties with
the heaviest restrictions experienced an 82% reduction in the
number of cryptosporidiosis cases reported, particularly in the
transmission peak temporally corresponding with the spring
calving season, suggesting an association between cattle contact and human disease in the United Kingdom (60). During
2003–2005, genotyping was performed on samples from

June 11, 2010

49 sporadic human cases of cryptosporidiosis in Wisconsin.
Zoonotic genotypes C. parvum and the cervine type were
identified in 46 of 49 cases. Nine different subgenotypes of
C. parvum were identified, all of which had been previously
identified in cattle in the surrounding region (61). Wisconsin
has a high rate of cryptosporidiosis disease, but very few cases
are associated with outbreaks (Table 1). Sporadic cryptosporidiosis caused by zoonotic transmission from cattle is the likely
main cause of this disease in Wisconsin (61).
Non–C. parvum or C. hominis Cryptosporidium species are associated less frequently with human infection. The avian pathogen
C. meleagridis is emerging as an important zoonotic pathogen in
immune-competent individuals in some communities. In Peru,
where a significant number of infections are attributable to zoonotic
transmission, 10%–20% of infections are caused by C. meleagridis
(62). However, C. meleagridis is detected rarely in immune-competent patients in industrialized countries (63, 64).
Cryptosporidium cannot multiply in food, so transmission
of the parasite through food usually occurs through direct
contamination of the food by an ill person or fecal contamination caused by improper hygiene practices during food production, processing, or preparation. Limited outbreaks have
been associated with nonpasteurized apple cider made from
improperly cleaned fruit that was exposed to cattle feces in the
orchard (17,65). A 1998 outbreak involving 88 persons in the
District of Columbia was traced back to contaminated food
that had been handled by a cafeteria worker who was sick with
cryptosporidiosis (16). The food handler had recently spent
some time with a young relative who was sick with vomiting
and diarrhea and another relative who also had become ill
with the same symptoms (16). Cryptosporidium oocysts have
been detected on produce at markets (66,67). These vegetables
were likely contaminated by Cryptosporidium-contaminated
water used for irrigation or by the feces of wild animals with
access to the fields (68,69). Despite the possibility of produce
contamination at the farm level, the link between detection of
Cryptosporidium on fresh produce and human infection is not
well understood (70). In contrast, case-control studies among
persons with sporadic cryptosporidiosis cases have determined
that consumption of raw vegetables, particularly carrots, is a
protective factor (43,58,59). This finding might be explained
by repeated exposures to the small amounts of Cryptosporidium
on the vegetables providing a protective immunity or high fiber
in the diet increasing gut motility and thereby preventing the
oocysts from invading the intestinal mucosa (43).
Water appears to be a more important transmission route
for Cryptosporidium and frequently is implicated in cryptosporidiosis outbreaks and in studies of sporadic cases (42,43)
(Figure 6). Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis associated with
treated recreational water include fecal accidents in the pool,

diapered toddlers in the pool, swimming while ill with diarrhea, and swallowing pool water (38,58). Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis associated with drinking water include drinking
large amounts of unboiled rural or well water and failure of
treatment protocols for public water supplies (58).
Although no formalized national plan exists for preventing
cryptosporidiosis in the United States, multiple efforts are
focused on reducing the transmission of the parasite through
the two major routes of waterborne transmission. For drinking water, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
implemented multiple regulations designed to improve the
safety of surface water (e.g., lakes and rivers) supplies, including multiple regulatory changes following an outbreak of
cryptosporidiosis in 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that
sickened >400,000 persons using the city water supply (34,71).
Since 1993, no Cryptosporidium outbreaks associated with
use of community surface water supplies have occurred in the
United States (28,30–34,39). In addition, a study conducted
during 1996–2004 in the United Kingdom suggests that
improvements in drinking water treatment and source water
protection might be responsible for decreasing the number of
cryptosporidiosis cases in humans caused by C. parvum from
ruminants (72,73). EPA is implementing the Groundwater
Rule in an effort to decrease the risk associated with use of
groundwater (well) supplies (39). This regulatory change

might decrease the occurrence of Cryptosporidium outbreaks
associated with groundwater use.
For recreational water, Cryptosporidium remains the leading
cause of diarrheal illness outbreaks, especially in chlorinated
venues (38). Recently, cryptosporidiosis outbreaks that began
in treated recreational water venues have spread to communitywide transmission in multiple venues (e.g., child care centers
and schools) (26). In addition, limited outbreaks in child
care centers or schools can be amplified into communitywide
outbreaks by the use of recreational water by ill persons (74).
To address these challenges, CDC has collaborated with state
health departments to develop guidelines for rapidly implementing community control measures when a cryptosporidiosis
outbreak is identified (26). Efforts to reduce the transmission of
this chlorine-tolerant pathogen in pools will require a concerted
effort to move beyond existing pool practices to include new
secondary disinfection technology (ultraviolet light or ozone
inactivation), operational improvements (use of filtration
enhancements that improve Cryptosporidium removal), and
public education to reduce continued swimming by persons
who are ill with diarrhea.
In the United States, no federal oversight of chlorinated
swimming venues occurs. All pool codes are reviewed and
approved by state or local public health officials. As a result,
the United States has no uniform national standards governing the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of

MMWR

swimming pools and other treated recreational water venues.
To provide guidance and improve nationwide pool code
uniformity, CDC is sponsoring an effort to develop a datadriven, knowledge-based National Model Aquatic Health Code
(available at http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/
pools/mahc/). This effort involves state, local, and federal
public health officials and the aquatics industry in creating a
voluntary model regulatory structure for state and local health
departments to use in developing pool codes. Health communication efforts also should continue to educate swimmers
about the hazards of swallowing pool water and swimming
while ill with diarrhea.

Limitations

status, and lack of information on risk factors or attributable
fractions by exposure types. Despite these limitations, these
data provide the only national estimate of the number of cases
of cryptosporidiosis that is available.

Conclusion
Continued efforts to reduce risk and improve diagnosis and
reporting of cryptosporidiosis are needed to decrease the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in the United States. Prevention
measures (Box 1) and measures to improve surveillance and
prevention for cryptosporidiosis and increase understanding
of its epidemiology and the associated disease burden (Box 2)
have been recommended. Additional information about cryptosporidiosis epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention,
and control is available at http://www.cdc.gov/crypto.

BOX 1. CDC recommendations to prevent and control cryptosporidiosis

Practice good hygiene.
• Everywhere
–– Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20
seconds, rub hands together vigorously, and scrub
all surfaces
ºº before preparing or eating food,
ºº after using the toilet,
ºº after changing diapers or cleaning up a child who
has used the toilet,
ºº before and after tending to someone who is ill
with diarrhea, and
ºº after handling an animal or its feces.
Additional information about hygiene is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene.
• At child care facilities
–– To reduce risk for disease transmission, exclude children with diarrhea from child care settings until the
diarrhea has stopped.
• At recreational water venues
–– Protect others by not swimming while experiencing
diarrhea (this is essential for children in diapers and
aquatics staff). If cryptosporidiosis is diagnosed, do
not swim for at least 2 weeks after diarrhea stops.
–– Shower before entering the water.
–– Wash children thoroughly (especially their bottoms)
with soap and water after they use the toilet or their
diapers are changed and before they enter the water.
–– Take children on frequent bathroom breaks and check
their diapers often.
–– Change diapers in the bathroom, not at the
poolside.
Additional information about recreational water illnesses
and how to stop them from spreading is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming.
• Around animals
–– Minimize contact with the feces of all animals, particularly young animals.
–– When cleaning up animal feces, wear disposable
gloves, and always wash hands when finished.
–– Wash hands after any contact with animals or their
living areas.
• Outside
–– Wash hands after gardening, even if wearing gloves.
• Immunocompromised persons
–– Avoid close contact with anyone who has
cryptosporidiosis.
–– Do not handle animal feces because infection can be
life threatening for immunocompromised persons.

Additional information about cryptosporidiosis prevention and control is available at http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/
gen_info/prevent.html.
Avoid water that might be contaminated.
• Do not swallow water while swimming in swimming
pools, spas, interactive fountains, lakes, rivers, springs,
ponds, streams, or the ocean.
• Reduce contamination of treated recreational water
venues by having pool operators install in-line secondary disinfection systems (e.g., ultraviolet light, ozone) to
inactive this chlorine-tolerant parasite.
• Do not drink untreated water from lakes, rivers, springs,
ponds, streams, or shallow wells.
• Do not drink inadequately treated water or ice made
from water during communitywide outbreaks caused
by contaminated drinking water.
• Do not use or drink inadequately treated water or use
ice when traveling in countries where the water supply
might be unsafe.
• If the safety of drinking water is in doubt (e.g., outbreak,
poor sanitation, or lack of water treatment systems),
–– drink bottled water
–– disinfect water by heating it to a rolling boil for 1
minute, or
–– use a filter that has been tested and rated by National
Safety Foundation (NSF) Standard 53 or NSF
Standard 58 for cyst and oocyst reduction; filtered
water will need additional treatment to kill or inactivate bacteria and viruses.
Additional information about water filters is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/gen_info/filters.html.
Avoid eating food that might be contaminated.
• Use safe, uncontaminated water to wash all food that is
to be eaten raw.
• After washing vegetables and fruit in safe, uncontaminated water, peel them before eating them raw.
• Avoid eating uncooked foods when traveling in countries
with poor water treatment and food sanitation.
Information about how to prevent illnesses while traveling is available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/
safe-food-water.aspx.
Prevent contact and contamination with feces during sex.
• Use a barrier during oral-anal sex.
• Wash hands immediately after handling a condom used
during anal sex and after touching the anus or rectal area.

BOX 2. CDC recommendations to improve surveillance for
cryptosporidiosis and increase understanding of its epidemiology and associated disease burden

• Encourage health-care providers to consider and
specifically request testing for Cryptosporidium in
the evaluation of gastrointestinal illness.
• Encourage laboratories to test routinely for
Cryptosporidium when examining stool for ova and
parasites.
• Expand the use of molecular testing and the application of molecular epidemiology to Cryptosporidiumpositive samples.
• Continue to educate health-care providers as well as
public and private laboratories to improve reporting
of cases of cryptosporidiosis to jurisdictional health
departments.
• Encourage jurisdictional health departments to
report cryptosporidiosis data to CDC through the
National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS).
• Publish and distribute cryptosporidiosis surveillance data regularly for public health education
purposes.
• Conduct further epidemiologic studies of the geographic variability, incidence, and risk factors for
cryptosporidiosis.

Abstract
Problem/Condition: Giardiasis is a nationally notifiable gastrointestinal illness caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia
intestinalis.
Reporting Period: 2006–2008.
System Description: State, commonwealth, territorial, and two metropolitan health departments voluntarily report
cases of giardiasis through CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.
Results: During 2006–2008, the total number of reported cases of giardiasis increased slightly from 19,239 for 2006
to 19,794 for 2007 and decreased slightly to 19,140 for 2008. During this period, 49 jurisdictions reported giardiasis
cases; giardiasis is a reportable condition in 45 states (not reportable in Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,
and Texas). A greater number of case reports were received for children aged 1–9 years and for adults aged 35–44 years
compared with other age groups. Incidence of giardiasis was highest in northern states. Peak onset of illness occurred
annually during early summer through early fall.
Interpretation: Transmission of giardiasis occurs throughout the United States, with more frequent diagnosis or reporting occurring in northern states. However, state incidence figures should be compared with caution because individual
state surveillance systems have varying capabilities to detect cases. The seasonal peak in age-specific case reports coincides
with the summer recreational water season and likely reflects increased outdoor activities and exposures such as camping
and use of communal swimming venues (e.g., lakes, rivers, swimming pools, and water parks) by young children.
Public Health Action: Local and state health departments can use giardiasis surveillance data to better understand
the epidemiologic characteristics and the disease burden of giardiasis in the United States, design efforts to prevent the
spread of disease, and establish research priorities.

Introduction
Giardia intestinalis (also known as G. lamblia and G. duodenalis) is the most common intestinal parasite of humans identified in the United States (1). This flagellated protozoan causes
a generally self-limited clinical illness (i.e., giardiasis) typically
characterized by diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, weight
loss, and malabsorption; asymptomatic infection also occurs
frequently (2–4). Case reports have associated giardiasis with
the development of chronic enteric disorders, allergies, and
reactive arthritis (5–7).
Giardia infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and
results from the ingestion of Giardia cysts through the consumption of fecally contaminated food or water or through

person-to-person (or, to a lesser extent, animal-to-person)
transmission. The cysts are infectious immediately upon being
excreted in feces. The infectious dose is low; ingestion of 10
cysts has been reported to cause infection (8). Infected persons
8
9
have been reported to shed 10 –10 cysts in their stool per day
and to excrete cysts for months (8–10). Effective therapies are
available for patients with symptomatic giardiasis, including
metronidazole, nitazoxanide, tinidazole, paromomycin, furazolidone, and quinacrine (11).
Giardia is distributed globally and has been detected in
nearly all classes of vertebrates, including domestic animals
and wildlife (12). Although G. intestinalis infects both humans
and animals, the role of zoonotic transmission to humans and
the importance of animal contamination of food and water
are being re-examined. Recent advances in molecular epidemiology have permitted identification of specialized genetic
groups (i.e., assemblages) that are relatively species-specific.
Assemblages A and B of G. intestinalis infect primarily humans
and primates; assemblages C and D infect dogs, assemblage F
infects cats, assemblage E infects hoofstock, and assemblage G

infects rodents (13). These findings suggest that G. intestinalis
does not have as high a level of zoonotic disease transmission
potential as thought previously (13).
Persons at increased risk for infection include 1) travelers to
disease-endemic areas, 2) children in child care settings, 3) close
contacts of infected persons (e.g., those in the same family or
household or in a child care setting), 4) persons who ingest contaminated drinking water, 5) persons who swallow contaminated
recreational water (e.g., water in lakes, rivers, and pools), 6) persons
taking part in outdoor activities (e.g., backpacking or camping)
who consume unfiltered, untreated water or who fail to practice
good hygienic behaviors (e.g., hand washing), 7) persons who
have contact with infected animals, and 8) men who have sex with
men (2,14–18). Giardiasis does not appear to be opportunistic in
persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The relative
contribution of person-to-person, animal-to-person, foodborne,
and waterborne transmission to sporadic human giardiasis in the
United States is not well understood.
Although giardiasis cases occur sporadically, outbreaks from
multiple transmission routes are well documented. During
1997–2006, Giardia was identified as a causal agent of six
(3.7%) of 162 reported recreational water-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks and of 15 (10.6%) of 141 reported drinking
water-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States
(19–24). Worldwide, it is one of the most frequently identified
parasites associated with waterborne disease outbreaks (25).
Foodborne outbreaks of giardiasis are reported rarely. During
1998–2007, of 7,650 foodborne outbreaks with an identified
etiology, 15 (0.2%) were attributed to Giardia. (26). Improper
hygiene practices have contributed to outbreaks of giardiasis
associated with food (27), person-to-person transmission in
child care centers (28), and communitywide outbreaks with
waterborne and person-to-person transmission routes (29).
Outbreaks associated with drinking water might be associated
with animal contamination of water systems (30,31). However,
the zoonotic transmission of giardiasis is not believed to play
a major role in human disease (32).
In 1992, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists
assigned a reporting number for giardiasis (code 11570) to
facilitate transmission of reported giardiasis data to CDC.
Surveillance data for 1992–2005 have been published previously (33–35). Reporting of giardiasis as a nationally notifiable disease began in 2002. This report summarizes national
giardiasis surveillance data for 2006–2008.

Methods
Case Definition
Confirmed and probable cases of giardiasis are reported
voluntarily to CDC. A confirmed case of giardiasis (i.e., one
that has a positive laboratory finding) is defined as the detection of Giardia intestinalis
• cysts in stool specimens or trophozoites in stool specimens,
duodenal fluid, or small-bowel tissue by microscopic
examination using staining methods (e.g., trichrome) or
direct fluorescent antibody assays (DFA); or
• antigens in stool specimens by immunodiagnostic testing
(e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) (36).
A probable case of giardiasis is a clinically compatible case
that is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case (36).

Testing
Because Giardia cysts can be excreted intermittently, multiple
stool collections (i.e., three stool specimens collected every other
day) increase test sensitivity (37). The use of concentration methods and trichrome staining might not be sufficient to identify
Giardia because variability in the concentration of organisms
in the stool can make this infection difficult to diagnose. For
this reason, fecal immunoassays that are more sensitive and
specific should be used (38). Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)
testing is an extremely sensitive and specific detection method
and is considered the “gold standard” by many laboratorians;
other immunodiagnostic kits that do not require microscopy
(e.g., enzyme immunoassay [EIA] testing and rapid immunochromatographic cartridge assays) also are available (38); they
do not take the place of routine ova and parasite examination
but might be useful in diagnosing Giardia infections. Only
molecular testing (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PRC]) can
be used to subtype Giardia; however, no subtyping data are
reported to CDC.

Reporting
Health departments in 45 states (all except Indiana,
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas), the
District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and Guam voluntarily report
laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of giardiasis to CDC
through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System
(NNDSS). Reports include the patient’s place of residence (i.e.,
state and county), age, sex, race, ethnicity (i.e., Hispanic or
non-Hispanic), and date of illness onset and indicate whether
the case is linked epidemiologically to a known outbreak.
Because this report includes probable cases of giardiasis, and



Vol. 59 / SS-6

Surveillance Summaries

because certain data were finalized recently, the number of
cases might differ slightly from the number reported in CDC’s
annual Summary of Notifiable Diseases.

Analysis
Analysis of national giardiasis surveillance data for 2006–
2008 was conducted using SAS v.9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.; Cary,
North Carolina) and the Food Safety Information Link (FSI
Link). FSI Link is an intranet-based tool available to CDC staff
that provides access to NNDSS data and is used to monitor
trends in and investigate outbreaks of reportable foodborne
and waterborne diseases. Population data from the U.S. Census
Bureau were used to calculate incidence rates.

Results
During 2006–2008, the total number of reported cases of
giardiasis increased 2.9%, from 19,239 for 2006 to 19,794
for 2007 and then decreased 3.3% to 19,140 for 2008
(Table 1). During this period, 49 jurisdictions (45 states, two
cities, Puerto Rico, and Guam) reported giardiasis cases. No
reports were received from the five states (Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas) in which giardiasis is
not a reportable disease.
For 2008, among jurisdictions reporting cases, incidence
of giardiasis per 100,000 population ranged from 2.2 cases in
Arizona to 33.8 cases in Vermont (Table 1; Figure 1). Vermont
reported the greatest number of cases per 100,000 population
for each of the 3 years of the reporting period. Northern states
reported more cases annually per 100,000 population than
southern states (Table 1; Figure 1).
Surveillance data displayed a bimodal age distribution,
with the greatest number of reported cases occurring among
children aged 1–4 and 5–9 years and adults aged 35–44 years
(Figure 2). When reports for which a patient’s sex was missing
or unknown were excluded, the percentage of cases reported
to have occurred among males remained consistent at 56.2%
(10,671 of 18,994) for 2006, 56.5% (11,069 of 19,585) for
2007, and 56.7% (10,786 of 19,019) for 2008 (Table 2).
The majority of cases for which data on race were available
for 2006–2008 occurred among whites, followed by blacks,
Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives
(Table 2). However, data on race were not included for 41.2%–
43.7% of total annual case reports. Although 7.2%–8.2%
of patients for whom data on ethnicity were reported were
identified as Hispanic, data on ethnicity were lacking for
49.3%–52.2% of total annual case reports.
A twofold increase in reported giardiasis cases by onset
of illness occurred during June–October compared with

January–March (Figure 3). Age-specific analysis indicated
a twofold increase in onset of illness during June–October
among all age groups. This seasonality is particularly evident
among children (Figure 4). The highest numbers of giardiasis
cases were reported among children aged 1–4 and 5–9 years
and adults aged 40–44 years (Figure 4). The incidence of giardiasis has remained relatively stable since it became nationally
notifiable in 2002 (Figure 5).

Discussion
National giardiasis surveillance data are used to assess the
epidemiologic characteristics and disease burden of giardiasis in
the United States. Following a gradual decline in case reports
during 1996–2001 (33,34), the number of case reports and
disease incidence appears to have stabilized, coinciding with the
disease becoming nationally notifiable in 2002 (Figure 5).
Giardiasis is widespread geographically in the United States. The
number of cases reported is higher in the northern states (Figure 1).
However, because differences in giardiasis surveillance systems
among states can affect the capability to detect cases, whether this
finding is of biologic significance or only reflects differences in
case detection or reporting is difficult to determine.
Although giardiasis affects persons in all age groups, the
number of reported cases was highest among children aged 1–9
years and adults aged 35–44 years. These data for younger age
groups are consistent with reports published previously of giardiasis incidence being higher among younger children as well as
contributing to transmission to their caregivers (e.g., child care
facility staff, family members, and other household contacts)
(2,33–35,39,40). Giardia was identified frequently as the cause
of diarrhea among children examined in outpatient clinics (41),
and transmission from ill children to household contacts has
been documented in outbreak investigations (29,42).
The marked seasonality in the onset of illness occurring in
early summer through early fall is not unexpected. A twofold
increase in transmission of giardiasis occurred during the summer, coinciding with increased outdoor activities (e.g., camping and swimming). This increase likely reflects increased use
of untreated water for drinking (e.g., lakes and rivers) while
outdoors as well as increased use of community swimming
(essentially communal bathing) venues by younger children
during the summer months. In addition to animal contamination of surface water, transmission through use of surface water
(e.g., lakes and rivers) and disinfected venues (e.g., swimming
pools and water parks) is facilitated by the substantial number
of Giardia cysts that can be shed by a single person (9); the
extended periods of time that cysts can be shed (10); the low
infectious dose (8); the moderate chlorine tolerance of Giardia
(43); the prevalence of improper pool maintenance (i.e., insuf-

ficient disinfection, filtration, and recirculation of water),
particularly of children’s wading pools (44); the prevalence
of Giardia in fecal material in pools (45); and documented
transmission of Giardia infection among diapered children
(28,42,46) who use swimming venues regularly. This seasonal
variation also has been noted in state, Canadian provincial,
and previous U.S. national surveillance data for giardiasis and
cryptosporidiosis (33–35,39,40).
Among patients for whom data on sex were reported, a
majority of cases occurred among males (Table 2). This might
be attributable in part to sexual contact among men who have
sex with men (16). However, the majority of cases occurred in
males in nearly every age group (except those aged ≥65 years),
which suggests the influence of other factors.
Outbreaks have been linked to drinking water sources contaminated with Giardia. In 2007, a neighborhood outbreak of
giardiasis in New Hampshire was linked to contamination of a
ground water well used for drinking water by the community
(30). Thirty-one confirmed or probable cases were identified
and determined to be associated with drinking tap water. One
of the groundwater wells supplying the community was dug in
close proximity to surface water, a small stream, where evidence
of beaver inhabitation was discovered. The well tested positive
for fecal coliforms and was disconnected from the water supply, after which the outbreak declined. PCR testing was used
to genotype the cases as assemblage B, a subtype that has not
been reported previously in humans but has been found in
beavers in nearby Massachusetts. Two beavers from the area
tested negative for Giardia, but beavers could not be ruled out
as the source because shedding of cysts is sporadic.
Although untreated or unfiltered drinking water is a risk factor for giardiasis, contaminated recreational water has also been
implicated as a source of illnesses and outbreaks. In a study of
sporadic giardiasis in England, swallowing water while swim-

ming and recreational contact with fresh water were both risk
factors for contracting Giardia (18). An outbreak in Florida
in 2006 at an interactive fountain was caused by Giardia and
Cryptosporidium and resulted in illness among 57 persons over
a 2-month period (47). Investigation of this outbreak revealed
deficiencies in the design, maintenance, and operation of the
interactive fountain as well as bather behavior (i.e., swimming
while ill with diarrhea) that led to ongoing contamination of
the interactive fountain.
Foodborne transmission of Giardia generally occurs by direct
contamination by an infected food handler (27), the use of
contaminated water in the preparation of food (48), or animal
contamination of food (49). In a study of sporadic giardiasis in
England, eating lettuce was associated with increased risk for
giardiasis (18). The use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation

became ill after a restaurant-catered lunch at a school. A third
suspected outbreak occurred in Florida, where four patients had
eaten at the same restaurant. In 2007, two confirmed foodborne
outbreaks occurred in Missouri and Vermont (26). In Missouri,
15 attendees at a catered event became ill after eating chicken
parmesan and lettuce salads. The caterer was not licensed and
worked out of her home (26). In Vermont, 36 boys became ill
at a summer camp with no running water or electricity. The
source of the outbreak was not identified (26).
The relative importance of zoonotic transmission of Giardia,
either directly or indirectly (e.g., through water or food contamination) is unknown. Cattle have been suspected to contribute
to the contamination of drinking water with Giardia as a result
of farm run-off and the land application of animal waste. In the
United States and Australia, livestock are infected predominately
with the bovine-specific genetic assemblage E (which is not infective to humans). Assemblage A (which is a human pathogen) can
be found in a small proportion of cattle, but investigations of
contaminated water supplies typically incriminate effluent from
human waste as the source of contamination (12). However, as the
New Hampshire outbreak demonstrates, other potential zoonotic
sources exist in wildlife. In a molecular study, the same genetic
assemblage B was identified in samples from humans, muskrats,
beavers, and rabbits, suggesting the potential for zoonotic transmission or water contamination from these species (51).
Household pets also represent a potential source of zoonotic
transmission. Giardia is the most prevalent intestinal parasite
in otherwise healthy pet dogs in Australia; 9.4% of dogs in a
study tested positive on fecal specimens; assemblages C and D
were identified most frequently (52). A study in India identified

identical assemblages (A and B) in humans and their pet dogs
(53). Because of poor hygiene in the village, including the dogs’
access to human feces, whether the infection was of zoonotic
or anthroponotic transmission was unclear. Ongoing advances
in molecular epidemiology will increase understanding of the
importance of animals as a risk factor for giardiasis (54).

Despite the zoonotic potential, infected human waste is the
greatest known risk factor for infection with Giardia, whether
transmission is through direct fecal-oral contact or indirectly
through ingestion of fecally contaminated water. In a study of
sporadic giardiasis in New Zealand, exposure to human waste
was a significant risk factor, specifically exposure to diaper
changing and occupational exposure to human waste (55). The
study also determined that housewives and nursing mothers
were at increased risk for giardiasis compared with other social
groups, which is consistent with increased risk for exposure
to diapers (55). Children attending child care facilities are at
increased risk for giardiasis (15), and outbreaks have occurred
in child care facilities, leading to infections among caregivers
and household members (28,56,57).
Giardiasis (as with all diseases caused by enteric pathogens)
is likely underreported because 1) not all infected persons are
symptomatic, 2) those who are symptomatic do not always
seek medical care (58,59), 3) health-care providers do not
always include laboratory diagnostics in their evaluation of
non-bloody diarrheal diseases (58), 4) case reports are not
always completed for positive laboratory results or forwarded
to public health officials (60), and 5) giardiasis is not a reportable disease in five states.
Its low infectious dose, protracted communicability, and
moderate chlorine tolerance make Giardia ideally suited for
transmission through drinking and recreational water, food,
and person-to-person contact. Strategies to reduce the incidence of giardiasis have focused on reducing waterborne and
person-to-person transmission. The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) enacted the Surface Water Treatment Rule
(SWTR) in 1989 and the Interim Enhanced SWTR in 1998
(21). These regulations have decreased the number of giardiasis

June 11, 2010

outbreaks associated with community drinking water systems
(20–24). In 2006, EPA finalized the Ground Water Rule to
address contamination of public ground water (well) systems,
which is likely to reduce the number of groundwater-associated
outbreaks of giardiasis. Person-to-person transmission of
Giardia is difficult to interrupt in a systematic fashion, particularly in childcare settings (56). Adherence to appropriate
infection control (e.g., exclusion of children ill with diarrhea,
hand washing, diaper changing, and separation of ill children)
policies is recommended for controlling giardiasis, and other
enteric pathogens, in these group settings (57).

Limitations
The data provided in this report are subject to several limitations, including likely underreporting of cases, lack of information on race and ethnicity on the majority of case-reports, and
absence of information on risk factors or attributable fractions by
exposure types. Despite these limitations, the data in this report
provide the only national overview of giardiasis available.

Conclusion
Continued efforts to reduce risk and improve diagnosis and
reporting of giardiasis are needed to decrease the transmission
of giardiasis in the United States. Prevention measures (Box 1)
and measures to improve surveillance for giardiasis and increase
understanding of its epidemiology and the associated disease
burden (Box 2) have been recommended. Additional information about giardiasis is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/

BOX 1. CDC recommendations to prevent and control giardiasis

Practice good hygiene.
• Everywhere
–– Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20
seconds, rub hands together vigorously, and scrub
all surfaces
ºº before preparing or eating food,
ºº after using the toilet,
ºº after changing diapers or cleaning up a child who
has used the toilet,
ºº before and after tending to someone who is ill
with diarrhea, and
ºº after handling an animal or its waste.
Additional information about hygiene is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene.
• At child care facilities
–– To reduce risk for disease transmission, exclude children with diarrhea from child care settings until the
diarrhea has stopped.
• At recreational water venues
–– Protect others by not swimming if while experiencing
diarrhea (this is essential for children in diapers and
aquatics staff).
–– Shower before entering the water.
–– Wash children thoroughly (especially their bottoms)
with soap and water after they use the toilet or their
diapers are changed and before they enter the water.
–– Take children on frequent bathroom breaks and check
their diapers often.
–– Change diapers in the bathroom, not at the
poolside.
Additional information about recreational water illnesses
and how to stop them from spreading is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming.
• Around animals
–– Minimize contact with the stool of all animals, particularly young animals.
–– When cleaning up animal feces, wear disposable
gloves, and always wash hands when finished.
–– Wash hands after any contact with animals or their
living areas.
• Outside
–– Wash hands after gardening, even if wearing gloves.

Avoid water that might be contaminated.
• Do not swallow water while swimming in swimming
pools, spas, interactive fountains, lakes, rivers, springs,
ponds, streams, or the ocean.
• Do not drink untreated water from lakes, rivers, springs,
ponds, streams, or shallow wells.
• Do not drink inadequately treated water or ice made
from water during communitywide outbreaks caused
by contaminated drinking water.
• Do not use or drink inadequately treated water or use
ice when traveling in countries where the water supply
might be unsafe.
• If the safety of drinking water is in doubt (e.g., outbreak,
poor sanitation, or lack of water treatment systems),
–– drink bottled water
–– disinfect water by heating it to a rolling boil for 1
minute, or
–– use a filter that has been tested and rated by National
Safety Foundation (NSF) Standard 53 or NSF
Standard 58 for cyst and oocyst reduction; filtered
water will need additional treatment to kill or inactivate bacteria and viruses.
Information about water filters is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/gen_info/filters.html.
Avoid eating food that might be contaminated.
• Use safe, uncontaminated water to wash all food that is
to be eaten raw.
• After washing vegetables and fruit in safe, uncontaminated water, peel them before eating them raw.
• Avoid eating uncooked foods when traveling in countries
with poor water treatment and food sanitation.
Information about how to prevent illnesses while traveling is available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/
safe-food-water.aspx.
Prevent contact and contamination with feces during sex.
• Use a barrier during oral-anal sex.
• Wash hands immediately after handling a condom used
during anal sex and after touching the anus or rectal area.

BOX 2. CDC Recommendations to improve surveillance for
giardiasis and increase understanding of its epidemiology
and associated disease burden

• Encourage health-care providers to consider and
specifically request testing for Giardia in the workup
of gastrointestinal illness (i.e., order testing of stool
for ova and parasites).
• Continue to educate and encourage health-care
providers as well as public and private laboratories
to improve reporting of cases of giardiasis to jurisdictional health departments.
• Expand the use of molecular testing and the application of molecular epidemiology to Giardia-positive
samples.
• Encourage jurisdictional health departments
to report giardiasis data to CDC through the
National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS).
• Publish and distribute giardiasis surveillance data
regularly for public health education purposes.
• Conduct further epidemiologic studies of the
geographic variability, incidence, and risk factors
for giardiasis.
