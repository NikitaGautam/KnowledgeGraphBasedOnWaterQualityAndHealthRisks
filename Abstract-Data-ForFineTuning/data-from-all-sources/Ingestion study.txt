participate in limited-contact recreational activities on surface waters. Mean and upper

Introduction

Water recreation has been associated with outbreaks of acute
gastrointestinal illness caused by viruses, bacteria, and
protozoa (Dziuban et al., 2006; Yoder et al., 2004). Higher rates
of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) have been reported

5

among swimmers compared to non-swimmers (USEPA, 1983,
1984; Seyfried et al., 1985; McBride et al., 1998; Wade et al.,
2008; Colford et al., 2007). Controlled immersion trials have
demonstrated higher rates of AGI among those randomized to
perform head immersion compared to a non-immersion group
(Kay et al., 1994; Wiedenmann et al., 2006; Fleisher et al., 2010).

Epidemiologic studies require substantial resources and time,
and may generate results that have limited generalizability to
settings with different types of recreational use or pollutant
sources. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) offers
an alternative method for evaluating health risks for a particular water quality measure or for a range of water quality
measures (Wong et al., 2009; Ashbolt et al., 2010). Conversely,
reverse QMRA has can performed to identify an acceptable
level of water quality for a given targeted risk level and has
recently been utilized to estimate the contribution of specific
pathogens to known rates of recreational waterborne illness
(Soller et al., 2010).
Limited-contact recreation activities are popular, particularly at inland waters. The number of people who engage in
limited-contact activities per year in the US (in millions) are:
fishing (71), motor boating (52), canoeing (20.7), rowing (9.4),
and kayaking per year (6.4) (Cordell et al., 2004). Despite the
large number of people exposed through limited-contact
recreation, very little is known about the health risks of these
activities. Recently site-specific standards for limited (or
“secondary”) contact recreation have been explored in the
United States for waters that do not support full-contact
recreation. These include efforts in Idaho (Idaho Department
of Environmental Quality, 2004), Illinois (Illinois Pollution
Control Board, 2010), Kansas (USEPA, 2003), Missouri
(Missouri Coalition for the Environment, 2010), Texas (Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality, 2009) and Utah (Utah
Department of Environmental Quality, 2008). Estimated rates
of water ingestion could serve as inputs in risk assessments
that model the health risks of limited contact water recreation.
The most recent version of USEPA’s Exposure Factor Handbook (USEPA, 2009), available in draft form, does not address
the volume of water ingested during recreational activities
other than swimming. The ingestion rate during swimming
was estimated by Dufour et al. (2006), who utilized cyanuric
acid (CYA), routinely added to outdoor swimming pools to
stabilize chlorine, as a tracer of swimming pool water. In this
work we report the volume of water ingested during a variety
of water recreational activities using survey research methods
and through the measurement of CYA.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Overview

Two groups of participants were enrolled in the spring and
summer of 2009. The first group of surface water participants
was enrolled in a prospective cohort study of limited contact
water recreation, the Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and Recreation Study (CHEERS). Participants in the
surface water study were recruited at Chicago area locations
including piers, harbors, and beaches of Lake Michigan; the
Chicago area waterways system (CAWS); several inland lakes;
and rivers (excluding the CAWS). Most of the flow in the CAWS
is wastewater effluent that has undergone secondary treatment (activated sludge with aeration) but has not been disinfected. A second study group of participants was enrolled
into the swimming pool study at participating outdoor public
pools. Participants in both studies (surface water and

2021

swimming pool) completed post-recreation interviews that
addressed water ingestion during recreation. Those in the
swimming pool study collected urine samples for 24 h
following recreation, to be analyzed for CYA. The surface
water study was an observational design; the swimming pool
study was a controlled exposure design.

2.2.

Participants

Data analysis was limited to those age six years or greater. In
the swimming pool study, people who had used a swimming
pool in the prior four days were excluded, as were those with
underlying renal disease, which may influence the elimination half-life of CYA.

2.3.

Recreational activities

Surface water study participants engaged in one of five
activities: canoeing, fishing, kayaking, motor boating, or
rowing. There were no constraints on the duration of recreation for the surface waters group. Swimming pool participants engaged in canoeing, kayaking, simulated fishing,
wading/splashing, head immersion, or swimming. Head
immersion involved standing in the water and immersing
one’s head three times over a 10 min interval. The duration of
all other swimming pool activities was 60 min. Canoes and
kayaks were placed in a large swimming pool, and participants were asked to paddle around the pool. During specific
study sessions, canoe and kayak instructors were present so
that interested participants could practice “rolling” to recover
from capsize. Additionally, capsize occurred accidentally
and, at times, teenagers and young adults intentionally
capsized each other’s kayaks. Simulated fishing involved
casting a fishing rod with a toy fish on a plastic hook, reeling
in the toy fish, removing it from the hook, replacing it, and
repeating the procedure every 5 min. Wading/splashing took
place in shallow swimming pools (“splash pools”), some of
which had fountains. Participants were instructed to walk
around, play, or splash in the water, but not to swim.
Swimming took place in large swimming pools and, like the
study by Dufour et al. (2006), was limited to lap swimming. In
the surface waters study, participants were recruited at boat
launches, piers, harbors and, in the case of sea kayakers, at
beaches. Neither the choice of recreational activity nor the
duration of recreation was assigned to surface waters
participants.

2.4.

Data collection

Following recreational activity, participants in the surface
water and swimming pool studies were interviewed about
water ingestion. Those who reported water ingestion were
asked whether they swallowed “a drop or two”, “a teaspoon”,
or “one or more mouthfuls”. All interviews were conducted
using computer-assisted personal interview methods on
laptop computers running BLAISE software (Westat, Inc). The
programming of the questionnaires and the consolidation of
survey datasets were performed by the UIC Survey Research
Laboratory. Following their field interview, participants were
given 2 L amber bottles and instructed to collect their urine for

the next 24 h. Upon completion of urine collection, urine
samples were transferred from participants’ homes to the UIC
laboratory by a courier service.

2.5.

Measurement of CYA

Previously described methods for measuring CYA in swimming pool water by Cantu et al. (2001a, 2001b) and in urine by
Patel and Jones (2007) were the basis for a series of method
optimization studies. The method optimization studies and
a detailed description of the CYA analysis methods are
provided in the Supplementary material. Briefly, Chem-Elut
cartridges and the solvent MTBE were used in urine sample
preparation. The major analytical instrument was an Agilent
Model 1100 HPLC system equipped with a vacuum degasser,
a quaternary pump, a thermostated column compartment
and a diode-array UV detector. A porous graphite carbon (PGC)
column, 110 mm  3.0 mm, 5 mm particle size (Hypercarb,
Thermo-Fisher) was used. The HPLC was operated in an isocratic mode with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The wavelength of
the UV detector was set at 213 nm.
A subset of urine samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), with
the intention of confirming the results obtained using the
HPLC/DAD method. The procedure of urine sample pretreatment for LC/MS/MS analysis is similar to that described above
for HPLC/DAD, except that 100 ng/mL 13C3 15N3 labeled CYA
was spiked in each urine sample as the first step. The Waters
MicroMass Quattro LCZ LC/MS/MS system equipped with
a SeQuant ZIC HILIC column (2.1  150 mm PEEK, 5 micron)
was used. The operational conditions were developed based
on those previously reported by Smoker and Krynitsky (2008).
For each sample, a 20 mL full-loop injection was made at 8 mL/
min. The electron spray ionization MS was operated in negative mode with multiple reaction mechanism (MRM). The
native CYA was monitored with primary transition m/z
128/42 and secondary transition m/z 128/85. The labeled
CYA was monitored with transition m/z 134/44. Quantitation
of CYA was based on integrated peak area of the primary
transition.

Statistical methods

Individuals were permitted to participate in the study more
than once, but not within four days of prior participation. For
those who participated more than once it was necessary to
determine whether each round of participation could be
considered an independent event. If repeat participation
events were independent, relatively simple statistical methods
such as logistic regression would be used. If, on the other hand,
repeat participation events were not independent, mixedeffects regression models would be necessary to account for
correlations between repeated events of individuals.
The SAS NLMIXED procedure (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was
used to evaluate the independence of repeated measurements
within individuals. In this analysis we employed logistic (for
dichotomous and ordinal outcomes) and linear regression
models with a random individual effect. A variance parameter
for the random individual effect was estimated to account for
the covariance between repeated measurements from the
same individual. A likelihood ratio test on the significance of
this individual variation parameter reveals whether repeated
events from the same participant can be assumed to be
independent. The outcomes of interest included (1) any selfreported water ingestion (vs. none), (2) the estimated volume
of water ingested reported (four ordinal categories), and (3) the
calculated volume of ingestion based on results of CYA
measurement. Age, gender, recreational activity, and the time
of enrollment were included as fixed-effect covariates for all
models. For the dichotomous outcome (any water ingestion),
model selection was performed using likelihood ratio tests to
compare between a random-intercept logistic model and
random-trend logistic model. For ordinal outcomes (estimated
volume of water ingested), the proportional odds assumption
was checked by the likelihood ratio test. If the proportional
odds assumption was shown to be violated, non-proportional
odds ordinal logistic model would be compared to nonproportional odds ordinal logistic model with random intercepts to check whether significant correlations existed
between repeated measurements. For the continuous
outcome, volume of water ingested, log transformation was
performed first to normalize the data. Likelihood ratio tests
were employed to choose between mixed-effects regression
models with different random effects covariates (random
intercept vs. random-trend), as well as appropriate error
variance-covariance structures. Model fits were evaluated
using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Using the selected model with best fit,
Wald tests of the random-effect parameters were performed to
evaluate independence of the repeated measurements.

Urine CYA conc:ðmg=mLÞ  Urine VolumeðmLÞ
Pool CYA conc:ðmg=mLÞ

If less than 20% of the expected 24-urine output was
provided, the urine sample volume was considered insufficient. These thresholds for sufficient volume were 150 mL for
those age 10 and younger, 200 mL for those age 11e16, and
300 mL for those age 17 and older based on estimates of urine
volume being 60% of daily weight-based fluid requirements
(Greenbaum, 2007).

Translation factors: As described in the “Results” section,
reliable measures of cyanuric acid were only available for
a subset of urine samples. Using the calculated ingestion
volumes from those samples, as well as the self-reported
ingestion estimates from the participants who provided those
samples, translation factors were calculated. Two types of
translation factors were calculated. The mean estimate was

the mean calculated volume of water ingested for a given level
of self-reported ingestion. For each level of self-reported
ingestion an upper confidence estimate was calculated as:
Upper confidence estimate ¼ Mean estimate
þ ð1:96Þðstandard deviationÞ:
Logistic regression models were used to evaluate variables
associated with dichotomous categories of water ingestion.
The three outcomes (evaluated in three separate models)
were (1) any water ingestion (vs. none), (2) a teaspoon or
more ingested (vs. none or a drop), and (3) a mouthful or
more ingested (vs. none, a drop, or a teaspoon). Multivariate
models included gender and age category (less than age 18
years vs. 18 years or more) as predictor variables. For
recreational activities that took place in both the swimming
pool study and the surface water study, models included
a variable to evaluate whether estimates of ingestion were
different in the pool than in the surface water study. For
surface water study participants, water ingestion was also
evaluated as a function of whether recreation took place in
the CAWS vs. other area waters. All data analyses were
conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Results

3.1.

Study participants

Of the 662 swimming pool study participants, 410 (62%)
participated more than once; 9% participated four or more
times. An analysis of random effects in models of survey and
CYA-based estimates of water ingestion determined that the
covariance of observations from same individual are not
significant, and hence, each repeated event from the same
participant can be considered independent. Only 6% of
participants in the surface water study enrolled more than
once, too infrequent for within-individual covariance to be
a concern. Therefore the 3367 sets of water ingestion data
were treated as though they came from 3367 different individuals. Subject demographics and recreational activities are
summarized in Table 1. A comparable proportion of participants were children in the surface water and swimming pool
studies.

3.2.

Self-reported water ingestion

Self-reported water ingestion is summarized in Table 2, by
recreational activity and study setting, as frequencies, and as
relative frequencies. Pool study fishers and participants who
walked around the swimming pool reported no water ingestion. No more than 5% of participants in any given activity on
surface waters reported ingesting water. Those who canoed
and kayaked in swimming pools tended to report water
ingestion more frequently than those who engaged in these
same activities in surface waters. Swimmers more frequently
reported water ingestion than those who performed head
immersion.

3.3.

Predictors of self-reported water ingestion

Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify
and evaluate predictors of ingesting a teaspoon or more of
water, by self-report among surface water recreators (Table 3).
After adjusting for activity and age category, males tended to
report water ingestion more frequently than females. Age
category was not associated with self-reported water ingestion. The odds of ingesting a teaspoon or more of water were
substantially higher among swimmers than among those who
performed head immersion (in the pool study) or limitedcontact activities on surface waters. Odds ratios and confidence intervals similar to those reported in Table 3 were noted
for swallowing any water and for swallowing at least
a mouthful of water (data not presented).
Capsizing occurred among 41/766 (5.4%) surface water and
21/76 (27.6%) of swimming pool canoers. Capsizing occurred
among 27/801 (3.4%) surface water and 40/104 (38.5%) swimming pool kayakers. One of 222 surface water rowers (0.5%)
reported capsizing as well. Swallowing water among canoers,
kayakers, and rowers was evaluated using a multivariate
logistic model with capsizing, age category, gender, activity,
and study setting (CAWS vs. other surface waters). The only
significant predictor of water ingestion was capsizing.
Compared to those who did not capsize, the odds (95% CI) of
ingesting any, a teaspoon or more, or a mouthful or more
among those who did capsize were 4.83 (2.42, 9.64), 24.57 (9.32,
64.75), and 247.22 (17.45, 3501.85), respectively.

Given the strong association between capsizing and
ingesting water, a logistic regression model was run to identify predictors of capsizing. The only significant predicator
was that capsizing was much more likely to occur on general
use waters compared to CAWS, as presented in Table 4.

3.4.

CYA in pool water and urine samples

A total of 130 pool water samples were analyzed using the
HPLC/DAD method. As detailed in the Supplementary
material, quality-monitoring data indicate excellent performance of the method for pool samples. Urine samples were
collected from 665 of the 685 study participants (97.1%).
Excellent agreement between self-reported water ingestion
and the estimates obtained from CYA measurement using
LC/MS/MS was observed for the subset (N ¼ 27) of the urine
samples collected from participants who enrolled in the study
on four dates in July, 2009. These participants used a total of
four pools, and represented five of the six recreational activities (none fished). The mean age of these participants was
comparable to those whose samples were not analyzed by MS
(34.8 vs. 34.3 years, p ¼ 0.85). The means  standard deviations
are 1.4  0.8, 9.4  11.0, and 26  37 mL for the participant
groups with self-reported injection volumes of none, drop to
teaspoon, and mouthful, respectively, showing strong agreement between the self-reported results and those based on
CYA measurement using LC/MS/MS. However, quality control
data for HPLC/DAD analysis indicated a strong matrix effect,
particularly when the CYA concentration level in the swimming pool water was low. The correlation between CYA
concentrations measured by the two instrument systems was
very poor (r2 ¼ 0.1). In addition, the estimates of ingestion

Translation factors for self-reported water ingestion

Among participants whose urine samples were analyzed by
LC/MS/MS, because few reported swallowing a drop or
a teaspoon of water, these two categories were collapsed into
a single category. Log10-transformed values of MS-based
calculations of ingestion were associated with the ordinal
levels of self-reported ingestion (none, drop-teaspoon,
mouthful), with an r2 of 0.24, p ¼ 0.009. Table 5 summarizes
the values of calculated ingestion for each level of selfreported ingestion.
The translation factors (Table 5) were used to estimate the
volume of water ingested for recreational activities. The
absolute estimated ingestion volumes for the mean and upper
confidence level by activity are summarized in Table 6. The
table also summarizes the mean ingestion volume relative to
that observed during surface water fishing and rowing.
Generally, the mean estimates are about 50% greater than the
median estimates. This occurs because the distribution of
mean ingestion volumes is skewed in a positive direction,
with most of the values found near the minimum value
(0.3 mL, corresponding to “no water ingestion” in Table 5),
consistent with a lognormal distribution. Three categories of
recreational activities are apparent based on ingestion

estimates for the 95th percentile (the upper confidence limit).
The low ingestion category is comprised of rowing, motor
boating, fishing, wading/splashing, and non-capsizing
kayaking and canoeing. These activities have an upper confidence estimate of about 10e12 mL/h. Those who capsized
during canoeing or kayaking comprise a middle ingestion
category, with an upper confidence limit estimate of about
17e20 mL/h. Swimmers were the high ingestion category,
with an estimated upper confidence estimate of ingesting
about 35 mL/h.

Discussion

In this first study designed to evaluate water ingestion during
limited-contact recreational activities, less than 5% of limitedcontact recreators on surface waters reported swallowing any
water, compared to more than 50% of swimmers in a pool.
Compared to those who canoed or kayaked in a swimming
pool, swimmers in a pool were about four to seven times more
likely to report swallowing at least a teaspoon of water.
Compared to those who canoed or kayaked on surface waters,
swimmers in a pool were more than 50 times as likely to
report swallowing a teaspoon of water. Because the vast
majority of limited-contact recreators on surface waters
denied swallowing any water, less dramatic differences were
observed in the estimated mean volume of water ingested:
canoeing, 3.9 mL; fishing 3.6 mL; kayaking, 3.8 mL; motor
boating, 3.7 mL; and rowing 3.9 mL. These are all about

35e40% of the 10.0 mL estimated to occur during swimming in
a pool. The mean volume of water ingested during canoeing or
kayaking among those who capsized was about 60% higher
than among those who did not capsize. Canoers and kayakers
were about 5e10 times more likely to capsize in a swimming
pool than on surface waters. These observations may have
been due to a perception of safety in a pool with lifeguards and
kayaking instructors in attendance. Among surface waters,
study participants, capsizing was nine times more common
on general use waters than on the CAWS. Again, this may
have been due to the recognition of unique physical hazards
and the presence of wastewater at the CAWS, which are
communicated to the public at CAWS boat launches via posted signs. The fact that capsizing is less common on the CAWS
suggests that efforts to communicate health and safety
hazards to the public have resulted in risk reduction. Work by
Fleisher and Kay (2006) suggests that risk perception influences the occurrence of self-reported gastrointestinal illness;
our findings suggest that this may occur despite the ingestion
of smaller volumes of water. The LC/MS/MS method resulted
in calculated volumes of ingestion that were consistent with
self-reported data, supporting the validity of the survey
instrument for evaluating water ingestion.

4.1.

Significance of the results

QMRA analyses are probabilistic, utilizing a distribution of
values for each of the following key inputs: (1) the volume of
water ingested during recreation, (2) the density of microbes
in the water, (3) the relationship between the dose of microbes
ingested and probability of illness. The volume of water
ingested can be calculated as a function of the rate of ingestion (volume per unit time) and the duration of recreation. As
a consequence of this research, estimates of water ingestion
during a variety of water recreational activities are now
available, which should reduce the uncertainty in quantitative
estimates of health risk due to water recreation. The
measurement of CYA in urine (but not in swimming pool
water) was problematic using HPLC/DAD, and future efforts to
quantify CYA in urine should rely on LC/MS/MS.
Several epidemiologic studies have identified associations
between self-reported water exposure during full-contact
water recreation and the development of illness. Exposure has
previously been categorized based on the occurrence of head
immersion (Seyfried et al., 1985; McBride et al., 1998; Wade
et al., 2006) or body immersion (Wade et al., 2008). A study of
windsurfers evaluated the influence of the number of times
participants fell into the water (Dewailly et al., 1986). Other
studies analyzed the occurrence of illness as function of selfreported
water
ingestion
for
controlled
exposure
(Wiedenmann et al., 2006) and for observational studies of
limited-contact (Fewtrell et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1997) and fullcontact (Colford et al., 2007) recreation. In general, health risks
are higher in association with increased exposure, though not
for all outcomes and not for all definitions of exposure.
Two broad categories of study designs - randomized trials
of controlled exposure and observational studies - have been
employed to evaluate the health risks of water recreation. It
has not been possible to directly compare results of the two
approaches because of differences in the definition of

exposure used in each of the approaches. In the randomized
trials exposure has been defined as three head immersions
during a 10-min interval (Kay et al., 1994; Wiedenmann et al.,
2006; Fleisher et al., 2010). In the observational studies (USEPA,
1983, 1984; Wade et al., 2006, 2008) exposure was not determined by the investigators, but rather, participants swam or
played in the water for as long and in whatever ways they
chose. We found that head immersion results in about half the
mean volume of ingestion and about 1/5th the likelihood of
swallowing at least a teaspoon of water compared to swimming. This information should be useful in synthesizing the
findings generated by the two study designs. It should be
noted, however, that we evaluated head immersion in
a swimming pool while the other studies evaluated immersion in surface water. It is possible that those in swimming
pool may have perceived a lesser risk of ingesting pool water
and may not have avoided water ingestion as they may have
in surface waters, particularly in marine waters.
Our findings of relative rates of water ingestion (as mL/
hour or percent that swallow a teaspoon or more) are likely
more meaningful than the absolute estimates of ingestion.
The mean estimate of water ingestion during limited-contact
recreation is about one third of that during swimming (in
a pool). Given the mean volume ingestion during swimming
relative to limited-contact recreation, rates of illness attributable to limited-contact activities should be about one third
of that reported during swimming on the same water,
assuming a linear relationship between ingested pathogen
dose and illness risk. The fact that self-reported ingestion of
a teaspoon or more of water is relatively uncommon (less than
5% of surface water limited-contact recreators) suggests that
a small percentage of recreators constitute an at-risk group.
We found that capsizing is a strong determinant of ingestion,
and should be discouraged in water where water quality is
relatively poor. While studies of water recreation have
generally focused on infectious hazards, health risk assessments for chemical exposure during water recreation have
also been reported (Hussain et al., 1998; Dor et al., 2003). The
findings of the present study may also be useful in risk
assessments of recreational exposure to mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and of recent interest, oil dispersants.

4.2.

Our findings in context

Two prior studies have attempted to quantify the volume of
water ingested during water recreation. Water ingestion
among surfers on the Oregon coast was investigated by Stone
et al. (2008). In that study participants were also asked to
estimate the volume of water swallowed while surfing with
response options of a few drops, 1e3 teaspoons, the amount in
a shot glass (2 ounces), or the amount in a small juice glass
(4 ounces). Based on the self-reported estimates of ingestion
volume and ingestion frequency, the authors estimated
a median daily ingestion of 34.4 mL, and an arithmetic mean
of 170.6 mL. Water ingestion among swimmers was estimated
by Dufour and colleagues Dufour et al. (2006) at USEPA using
CYA as a tracer of swimming pool water. Over the course of
a 45-min swim, the 12 adults in the study swallowed an estimated 16 mL of pool water while the 41 children swallowed an
average of 37 mL. The authors followed up with a larger scale

study with involving 549 swimmers, the results of which have
been presented at a conference by Evans et al. (2006). In that
study children were found to swallow more water than adults
(47 mL vs. 24 mL), and males swallowed more than females
(37 mL vs. 27 mL), differences that were highly significant
statistically. Twenty-five percent of the swimmers swallowed
85 mL or more, and some swallowed up to 280 mL. The Dufour
estimate of 16 mL/45 min (or 21 mL/h) is intermediate between
our mean estimate of 10 mL and the upper confidence estimate of 35 mL.

Limitations

As originally designed, this research sought to generate
a calculated volume of water ingestion for each participant,
using HPLC measures of CYA in pool water and urine samples.
We did not rely on the HPLC measures of CYA in urine because
of their limited precision and the frequency of false positives
and false negatives. We based our estimates of ingestion
volume on the 27 (5%) of participants who provided selfreported estimates of ingestion, as well as urine samples
measured by LC/MS. Because that subset of participants
was relatively small, the point estimates of the translation
factors (Table 5) are limited in their precision. Additionally,
because of the small number of participants whose urine
samples were analyzed with the gold standard method, we
were unable to generate adult-specific and child-specific
volumes of ingestion (based on CYA measures) for each level
of self-reported ingestion. Another limitation is that the
highest category of self-reported water ingestion was “a
mouthful or more”. Some participants who reported this level
of ingestion may have ingested “a mouthful” while others
ingested more than that. The collection of more detailed data
about the number of mouthfuls ingested may have generated
better agreement between self-reported and CYA-based estimates of ingestion. Because <1% of surface water participants
reported ingesting “a mouthful or more” any improvement in
categorizing ingestion among that small subset would have
minimal impact on the overall findings. Again, because of the
relatively small number of participants for whom high quality
urine CYA data was available, we were unable to compare the
volume of water ingested by adults and by children. Future
research could focus on this question. Although it is not
known how representative study participants were of surface
water recreators in general, there is no reason to believe that
participants systematically over- or under-estimated the
volume of water that they ingested.

5.

Conclusions

The mean volume of water ingested during limited-contact
recreation activities, about 3.5e4 mL is about 35e40% of that
observed during swimming (about 10 mL). The frequency of
swallowing at least teaspoon of water during limited-contact
recreation (about 1% of study participants) is about 1/50th the
frequency observed during swimming in a pool (51% of
participants). In surface waters with high concentrations of
chemical or microbial hazards, avoiding capsizing should
significantly reduce the percentage of paddlers who swallow

2027

a teaspoon or more of water. LC/MS/MS is preferred over HPLC
for analyzing CYA in urine samples.
