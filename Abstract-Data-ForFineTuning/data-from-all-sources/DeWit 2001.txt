Gastroenteritis is one of the most common diseases
throughout the world (1, 2). In industrialized countries, such
as the Netherlands, the associated mortality is low, but morbidity remains high. Most episodes of gastroenteritis are
brief and do not require medical attention, but the social and
economic burdens are substantial because of the high incidence. With a few exceptions (3–5), studies estimating the
incidence and burden of disease of gastroenteritis focus on
patients seen at some level of the health care system or at
certain age groups. These patients are a minority and are a

nonrandom selection of all patients. Little is known about
health care-seeking behavior, but it is likely that the severity
and duration of symptoms play a role. Because these factors
are also related to the pathogen causing the symptoms, the
relative importance of the various pathogens will differ
between patients who seek medical advice and those who do
not. To estimate the incidence and disease burden of gastroenteritis at the population level, to study the causative
pathogens and the selection of patients consulting a general
practitioner, and to identify transmission modes, two studies
were performed. A population-based cohort study (Sensor)
was performed in combination with a study among cases
presenting to general practitioners (6, 7). This paper
describes the population-based study estimating the incidence of gastroenteritis in the general population and the
causative pathogens in different age groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design

The study was designed as a prospective, populationbased cohort study with a nested case-control study. To
include an entire year in the study, two consecutive cohorts
of 6 months were included from December 14, 1998 to June
13, 1999 and from June 14 to December 13, 1999. An agestratified random sample was drawn from all persons registered at the participating sentinel general practices from the
Netherlands Institute of Primary Health Care (8). Of the 44

A prospective population-based cohort study with a nested case-control study was conducted to estimate the
incidence of gastroenteritis and the associated pathogens in the general Dutch population. Follow-up of two
consecutive cohorts was performed by weekly reporting cards from December 1998 to December 1999. Cases
and controls in the case-control study supplied a questionnaire and stool samples. The standardized
gastroenteritis incidence was 283 per 1,000 person-years. The incidence rose with increasing level of education
and was higher for persons with a history of diarrhea and for young children. Bacterial pathogens accounted for
5% of cases, bacterial toxins for 9%, parasites for 6%, and viral pathogens for 21%, with Norwalk-like virus (NLV)
as the leading pathogen in 11% of cases. The gastroenteritis incidence was higher than that reported for
England, but lower than for the United States. In community cases, viral pathogens are the leading cause of
gastroenteritis, with NLV being the number one cause of illness in all age groups but one. In many countries,
preventive measures are implemented to decrease bacterial infections. However, additional prevention of viral
infections, especially NLV, might significantly decrease the number of gastroenteritis cases in the community. Am

A Population-based Study on Gastroenteritis

Laboratory methods

Stool samples were sent by regular mail to the National
Institute of Public Health and the Environment and consisted of a nonfixated sample and a sample fixated in
sodium acetate, acetic acid, and formalin (1.6 percent) (9).
Stool samples were tested for pathogenic bacteria, viruses,
parasites, and bacterial toxins. The presence of pathogenic
bacteria was assayed by routine culture assays on selective
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 7, 2001

media, combined with polymerase chain reaction for detection of the Escherichia coli virulence-associated genes.
Rotavirus group A, adenovirus type 40/41, and astrovirus
were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (7).
Sapporo-like virus (SLV) and Norwalk-like virus (NLV)
were assayed by a newly developed reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (10, 11). The presence
of parasites was studied by microscopic examination of
four different preparations of fixated samples. A more
detailed description of these methods is given elsewhere
(7). A random set of first samples of cases and controls
were also tested for Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus
species, for enterotoxins A, B, C, and D of Staphylococcus
aureus, and for enterotoxin of Clostridium perfringens. The
presence of enterotoxins of S. aureus and C. perfringens
was assayed with a detection kit by reversed passive latex
agglutination (SET-RPLA for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C, and D in food samples or culture
filtrates and PET-RPLA for the detection of C. perfringens
enterotoxins in fecal samples or culture filtrates; Oxoid,
Basingstoke, United Kingdom). A sample was considered
positive for enterotoxin of S. aureus if any 1:10 (or higher)
dilution with the latex sensitized with antienterotoxin A to
D showed an agglutination as described by the manufacturer and the corresponding dilution with control latex did
not show an agglutination. A sample was considered positive for enterotoxin of C. perfringens if any 1:10 (or higher)
dilution with the latex sensitized with antienterotoxin
showed an agglutination as described by the manufacturer,
if the corresponding dilution with control latex did not
show an agglutination, and if no inhibitive effect of a dilution series of the feces was shown on a known concentration of C. perfringens enterotoxin. B. cereus and Bacillus
species were cultured on mannitol egg yolk polymixin agar
according to International Organization for Standardization
document 7932:1993. Specific colonies for B. cereus or
Bacillus species were isolated and confirmed for B. cereus
or Bacillus species by identification of fatty acid composition. A sample was considered positive for B. cereus or
Bacillus species if a confirmed colony was isolated in
1:1000 dilution. All stool samples were stored for future
investigations at 4˚C and –70˚C.
Statistical analyses

The representativeness of participants was estimated by a
comparison with nonparticipants and with the Dutch population if data were available (12). The degree of urbanization
was categorized by addresses per km2 as “very high”
(>2,500), “high” (1,500–2,500), “moderate” (1,000–1,500),
“low” (500–1,000), and “none” (<500). In the classification of
degree of urbanization in the Netherlands Institute of Primary
Health Care network, the categories high, moderate, and low
were grouped as “urbanized.” The highest educational level
achieved by those aged 18 years and older and by one of the
parents for those aged 0–17 years was classified as low (primary school, lower vocational or lower general secondary
education), intermediate (intermediate vocational or intermediate general secondary and higher general secondary educa-

practices in the network, 27 practices participated in the first
cohort and 31 in the second. The age groups used for stratification were 0, 1–4, 5–11, 12–64, and 65 years and older.
The number of invited persons was based on an expected
response rate of 35 percent and a power calculation for estimating age group-specific incidences with a precision of 10
percent and estimating the overall ratio of community versus consulting cases with a precision of 20 percent. Persons
were invited by mail, and after 3 weeks, a reminder was sent
to nonrespondents. The reply card included five questions
for nonparticipants concerning the reason for nonparticipation, level of education, country of birth, and diarrhea or
vomiting in the previous 2 months. All participants signed
an informed consent. The study was approved by the
Medical Ethical Committee of the Institute for Applied
Scientific Research, TNO, Zeist, the Netherlands.
At the start of follow-up, all participants were asked to
complete a baseline questionnaire. During follow-up, participants sent in a card weekly, reporting the presence or
absence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the previous week.
For weeks spent abroad, no reporting of symptoms was
requested.
All participants were instructed at the beginning of the
study to contact the study coordinator by telephone if they
developed symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting. In addition, a
stool sample had to be collected immediately. The study
coordinator checked whether the case definition of gastroenteritis was met, i.e., at least three loose stools in 24
hours or vomiting at least three times in 24 hours or diarrhea
with two or more additional symptoms or vomiting with two
or more additional symptoms in 24 hours. The additional
symptoms could be diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps,
abdominal pain, fever, nausea, blood in the stool, or mucus
in the stool. If there was an obvious noninfectious cause, the
case was excluded. If symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting
were reported only on weekly cards, the participant was
contacted by telephone. For each case, a control was invited
from the cohort, matched on age, degree of urbanization,
and region. Participants were invited as a control only once
in the study period. After a case episode, a 2-week symptom-free period was taken into account before a participant
could become a control or a case again. Cases and controls
completed a questionnaire about risk factors and submitted
stool samples (cases: four samples: days 0, 7, 14, and 21
after onset of disease; controls: days 0 and 7 after inclusion
as a control). Cases also completed a medical diary for 4
weeks, reporting daily about gastrointestinal symptoms, bed
rest, absence from work or school, use of medication, and
use of the health care system.

RESULTS
Participation and representativeness of the cohort

In total, 11,569 persons were invited, and 4,860 persons
(42 percent) participated (figure 1). Participation was

highest in the age groups up to 11 years (54 percent) and
decreased with age (28 percent for ages 65 years and
older). Participation was lower in the two most urbanized
categories (28 and 40 percent) and in the western region
of the country (33 percent). Of the 2,503 nonparticipants
who supplied information on the reason for nonresponse,
154 persons (6 percent) responded that they never or
hardly ever suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms. In
accordance, persons who reported diarrhea in the 2
months prior to the beginning of the study were overrepresented (13.3 vs. 9.6 percent). In addition, persons born
outside the Netherlands were underrepresented (2.4 vs.
7.5 percent) as were persons with a lower educational
level (32.0 vs. 40.8 percent). In general, these differences
between participants and nonparticipants were relatively
small.
In comparison with the Dutch population, persons born
outside the Netherlands were underrepresented (2 percent in
the cohort and 10 percent in the Dutch population), as were
persons with an intermediate educational level (35 vs. 54
percent). The western region of the country was underrepresented in the study (23 vs. 45 percent), as were areas with a
very high and an intermediate degree of urbanization (10 vs.
19 percent and 13 vs. 21 percent).
Information was supplied for 121,682 person-weeks
(2,340 person-years) of the possible maximum of 126,360
person-weeks (96 percent). Of these, 2,077 person-weeks
(1.7 percent) were spent abroad. Of all participants, 99 percent supplied information for 23 weeks or more, and 76
percent supplied information for all 26 weeks. A total of 97
persons dropped out of the study. The most important reasons for loss to follow-up were switching to a nonparticipating general practitioner or a change in personal situation that made participation no longer feasible (e.g.,
hospitalization, new job).

tion), and high (higher vocational secondary education and
university education). A multivariate logistic regression
model was used to estimate the independent associations with
response. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Contribution to the model was based on the likelihood ratio parameter.
The total number of cases included participants in the casecontrol study and additional cases identified from weekly
cards only. For the calculation of person-years at risk, weeks
for which no weekly card was received, weeks abroad, and
weeks included in a gastroenteritis episode or in the two
symptom-free weeks afterwards were excluded. For extrapolation to the general population, the incidence was standardized by age, gender, and cohort according to the distribution
in the Dutch population in 1999 (12). Poisson regression
analyses were used to estimate the independent effects of
demographic variables on the incidence. Age, gender, and
cohort were included in the final multivariate model, irrespective of their contribution to the fit. For other variables, a
p value of 0.05 was considered significant, and contribution
to the model was based on the deviance estimate.
The first stool samples of cases and controls were used to
study the presence of pathogens. Because of insufficient
quantity of the first stool samples, the results for the bacterial tests for 88 cases and 29 controls were based on the second stool sample. Dientamoeba fragilis was considered a
potentially pathogenic parasite, but was not included in the
total of pathogens.



A Population-based Study on Gastroenteritis
Incidence

A total of 1,050 case episodes occurred during the followup period: 718 persons had one episode of gastroenteritis,
129 had two, 18 had three, and five had four.
The overall incidence standardized by age, gender, and
cohort was 283 per 1,000 person-years (table 1). The incidence was slightly higher in the first cohort and was much
higher in children aged 0–11 years compared with the older
age groups. The peak was found in children aged 1–4 years.
Furthermore, the incidence increased with educational level
and was higher for persons who reported diarrhea in the 2
months prior to follow-up. The standardized incidence was
the highest in January 1999 (figure 2). A second peak was
observed in June 1999.

ilar pattern was observed for adenovirus. Rotavirus was
most frequent in the children younger than 1 year.
Surprisingly, the proportion of rotavirus in adults and the
elderly was similar to that in those aged 1–4 years.
Astrovirus was detected mainly in the youngest age groups,
but increased for those aged 0 to 5–11 years. In the age group
1–4 years and, to a lesser extent, the age group 5–11 years,
G. lamblia was also common. Cryptosporidium was more
restricted to the age group 1–4 years. S. aureus toxins were
common in most age groups, with the exception of the adolescents and the elderly. C. perfringens toxin was detected
mostly in the age groups 12 years and older, with the highest percentage in those aged 12–17 years. The age distributions of the different pathogens in controls was similar to
those in cases (not shown).
A pathogen was found in about half of the age groups up
to age 11 years. The lowest percentage was found in those
aged 12–17 years. The proportion of cases with D. fragilis
increased up to age 5–11 years and decreased in the older
age groups. The age distribution of pathogens that were
detected in fewer than six cases was not presented in table 3
because the numbers per age group were too small to allow
conclusions.
DISCUSSION
Response and incidence

This is one of the few population-based prospective studies on gastroenteritis in the world. A unique feature of our
study was that we tested a broad panel of microorganisms by
using recently developed techniques for some pathogens. In
addition to a prospectively measured incidence rate, the
results provide rarely available data on the relative importance of the various pathogens in all age groups throughout
the community. This order of importance probably reflects
the pattern in many industrialized countries and thus may be
valuable for setting public health priorities for the control of
gastroenteritis in these countries.
The standardized overall incidence of gastroenteritis in
the Netherlands was 283 per 1,000 person-years, a lower
estimate than that of 447 per 1,000 person-years found in a
population-based study in the Netherlands in 1991 (13).
Although it may reflect an actual decrease over this decade,
it is more likely that the incidence in 1991 was overestimated, since response seemed strongly influenced by gastrointestinal symptoms. A comparable study in England over
the period 1993–1995 reported an incidence of 190 per
1,000 person-years, which is significantly lower (14). Our
case definition was stricter than that used in England (loose
stools or significant vomiting), and therefore, the higher
incidence cannot be explained by the difference in case definition. Furthermore, the percentage in which a pathogen
was detected was similar in our study (46 percent) and in the
English study (45 percent), and therefore, the difference in
incidence cannot be explained by the inclusion of a larger
proportion of noninfectious gastroenteritis (15). Since the
methodologies of both studies were comparable, it is likely
that the incidence in the Netherlands is indeed higher than
that in England. For the United States, a much higher esti-

Overall, 73 percent of eligible cases participated in the
case-control component. Cases from the older age groups
participated less than did those from the younger age
groups, with the lowest participation in the adolescents
(12–17 years). Of the invited controls, 90 percent participated (765 of 851).
A total of 713 cases and 684 controls submitted at least
one stool sample. Of the first samples of cases, 68 percent
were collected within 1 day after the onset of symptoms
(maximum, 23 days after), and 98 percent were collected
within 1 week after the onset.
Overall, in 46 percent of cases (standardized, 36 percent),
a pathogen was detected (excluding D. fragilis, Blastocystis
hominis, B. cereus, and other Bacillus species) (table 2).
Viruses were the leading cause of gastroenteritis in cases,
with NLV as the predominant one, followed by rotavirus and
SLV. Viral agents were also detected in 0.6–5.2 percent of
the controls. Bacteria were found in low percentages in
cases, with Campylobacter as the most prominent one.
Because young children were overrepresented, after standardization for age, the proportion of cases attributable to
viruses was lower and that attributed to bacteria was higher.
Bacterial agents were hardly present in controls. Analysis of
only stool samples that were received within 4 days after the
onset of symptoms had only a minor impact on the percentages positive for bacteria. Giardia lamblia was also a frequently detected pathogen in cases, but was detected in a
similar percentage of controls. Bacterial toxins were
detected in 8 percent of the cases, and in 5 percent, it was
detected as the only cause of gastroenteritis, as well as in a
substantial proportion of controls. Of the samples of cases
that were tested for all pathogens, in 8 percent (23 of 291
samples), more than one pathogen was detected. In total,
only 2 percent of cases reported use of antibiotics in the
week before the onset of symptoms.
For all age groups, NLV was the most frequent pathogen,
with the exception of those aged 18–64 years, in which S.
aureus was slightly more frequent and NLV was relatively
low (table 3). In contrast, SLV was mostly observed in the
three youngest age groups, with a decreasing frequency for
those aged less than 1 year to those aged 5–11 years. A sim-

mate of 790 per 1,000 person-years was recently reported
(16). However, this rate is based mainly on retrospective
self-reported symptoms, which are known to yield overestimates of the real incidence (14).

In our study, persons reporting diarrhea prior to the follow-up period were slightly overrepresented, and those with
an intermediate educational level were underrepresented.
However, the effect of these biases is very small: Correction

for the educational level increased the incidence by 5 percent; correction for the overrepresentation of persons with
diarrhea in the previous 2 months decreased the incidence
with only 2 percent. The effect of the underrepresentation of
persons born abroad, who tended to have a higher incidence,
could not be estimated because no valid estimate of the incidence could be obtained for this small subgroup. To examine this specific group, a separate study would be needed
with special focus on language problems and cultural barriers. The incidence might be underestimated because of
underreporting of symptoms with increasing duration of
follow-up; the incidence was higher at the beginning of the
follow-up period for both cohorts. However, these peaks
also coincided with the winter peak and the summer peak,
known from other sources to occur in these weeks (17, 18).
In general, we believe that our standardized estimate of the
incidence of gastroenteritis is valid.
A higher incidence was found for persons with a higher
educational level. In contrast, in developing countries,
negative associations between educational level and incidence of diarrhea have been reported (19–21). This is
mostly explained by a better knowledge of the concepts of
hygiene and access to proper sanitation for the highly educated population. This explanation seems to be relevant for
countries where the socioeconomic differences are large.
However, in the Netherlands, socioeconomic differences
are relatively small. The risk for the highly educated persons in our country might be associated with a higher
income, resulting in more money to spend on, for instance,
travel, eating in restaurants, and high-risk exotic foods. In
addition, a study in the United States showed that risk
behavior for foodborne infections, such as consumption of
raw meat, was more common among persons with a higher
education (22).

Microbiologic findings and response of cases and
controls

In general, results are based on a 1-year period. For several pathogens, especially viruses, the seasonal peaks can
differ in magnitude in different years. On the basis of laboratory surveillance data, the studied year did not seem to be
an exceptional year.
Viral pathogens were the most important causes of gastroenteritis in community cases, with the largest percentage
being attributable to NLV. This supports the finding of the
English study, although their estimate was clearly lower than
ours, probably because of the use of less sensitive electron
microscopy for detection of these viruses (10, 15). The US
estimate of 11 percent of cases attributable to NLV presented
by Mead et al. (16) was based on the preliminary estimate of
the winter season of our study (23). Bacterial pathogens were
detected only in a small proportion of cases (2 percent) (after
standardization, 5 percent). In England, the percentages
attributable to Campylobacter and Salmonella were slightly
higher than in our study, but were also secondary to viral
agents (15). For the United States, the percentage attributable
to bacterial agents was comparable with our estimate (16).
Among the parasites, G. lamblia was the most frequently
detected (in approximately 5 percent of the cases). However,
the percentage detected in controls was similar. The moment
of sampling might be relevant here: The excretion of G. lamblia often starts 1 week after the beginning of symptoms, and
first samples were collected as soon as possible after onset
(24). This influence will be studied by future comparison of
the percentage positive for G. lamblia in first and second samples. G. lamblia was more frequent in our study than in the
English study. This might be due to the exclusion of cases
with symptoms for more than 2 weeks in the English study

and to the less sensitive testing method in their study (7).
Remarkably, Cryptosporidium was also more common in our
study than in the English study, in spite of the frequent occurrence of outbreaks of Cryptosporidium in England (25–27).
Due to the early time of sampling in this study, bacterial
toxins were detected in 8 percent of the cases and contributed 5 percent to decreasing the diagnostic deficit.
However, S. aureus toxins were also detected in a similar
percentage of controls. In England as well as in the United

States, both S. aureus and C. perfringens were present in
less than 1 percent of all cases (15, 16).
The relative contributions of the different pathogens contrast sharply with results from general practitioner-based
studies (6, 15). It is likely that this difference is related to the
severity and duration of symptoms caused by the different
groups of pathogens.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to present community-based age distributions of SLV cases and to present

community-based data on NLV (and SLV) based on molecular detection methods. Since the development of RT-PCR
for the detection of NLV, this pathogen was already shown
to be the major cause of outbreaks in winter months in the
Netherlands (10). This study showed that it is also the main
pathogen in individual cases of all age groups.
While NLV was observed as the most frequent pathogen
in all age groups, SLV was mainly restricted to the youngest
age groups, with a clearly decreasing trend from those aged
0 years to those aged 5–11 years. This is consistent with
studies that show that antibodies are acquired early in life
and immunity protects the adults (28, 29). The proportion of
cases in which astroviruses were detected increased slightly
up to age 11 years, in contrast to several reviews that report
infections mainly in very young children (28, 30, 31).
Although a seroprevalence study in the Netherlands showed
that antibodies against astrovirus can be detected in almost
all persons aged 5 years and older, the proportion of cases
with astrovirus was relatively low in all age groups, suggesting that the majority of seroconversions are due to
asymptomatic infection (32). Alternatively, it is conceivable
that high numbers of positives would have been detected by
RT-PCR-based detection, as had been demonstrated in other
studies (33, 34). The added value of RT-PCR in the detection of astroviruses will be evaluated in future experiments.
Annually, 4.5 million episodes of gastroenteritis occur in
the Netherlands. For children under age 5 years, more than
half have at least one episode each year. The incidence in the
Netherlands is approximately 1.5 times as high as in
England and approximately one quarter of the less precise
estimate for the United States. Viral agents are the leading
cause of illness, with NLV as the number one pathogen in
almost all age groups. Clear differences in the relative
importance of the various pathogens were observed between
this community-based study and the general practice-based
studies. In many countries, preventive measures are implemented to decrease bacterial infections. This study shows
that prevention of viral infections, especially NLV, might
significantly decrease the number of gastroenteritis cases in
the community. However, to effectively determine intervention strategies, more information is needed on the relevant
routes of transmission of NLV.
