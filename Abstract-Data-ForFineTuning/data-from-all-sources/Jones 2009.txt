Service, Intermountain Region, Flagstaff, AZ (Mr Kramer).

Background.—Every year over 22 000 people raft the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon
in Arizona. Since 1994, over 400 rafters in 6 separate outbreaks have become ill with norovirus while
rafting this stretch of the river.
Objectives.—To assess potential causes of these outbreaks, Colorado River water, water from nearby wastewater treatment plants, and a drinking water source were sampled and tested for norovirus
and other water quality indicators.
Methods.—Colorado River water was collected and sampled during the 2004 rafting season. Water from
wastewater treatment plants near the Lee’s Ferry launch site and drinking water from the Lee’s Ferry launch
site were also examined during the 2003 and 2004 rafting seasons. Stool samples from ill rafters and
composite stool samples from onboard toilet-cans were tested for the presence of norovirus during the
2003 and 2004 outbreaks. Parameters examined included the following: norovirus by reverse transcriptase–
polymerase chain reaction, coliforms, Escherichia coli, temperature, turbidity, and pH.
Results.—No norovirus was detected in the Colorado River during the 2004 ﬁeld sampling. Norovirus was detected in the Glen Canyon Dam Wastewater Treatment Plant on one occasion in 2004.
Drinking water from the Lee’s Ferry launch site was negative for norovirus in 2003, and Colorado
River water from the Lee’s Ferry launch site was negative for norovirus in 2004. In 2003, 3 of 10
stool samples from ill rafters or onboard toilet-cans were positive for norovirus. Neither of 2 stool
samples collected in 2004 was positive for norovirus.
Conclusions.—Colorado River water tested during nonoutbreak periods was negative for norovirus,
indicating that there is not an ongoing high level of norovirus contamination in the river. No source
or sources of contamination could be identiﬁed from the testing. Potential sources of norovirus outbreaks among rafters include drinking contaminated river water, consuming contaminated foodstuff,
rafter importation of the virus and subsequent person-to-person spread, and contaminated fomites,
campsites, or equipment. It is likely outbreaks are the result of more than one source of norovirus,
and the exact source remains unknown for several outbreaks.

Introduction
Norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis
in the United States, accounting for an estimated
23 000 000 cases of gastroenteritis per year.1 The virus

is spread through the fecal-oral route as well as by aerosolized vomitus and fomite contamination and can be
transmitted by eating contaminated foods, drinking or
accidentally swallowing contaminated water, contact
with contaminated surfaces, or via close contact with an
ill person. Norovirus causes the abrupt onset of nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. The incubation time for the virus
is 12 to 48 hours, and it usually lasts 1 to 3 days, though
occasionally severe cases last longer. This virus is highly
contagious. Outbreaks are characterized by the short incubation period, high attack rate, and projectile vomit-

Table 1. Overview of outbreaks of norovirus or suspected norovirus among river rafters on the Colorado River, AZ: 1994–2005*

ing. Outbreaks among vulnerable populations such as the
elderly or inﬁrm can have devastating consequences, including death,2 while outbreaks among other populations, such as cruise ship passengers,3 are extremely unpleasant and of economic importance to businesses. In
addition to causing millions of cases of gastroenteritis,
the virus is also a public health burden and the cause of
an estimated 50 000 hospitalizations and 300 deaths per
year in the United States.1
Many people from all over the world travel to Arizona
to visit the Grand Canyon National Park, and over
22 000 people a year raft the 386-K (240-mile) stretch
of the Colorado River that ﬂows through the Grand Canyon.4 This portion of the river is downstream of Lake
Powell, a recreational lake, and the Glen Canyon Dam,
which forms Lake Powell. Consequently, all ﬂow into
the Colorado River beyond the Glen Canyon Dam is
controlled by dam releases. Rafting is a popular activity,
and, accordingly, reservations to raft the river can be
difﬁcult to obtain and private rafting companies that conduct organized trips with river guides can be costly, averaging $2000 to $3000. The trips vary in length and in
amenities, but the average trip takes about 1 week to 10
days and is about 225 miles long. Rafters travel either
in motorized rafts or oar-paddled rafts and camp on
beaches along the river. During the 1972 and 1979 rafting seasons, outbreaks of gastroenteritis among rafters
prompted investigation. An outbreak of the enteric pathogen Shigella sonnei among rafters was reported.5 As a
result of the number of people utilizing the river, and in
an effort to reduce the spread of disease, the National
Park Service mandated in 1978 that all human fecal
waste be carried out rather than buried on beaches or
disposed of in the river. Despite this mandate, outbreaks
of gastroenteritis still occur among rafters. Since 1994,
over 400 rafters in 6 separate outbreaks have become ill
with norovirus (Table 1). While there was a span of 4
years between the 1994 outbreak and the next outbreak
in 1998, outbreaks have occurred consecutively for the
last 4 rafting seasons (2002–05).
Norovirus illness among those participating in recreational activities has been previously reported. In 1994,
7 of 11 canoeists became ill with norovirus after exposure to contaminated recreational lake water.6 Swallowing water and eating food before getting changed out of
clothing worn while canoeing (and wetted with contaminated lake water) were associated with increased risk of
infection (P ⬍ .02 for both exposures). In May and June
of 1999, an outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis occurred among long-distance hikers on the Appalachian
Trail between Catawba and Troutville, VA.7 People who
consumed food prepared at the general store in Catawba
were almost twice as likely to become ill as those who

did not. Tests of water from taps in the store revealed
fecal contamination but were negative for norovirus.
However, stool and serum samples from hikers were
positive for norovirus. The authors concluded that poor
sanitation on the trail, scarce water supplies, and crowding may have contributed to increased risk of norovirus
among long-distance hikers. A waterborne outbreak of
norovirus among snowmobilers occurred in Wyoming in
2001.8 The snowmobilers were consuming well water,
which was later conﬁrmed to contain norovirus. At least
35 cases resulted from this outbreak. In 2002, an outbreak of norovirus occurred in primary school children
who had played in a recreational water fountain,9 and in
2004 a large outbreak of norovirus occurred among visitors and workers at Yellowstone National Park.10 Norovirus outbreaks have also been associated with swimming in contaminated recreational water.11,12
Several factors exacerbate disease severity on the river. The rafters are frequently exposed to high heat during
the rafting season, when temperatures in the canyon often exceed 100⬚F. High temperatures hasten dehydration
as a result of vomiting and diarrhea and increase disease
severity. At the same time, sanitation is limited on the
river. The inability to stop the trip while ill rafters recover leads to vomiting and defecation accidents in or
on the rafts, resulting in a presumably high level of environmental contamination. During the throes of illness,
rafters must sometimes vomit or defecate directly into
the river. Since the river is also the source for drinking,
cooking, and wash water, this is problematic. As a result
of the depth of the canyon, the rafters are geographically
isolated, and medical care is unavailable without evacuation by helicopter. Normal outbreak control measures
are difﬁcult or impossible to apply during an outbreak
among river rafters. For example, those who are ill cannot be effectively isolated from those who are well.
The present study is an investigation of the water
quality along the Colorado River between Glen Canyon
Dam and the convergence of the Colorado River with
Diamond Creek, near Peach Springs, AZ; the study speciﬁcally includes testing for the presence of human norovirus by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additional parameters examined included coliforms and Escherichia coli most probable number
per 100 mL, temperature, turbidity, and pH. Potential
sources of norovirus contamination in the Colorado River were also assessed for norovirus content; these sources include the Glen Canyon Dam Wastewater Treatment
Plant; the Page, AZ, Wastewater Treatment Plant; and
the Wahweap Wastewater Treatment Plant. Four ﬁeld
studies were conducted for sample collection: July 2003;
August 2003; May 2004; and July 2004. Stool samples
from ill patients and composite stool samples from on-

Jones et al
board toilet-cans were analyzed for the presence of human norovirus during the 2003 and 2004 outbreaks. The
history and epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks among
rafters on the Colorado River were reviewed.
Methods
Water and wastewater sample collection and analysis occurred during the summers of 2003 and 2004 as a result
of repeated outbreaks to determine whether there was
ongoing contamination of the river from sources such as
wastewater treatment plants. In July 2003, 2 efﬂuent
samples were obtained, one from the Page, AZ, Wastewater Treatment plant and one from the Glen Canyon
Dam Wastewater Treatment Plant. Also in July 2003,
drinking water from a spigot at the Lee’s Ferry boat
launch was sampled. In August 2003, 1 additional efﬂuent sample was obtained from the Wahweap Wastewater
Treatment Plant. In May 2004, Colorado River water
samples were collected from 5 points along the river
between Lee’s Ferry and Bright Angel Creek conﬂuence.
In July 2004, 6 wastewater samples were taken from the
Glen Canyon Dam Wastewater Treatment Plant. Also in
July 2004, Colorado River water at the Lee’s Ferry boat
launch was sampled. Stool samples from toilets and individual rafters were analyzed in September and October
2003 and in June 2004. The methods used were the same
for all sample dates.
VIRUS CONCENTRATION FROM WATER
The general procedures for the concentration of enteric
viruses used in this study are described in Method 9510
in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater.13 Water samples were collected by pumping
the water through Virosorb 1-MDS Cartridge Filers
(CUNO, Meriden, CT) in plastic ﬁlter housings. Noroviruses were concentrated by adsorption onto the positively charged ﬁlters, as previously described.14 Cartridge ﬁlters were stored in sealable plastic bags and
transported on ice via overnight Federal Express or driven back to the laboratory on the same day. One liter of
3% beef extract (pH 9.5) was used to elute virus from
each ﬁlter. The pH of the eluate was then lowered to 3.5
using 1 N HCl to ﬂocculate the beef extract, and the
solution was stirred slowly for 30 minutes on a stir plate.
The solution was then centrifuged and the supernatant
discarded. The pellet was suspended in 20 mL of 0.15
M sodium phosphate and then ﬁltered through a 0.2-␮m
pore-sized ﬁlter to remove bacteria. Concentrated samples were stored at ⫺20⬚C for further processing. This
method has been proven effective for the concentration
and puriﬁcation of noroviruses.15

VIRUS CONCENTRATION FROM STOOL
Noroviruses were concentrated from stool by suspending
1 g of stool in 7 mL phosphate-buffered saline. Suspensions were then vortexed for 60 seconds and centrifuged
for 30 minutes. The supernatant was removed and aliquoted for storage at ⫺20⬚C until further processing.
RNA EXTRACTION
Viral RNA was puriﬁed from the samples using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA),
and the Mini Spin Protocol was followed with the following minor modiﬁcations: the total sample volume was doubled to 280 ␮L, and a double elution using 2 consecutive
40-␮L volumes of Buffer AVE was performed. The puriﬁed RNA samples were stored at ⫺20⬚C.
REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE–POLYMERASE
CHAIN REACTION
Reverse transcriptase–PCR was performed on the puriﬁed RNA using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit
(QIAGEN). The primers MJV12 (5⬘-TAY CAY TAT
GAT GCH GAY TA-3⬘) and RegA (5⬘-CTC RTC ATC
ICC ATA RAA IGA-3⬘),16 which are modiﬁed JV12/
JV13 primers,17 that are speciﬁc for human norovirus
genogroups I and II polymerase region A were used. A
10-␮L volume of puriﬁed RNA template and a ﬁnal concentration of 1 ␮M of each primer were used in a total
reaction volume of 50 ␮L. Thermal cycling conditions
were as follows: reverse transcription of viral RNA for
60 minutes at 42⬚C; activation of Taq polymerase for 15
minutes at 95⬚C; 40 cycles: 30 seconds at 94⬚C, 30 seconds at 50⬚C, 30 seconds at 72⬚C; and ﬁnal extension
for 10 minutes at 72⬚C. RNase-free water negative controls and known positive norovirus controls were run
concurrently with the unknown samples. Reverse transcriptase–PCR product was visualized using an ethidium
bromide–stained 2% agarose gel run in 0.5⫻ TBE buff-

er. Norovirus-positive RT-PCR product was puriﬁed using the QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (QIAGEN) and
was then sent to the University of Arizona DNA Sequencing Laboratory. Sequences were compared to
known sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST database for conﬁrmation of positive samples as human
norovirus, though the genogroup and strain were not determined. All amplicons reported as norovirus positive
were conﬁrmed as human noroviruses by sequencing.
E. COLI AND TOTAL COLIFORMS
E. coli and total coliform bacteria were tested using a 10tube most probable number protocol and Colilert reagent
(IDEXX, Colilert, Westbrook, ME). A portable incubator
was set up in a local hotel room (Page, AZ) so that samples
could be tested within 6 hours of collection. Samples were
maintained on ice during transport to the hotel.
ADDITIONAL ANALYTES
In addition to testing for norovirus, the following water
quality parameters were tested using the methods shown:
pH (Waterproof pHTestr 3⫹ Double Junction, Oakton
Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL), turbidity (DRT-15CE
Portable Turbidimeter, HF Scientiﬁc Inc, Fort Myers,
FL), and temperature (Waterproof pHTestr 3⫹ Double
Junction 550, Oakton Instruments).
Results
Results from the 2003 ﬁeld sampling of possible sources
of norovirus contamination in the Colorado River are
shown in Table 2. Samples taken from Glen Canyon
Dam Wastewater Treatment Plant; Page, AZ, Wastewater
Treatment Plant; and Wahweap Wastewater Treatment
Plant were all negative for the presence of human noroviruses by RT-PCR speciﬁc for the detection of human

norovirus. An additional sample, taken from the drinking-water tap at Lee’s Ferry boat launch, was also negative for noroviruses.
In May 2004, samples of water were taken from 5
locations along the Colorado River: Lee’s Ferry (mile
0), Vasey’s Paradise (mile 31.9), Eminence Break (mile
44.0), Nankoweap Beach (mile 52.2), and Bright Angel
Creek (mile 87.8). All samples were negative for the
presence of norovirus (Table 3).
In July 2004, samples were collected from the Glen
Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant and from the Colorado River at Lee’s Ferry (Table 4). The sample collected from Lee’s Ferry was negative for noroviruses.
Of 2 samples collected from the secondary clariﬁer at
the Glen Canyon Dam Wastewater Treatment Plant, one
was positive for human norovirus and one was negative.
Two samples of treatment plant efﬂuent were collected
after disinfection, and both showed the presence of E.
coli, although levels were within regulations for recreational water (⬍200 fecal coliforms/100 mL).
In September 2003, 6 composite stool samples from
one trip with ill passengers were analyzed for norovirus;
1 sample tested positive. In October 2003, stool samples
from 3 individual ill rafters were tested for norovirus,

and 2 of the 3 were positive. From the June 2004 outbreak, only 2 composite stool samples were tested, and
both were negative.
Discussion
Routine testing of Colorado River water during nonoutbreak periods was negative for norovirus, indicating that
there is not an ongoing high level of norovirus contamination in the river. Potential sources of norovirus outbreaks among rafters include drinking contaminated river water, consuming contaminated foodstuff, rafter importation of the virus and subsequent person-to-person
spread, and contaminated fomites, campsites, or equipment. It is likely outbreaks are the result of more than
one source of norovirus, and the exact source remains
unknown for several outbreaks.
Water samples from along the Colorado River indicate
that there is not an ongoing high level of contamination
in the river; norovirus has only been isolated directly from
the river on one occasion, in 2002, when the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention isolated norovirus from
river water sampled at Lee’s Ferry.18 Rafter importation
of norovirus may certainly be a contributing factor in

Water Quality in the Colorado River
some outbreaks, especially those in which the ﬁrst individual became ill during the ﬁrst day of the trip. Since
the average incubation period for norovirus is 24 hours,
when rafters become ill quickly, it is reasonable to assume
they may have been infected prior to boarding the raft.
Travelers are exposed to illness at airports, hotels, restaurants, etc, during long trips to Lee’s Ferry from all over
the United States and from all over the world. They may
arrive at the start of the trip having been exposed to the
virus, but not yet showing symptoms. Once one person
on a trip becomes ill, spread to trip-mates may occur readily via aerosolization of vomitus, food contamination, fomite contamination, person-to-person spread, and contamination of the river and campsites. Repeated outbreaks of
norovirus among cruise ship passengers despite extensive
vessel sanitization procedures illustrate how intractable
the virus can be once it has entered a particular population
or environment.3
Treated wastewater is discharged into the Colorado
River 15 miles upstream of Lee’s Ferry, where most rafting trips launch. The treatment plant is located inside of
the Glen Canyon Dam and was implicated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 2002 norovirus outbreak among rafters. The source of the sewage treated at the plant is the Carl B. Hayden Visitor
Center and the facilities operation for the dam itself. The
plant uses ultraviolet (UV) light as its means of disinfection and uses no chemical disinfection. Enteric viruses, such as adenoviruses, have been shown to be UVresistant at doses effective for meeting wastewater regulations for total coliforms,19 though such data are lacking for norovirus.
An overview of outbreaks of norovirus or suspected
norovirus among river rafters from 1994 to 2005 is
shown in Table 1. Of the 6 outbreaks reported, 4 have
occurred in the consecutive previous 4 years. Outbreaks
have begun in May, July, August, and September and
have lasted from just under 2 weeks to almost 2 months
in duration. The river mile at which the ﬁrst case of each
outbreak became ill varies from outbreak to outbreak.
Sometimes, as in the 1998, 2002, and 2003 outbreaks,
the ﬁrst illness occurred during the ﬁrst day of the trip,
within 10 to 16 miles downriver, indicating that the virus
was contracted prior to the trip. During the 1994, 2004,
and 2005 outbreaks, the ﬁrst case was reported to have
occurred several days into the trip and much farther
downriver (20–136 miles), indicating that the virus may
have been contracted on the river. In some cases, the
source of the outbreak was speculated to be the river
water, while some outbreaks are of unknown cause. The
2005 outbreak was epidemiologically linked to contaminated sliced deli meat during an investigation performed
by the National Park Service in cooperation with the

11
Coconino County Health Department and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (unpublished data).
Some outbreaks have involved only 1 river rafting company, while others have involved several; the 1994 outbreak affected 15 companies, the 2002 affected 9, and
the 2005 affected 13. The number of individual trips
affected varies from 1 in 1998 and 2004 to 17 in 2002.
During both the 2003 and 2005 outbreaks, helicopter
evacuation of affected rafters was necessary. All outbreaks except one from 1998 to present were conﬁrmed
via the presence of norovirus in stool samples from individual rafters or from composite stool samples taken
from onboard toilets. Additionally, positive norovirus
samples were obtained from the river water at Lee’s Ferry and the Glen Canyon Dam Wastewater Treatment
Plant during the 2002 outbreak.18
RECOMMENDATIONS
Fomite contamination in norovirus outbreaks has been
recognized as an important factor in the transmission of
the disease in closed populations or conﬁned spaces.20,21
Noroviruses are quite resistant to environmental stresses;
they can withstand cleaning with detergent, and they are
detectable after exposure to 5000 ppm chlorine on fomites.22 Noroviruses are also heat resistant and can survive a temperature of 37⬚C for up to 168 hours.23 Also,
feline calicivirus, a surrogate for norovirus, has been
shown to survive for up to 3 days on telephone buttons
and receivers and for 1 to 2 days on a computer mouse.24
Given the ability of this virus to survive on fomites in
the environment, fomite contamination may play an important role in transmission of norovirus among river
rafters, as commonly shared items such as drinking container spigots or serveware handles are handled by everyone on the trip. Cleaning items with detergent followed by disinfection with a detergent/bleach disinfectant (5000 ppm bleach) with a contact time of 1 minute
is recommended for treating contaminated fomites.22
Rafters are exposed to river water when it is used as
the primary source of drinking water, but they are also
exposed through accidental ingestion, bathing and washing activities, and sometimes through brushing their
teeth. Water ﬁltration devices most commonly used by
the rafters do not remove all viruses from water, so
chemical treatment of the water after ﬁltering is necessary to ensure the water is safe for drinking. The chemical disinfection step is, however, sometimes omitted by
those who object on principle to chemical water treatment or ingestion of chemically treated water. A 2-step
process of ﬁltration followed by chemical treatment is
recommended for drinking water. Point-of-use devices
capable of reducing viral contamination are commer-



12
cially available25 and have been recently shown to reduce human noroviruses (Jones, unpublished data). The
use of these devices could lessen the need for chemical
treatment and increase compliance with water treatment
goals and may help reduce the number of new outbreaks,
or lessen the number of those who become ill in the
advent of an outbreak.
Ethanol solutions of 70% and 90% have been proved
effective at killing 99% of feline calicivirus (a norovirus
surrogate) within a contact time of 1 minute.26 The use of
70% ethanol-based hand-sanitizing gels is advised on rafting trips to provide further sanitization of hands after washing or when clean water for hand washing is not available.
Ill rafters and guides should avoid food handling and
should clean and sanitize their hands before touching
equipment. Because noroviruses can withstand cleaning
with detergents22 and because of their potential for survival
on fomites,24 the disinfection of rafts and equipment between trips is advised. Also, vomitus has been shown to
contain approximately 107 viruses per vomiting incident,27
and it should be considered infectious and should be disposed of in the same manner as fecal waste.
Continued examination of the epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks among rafters on the Colorado River is
needed, because the source of most outbreaks is unknown. Epidemiological investigations may result in information about the source or sources of norovirus, and
this information would be useful in prevention or control
of future outbreaks. Data regarding UV doses required
for inactivation of norovirus would be useful to assess
which levels are adequate to treat wastewater. Existing
technologies aimed at meeting bacterial standards may
not be enough for inactivation of enteric viruses.19 Standards relevant to enteric viruses are needed.
LIMITATIONS
There are several limitations inherent in this study. Testing the river for noroviruses is problematic because the
total volume of the river is so high that the virus becomes very dilute and difﬁcult to detect. Concentration
of the viruses in environmental samples is inefﬁcient.
Using a reach-averaged model of diurnal discharge wave
propagation down the Colorado River generated by the
US Geological Survey28 and monthly stream ﬂow statistics for the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam,
it can be approximated that on average there are 1.7 ⫻
1011 L of river water between Lee’s Ferry and Diamond
Creek, in July, at any moment in time. This is a large
volume of recreational water. At the same time, however,
rafter exposure to this water is quite great. The average
rafter may consume up to 4 L of river water per day,
and there may be 200 to 500 rafters on the river on any

Jones et al
given day. This is an overall exposure of 800 to 2000 L
of water per day. There are between 106 and 1011 noroviruses in just 1 g of fecal matter.27,29 At an average
of 109 viruses per gram, an inoculum of 500 g of norovirus-containing stool into 1.7 ⫻ 1011 L of water
would result in a level of contamination of 3 viruses per
liter, assuming even dispersion. Because of the volume
of water consumed and the infectiousness of the virus,
the level of contamination required to make one person
ill on the Colorado River is small. Also, diffusion of the
virus throughout the huge volume of moving water is
not immediately complete, and in some locations a
point-source, such as an index case, may provide for
exposure to extremely high doses of virus by some rafters. At this time, no human dose-response data or human dose-response model ﬁtting have been published for
norovirus. Consequently, extrapolations and microbial
risk assessments are difﬁcult or impossible to perform
for this virus. It is possible that norovirus is present in
the Colorado River at such low levels that it is below
the level of detection of current methodology, 3 viruses
per 1000 L30; typical sample volumes range from 100
to 400 L depending on the quality (organic content, turbidity) of the water being ﬁltered. However, negative test
results from repeated testing of the river do indicate that
there is not an ongoing high level of norovirus contamination in the river. Dose-response data are available for
many other enteric viruses, and the concentrations of
organisms resulting in a 10⫺4 annual risk of infection
have been shown to be quite low: 2.2 ⫻ 10⫺7 organisms
per liter for rotavirus, 1.5 ⫻ 10⫺5 organisms per liter for
polio 1, and 6.8 ⫻ 10⫺5 organisms per liter for echovirus
12.31 While multiple samples taken from one site over
time are ideal, the high cost per sample and the remote
location of the Colorado River sampling sites limited our
ability to collect samples and reduced the total number
of samples that could be practically collected for study.
Sources of norovirus infection among Colorado River
rafters remain unclear, but several sources are likely responsible. Cases and outbreaks of norovirus, both sporadically and among speciﬁc groups or in speciﬁc settings, continue to occur. Further investigation of these
outbreaks and epidemiological analysis may aid in the
understanding of noroviruses and in prevention of and
response to norovirus outbreaks.
