New approaches should be considered as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves rapidly to develop new beach
monitoring guidelines by the end of 2012, as these guidelines serve as the basis by which states and territories with coasts along the
oceans and Great Lakes can then develop and implement monitoring programs for recreational waters. We describe and illustrate
one possible approach to beach regulation termed as the “Comprehensive Toolbox within an Approval Process (CTBAP).” The
CTBAP consists of three components. The first is a “toolbox” consisting of an inventory of guidelines on monitoring targets, a
series of measurement techniques, and guidance to improve water quality through source identification and prevention methods.
The second two components are principles of implementation. These include first, “flexibility” to encourage and develop an
individualized beach management plan tailored to local conditions and second, “consistency” of this management plan to ensure a
consistent national level of public health protection. The results of this approach are illustrated through a case study at a wellstudied South Florida recreational marine beach. This case study explores different monitoring targets based on two different
health endpoints (skin versus gastrointestinal illness) and recommends a beach regulation program for the study beach that focuses
predominately on source prevention.

1. Introduction
There is a growing health concern related to swimming in
contaminated waters. Globally, each year, there are in excess
of an estimated 120 million cases of gastrointestinal disease
and in excess of an estimated 50 million cases of more severe
respiratory diseases associated with swimming and bathing
in wastewater-polluted coastal waters [1]. Since the 1950s,
epidemiologic studies have been designed to evaluate the
relationship between swimming in point source-impacted
beaches and health risks (i.e., gastrointestinal disease, respiratory, eye, nose, and throat illnesses); they have concluded that
symptoms for all these illnesses were increased in swimmers
compared to nonswimmers [2, 3]. Outbreak reports from the

CDC also confirm that illnesses in the USA are occurring
from swimming in contaminated waters [4]. The excess
illnesses associated with coastal water pollution can also
result in substantial economic burdens. A study in Orange
County, CA, estimated 3.3 million US dollars per year in
excess illness costs for Newport and Huntington Beaches
associated with bathing in marine waters [5].
Swimming-related illness is predominately associated
with exposure to microbial pathogens, which may enter
the water through point sources such as sewage outfalls.
However, recent studies have demonstrated that swimmingrelated illnesses can occur at nonpoint source beaches [6, 7]
and even possibly from beach sand contact [8–10]. These
developments highlight the ongoing challenge to beach

1.1. Current US Regulation. At the US federal level, jurisdiction over recreational waters is provided through the Clean
Water Act (CWA). The CWA provides the US EPA with
jurisdiction over two approaches for the control of water
quality. First, it provides jurisdiction to regulate discharges
of pollutants into the waters of the United States. Specifically,
the CWA regulates discharges that represent point sources of
pollution, that is, industrial, municipal, and other discharges
via conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches. Second,
the CWA provides the authority to set point-of-use standards
for surface waters. Waterbodies must not exceed contaminant
levels beyond allowable values as determined by their “designated use” (swimming, bathing, surfing, water skiing, etc.). In
most situations, the authority to issue discharge permits and
to set designated use standards is delegated by the EPA to the
states, thereby providing the states with the full authority to
implement, that is, monitoring compliance, permitting, and
enforcement.
The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal
Health (BEACH) Act of 2000, an amendment to the CWA,
sets forth beach water quality guidelines for 30 eligible states
and territories with coasts along the oceans and Great Lakes.
These guidelines include limits for Enterococcus in marine
waters and for both Enterococcus and E. coli in freshwater. A
single-maximum value, as well as a monthly geometric mean,
is recommended by the Act [13]. While all 30 states affected by
the BEACH Act follow these guidelines, many states employ
unique additional sets of parameters to assess the safety of
recreational waters (Table 1) [14]. In the U.S water monitoring includes measures at approximately 3,000 beaches
for fecal indicator bacteria, resulting in 18,500 closures or
advisory days in 2009 issued for recreational beaches [14]
(Figure 1).
Seventeen of the 30 states under the BEACH Act preemptively close at least some of their beaches after significant rainfall. Twenty-eight states vary sampling based on
season and sampling more often during the summer months.
Twenty-two states vary the frequency of sampling based on
usage and sample more often at beaches with higher human
usage. Twenty-five states base the location of their sampling
on usage or proximity to a possible source of contamination.
Two states (Massachusetts and Hawaii) test waters for pharmaceutical chemicals that would be discharged with human
sewage. Seven states have predictive models in effect for
some of their beaches; many of which have proven to be
more effective than the culture-based monitoring techniques
[15]. Four states bordering the Gulf of Mexico close beaches
after hurricanes. Texas monitors for V. vulnificus in addition
to Enterococcus and Hawaii adds C. perfringens to their

managers and public health professionals in monitoring the
beach environment and protecting the health of its users
[11, 12]. To address this challenge, we provide background
information about existing regulations; describe a possible
alternative approach given the existing regulations; and then
apply this alternative approach to a well-studied South
Florida recreational marine beach to illustrate one possible
outcome of the alternate approach.

microbial testing. New York and Rhode Island utilize sanitary
surveys in their monitoring efforts, taking into consideration
environmental parameters (such as tidal stage, wild life, and
seaweed). New Hampshire has an internet-based system in
place where advisories are posted based on self-reported
illnesses acquired from swimming at certain beaches [14].
Florida monitors its coastal beaches on a weekly basis year
round using Enterococcus as the fecal microbe indicator.
Florida applies the 2004 EPA’s Recreational water Quality
Criteria (RWQC) for a single sample and geometric mean to
issue beach advisories [16].
1.2. International Regulations. International regulations
include those of the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the European Union (EU) [17, 18]. The WHO approach
differs from the US traditional monitoring guidelines in that

Figure 2: Comprehensive Toolbox within an Approval Process (CTBAP) Approach. This approach is based upon three steps which include:
an inventory through the comprehensive toolbox (CTB) and two implementation principles to ensure “flexibility” and “consistency”. The
inventory (a.k.a. comprehensive toolbox, CTB) consists of the methods and tools to address recreational water quality and include guidance
for source identification and prevention along with guidance for monitoring targets and techniques. The principles of implementation are
“flexibility” which is to be incorporated into the local beach regulation plan and “consistency” through a national review panel charged with
assuring a consistent level of public health protection.”

the susceptibility of the beach to fecal pollution (i.e., the
likelihood of various fecal sources from reaching the water)
is taken into account when determining the monitoring
criteria [17]. Beaches without a known point source of
human fecal pollution are allowed higher levels of fecal
indicator microbes than ones which do.
The EU [18] regulates the sampling program (frequency
of sampling, location of sampling, and time of sampling),
including algae and/or their toxins as indicators of human
health risk [19] and, most importantly, the requirement of
“beach water profiles” for all beaches in the EU. The beach
water profile is a critical addition to the regulation since it
requires beaches to be assessed for physical, geographical, and
hydrological conditions as well as potential pollution sources.
These profiles are to be updated every 2 to 4 years depending
on their history (i.e., whether determined to be excellent,
good, sufficient, or poor) [18].

2. Methods, Alternative Approach to
Current Beach Regulations
The proposed method is based upon an alternative approach
which takes into consideration existing beach regulations.
It is clear that the US regulations focus on contaminant
discharges and monitoring for fecal microbe indicator levels,
whereas international regulations rely more heavily on the
allowable water quality levels, which for the WHO include
an expectation of flexibility based upon susceptibility of the
beach.
Specifically, we propose the establishment of an effective
criterion which we call the “Comprehensive Toolbox within
an Approval Process, (CTBAP)” (Figure 2). The CTBAP is

based upon three steps which include an inventory and two
implementation principles. The inventory (a.k.a. comprehensive toolbox, CTB) consists of the methods and tools to
address recreational water quality. These include guidance
for source identification and prevention, along with guidance
for monitoring targets and techniques. The two principles of
implementation are “flexibility” which is to be incorporated
into the local beach regulation plan and “consistency” to
provide a consistent level of public health protection at the
national level. A consistent national level of health protection
implies that the monitoring targets provide the same level of
risk, regardless of geographic location. So instead of setting
the allowable indicator bacteria level at one consistent value,
which is currently practiced through the US regulations,
health risks would be set at a consistent level. The underlying
theory behind this approach is to allow and expect for state,
county, or even beach-specific flexibility, with a national
approval mechanism for a nationally comparable level of
human health protection. The methods and techniques in the
alternative approaches would then be incorporated into the
CTB.
This national CTB with initial organization at the federal
level would create a resource which local teams (consisting of
managers and scientists as well as other parties with expertise
in the specific local conditions) may use to strategize the
local beach management plan that would work best for
them. A national CTB, in addition to providing options
for monitoring targets and techniques, should also include
guidance concerning sampling time, location, frequency,
and method; predictive modeling (forecast and nowcast);
information on how to communicate beach conditions to
beach goers; sanitary survey methods; source tracking/tracer

study methods; health risk study techniques to include quantitative microbial risk assessments, epidemiologic studies,
self-reporting systems; pollution prevention methods via
infrastructure, community education, animal control, and so
forth. This CTB will need to be updated continuously by the
national regulatory agency to keep up with the knowledge
gained from new advances in the field of recreational water
quality monitoring and pollution prevention.
Specifically to provide “flexibility” to state and local beach
regulators, we recommend (1) an allowable range of targets
based upon the susceptibility of the beach to fecal pollution
as in the WHO approach and (2) an allowance for additional
measures and controls as in the EU approach. We believe the
concept of flexibility can also go further to include allowances
for multiple lines of evidence to establish an overall safety
level. For example, currently in recreational water quality
monitoring, some states include multiple measures, but
typically these measures are independent; if the threshold
for either measure is exceeded, then an advisory is issued.
Another component of the “flexibility” paradigm would be
to allow for a safety assessment based upon integrated lines
of evidence. An integrated line of evidence is consistent with
the approach used for air quality standards. For example, for
air quality standards, multiple constituents are measured, and
collectively they are integrated to develop a “hazard” index,
that is, Air Quality Index (AQI) [20]. A similar approach can
be included as an option in the CTBAP process for developing
standards for recreational bathing, where multiple lines of
evidence can be used to collectively evaluate the probability of
illness. These multiple lines of evidence can include measures
of indicator microbes, results from modeling, weather conditions, measures of additional microbes (including possibly
pathogens), and other factors.
The second principle, that of “consistency,” establishes a
consistent health protection level across the country. One
concern in providing too much flexibility to the states is
that health protection will not be equal across the nation.
The solution for this may be a national and diverse team
of experts under a national agency (such as the US EPA)
which could regularly review the proposed beach regulation
plans of the individual states. Given the specificity of the
beach, the current state of the science, and experiences as
well as beach regulation plans of other beaches, this panel
will either approve or recommend certain modifications to
the beach regulation plan. This will allow for the development
of a site-specific plan that is acceptable and comparable to
other beach regulation plans. Therefore, the baseline used is
not a single microbiological criterion, which may give a false
sense of equal protection (since recommended indicators
perform differently at different beaches and under different
conditions), but a single team of expert reviewers who would
assess health risk.
In order to implement such an approach, beach regulators
should be given a reasonable amount of time to develop their
beach regulation plans after the release of the CTB by the EPA.
Until then, the traditional criteria may remain in effect. As the
number of approved plans increases, a matrix may develop
similar to that proposed by Boehm et al. 2009 [11]. The matrix
as recommended by these authors would be based on certain

Journal of Environmental and Public Health
factors (such as climate conditions and pollution sources) as
well as any other factor that is deemed important by the state
and/or local regulatory agency. Although this direction of
beach regulation is recommended for the upcoming years and
decades as science advances rapidly, such an approach will
also be more difficult to apply than the traditional approach
of beach regulation and requires initially a larger burden on
both the local beach regulators and the EPA. Therefore, the
actual implementation of such an approach will depend on
when such an approach becomes feasible at the local and
national levels.

3. Results, Outcomes from Applying
the Recommended Approach
To illustrate some of the aspects of the recommended
approach, a well-studied nonpoint source beach is used as a
case study. Assuming the existence of a comprehensive toolbox as proposed above from which guidance may be derived,
along with the local conditions known about this beach, a
beach regulation plan may be developed. What follows is a
discussion of the different aspects that may be included in
such a beach regulation plan which would then be submitted
to the national regulatory panel for review and approval.
Given that the case study beach is well studied, the data from
the actual beach may be used in order to guide the development of the proper monitoring techniques/targets and
source identification/prevention approaches to be included
in the beach regulation plan. Regulators for beaches not well
studied may need to couple knowledge of their beach with
any available studies from similar beaches (similar in terms
of pollution sources, geographic region, beach use, resources,
etc.) in order to develop their site-specific beach regulation
plan.
3.1. Beach Water Profile. The case study beach is located
on Virginia Key within Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA,
geographically classified as “subtropical” with an average
ambient temperature of 24.8∘ C. This beach is the only beach
in the county that allows pets [21]. Given the fact that
admission is free and that the beach is located in a central
location accessible by many of the county’s residents, the
beach can become overcrowded especially on weekends and
holidays, during hours when the beach is open (between
dawn and dusk) [22].
Extensive evaluation of the vicinity of the study beach
did not find contributions from point sources of pollution
to this beach (such as sewage outfalls, failing lift stations,
and cross connections of sewage with storm drains), or less
obvious nonpoint sources (such as septic tanks) [23]. This
beach is usually in compliance with regulatory monitoring
criteria but periodically (i.e., 0.9 times per year averaged from
2002 to 2012) has been placed under a beach advisory due to
microbial water quality violations (Florida Healthy Beaches
Program Database).
At the study beach, indicator microbe levels vary significantly both spatially (location) and temporally (time)

offshore) is considered to be more strongly associated with human health.

[24–26], as is frequently observed at other beaches [27–
30]. Enterococci, the current microbial target recommended
for marine waters and used by regulators at the study
beach, varied based on the location of sampling, with higher
levels observed near the shoreline and lower levels observed
offshore. These spatial differences are hypothesized to be due
to Enterococci release from the intertidal sand zone where
microbes are believed to regrow and persist [31–33]. Temporal
variability is driven at the site by a combination of tidal,
rainfall, and solar radiation effects [31, 34, 35].
Given the extensive beach-specific data, it becomes clear
that any monitoring target (i.e., such as Enterococci) should
include a monitoring technique that considers both spatial
and temporal variability for the study beach (Table 2). If
Enterococci from the shoreline sand are considered to be
related to human health, the monitoring technique should
be designed so that this Enterococci signal would be the
most obvious. This would mean sampling at locations and
times where microbial concentrations are expected to be most
elevated and during times that people may be exposed to
those waters (i.e., during the morning, after peak hightide
or rainfall events, and as close as possible to the shoreline).
However, if a relationship between Enterococci and human
health at this study beach is believed to be driven by offshore
sources of Enterococci, such as inadvertent sewage spills,
regulators may consider developing sampling strategies that
target these sources. This would entail sampling at locations
and times where microbial concentrations from sand sources
are expected to be least (i.e., during noon and afternoon,
after peak low tide, avoiding sampling after rain events, and
sampling offshore possibly at waist deep waters) (Table 2).
In this case, elevated Enterococci levels would indicate a
new offshore and potentially hazardous pollution source.
Currently samples are collected in waist deep water which
is consistent with a focus on identifying offshore sewage
impacts and avoiding the high background levels associated
with the nonpoint sources that originate from the intertidal
zone.
3.2. Monitoring Targets and Disease Endpoints. Monitoring targets can include microbial, chemical, hydrologic, or
another indicator of a health risk, whereas disease endpoints
can include gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory, eye, and ear
illnesses. The most common disease endpoint evaluated traditionally for recreational swimming is gastrointestinal illness
(GI). A common method to compare potential monitoring

targets to disease end-points is through epidemiologic studies. This is accomplished through identifying the associations
between human health outcomes and monitoring targets.
In the vast majority of beaches in the USA, an epidemiologic study specifically for that beach is not available, and
therefore epidemiologic studies at similar beaches or other
methodologies such as quantitative microbial risk assessment
(QMRA) [36] may be used to assist in identifying appropriate
monitoring targets.
At the study beach, a randomized control epidemiology
study with comprehensive water microbial and environmental monitoring was completed [6, 34, 37]. During the
epidemiology study, an increased risk of self-reported skin,
respiratory, and gastrointestinal illnesses were associated
with recreational bathing [6]. Statistically significant associations were observed between (a) skin disease and Enterococci
levels determined by membrane filtration, (b) skin disease
and to 24-hour antecedent rainfall, and (c) respiratory illness
and the inverse of water temperature [37]. Neither environmental conditions nor microbes evaluated in this study were
found to statistically relate to self-reported gastrointestinal
illness. However, the results of the study did indicate a
possible pattern between gastrointestinal illness and both F−
coliphage and Giardia spp., both being detected on 4 of the 15
total study days (Table 3) [34], and both were detected on 3 of
the 5 days characterized by the highest excess gastrointestinal
illness (see the number represented by asterisk (∗ ) in Table 3).
Given the principle of “flexibility”, these targets, F− coliphage
and Giardia spp., should be thus considered as additions to
the CTB that is used to assess water quality at this site.
With respect to disease end-points, we implement the
concept of flexibility through the consideration of multiple
health endpoints [34] (Table 2), which is based on measured
health endpoints from more than one type of illness (e.g., gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory). With this methodology,
regulators are potentially guarding against a wider range of
health impacts that may result from bathing, and hence from
other pollution sources besides human sewage containing
enteric pathogens. However, the multiple health endpoints,
when applied to the data available for the study beach, were
driven by the increased report of skin illnesses given their
predominance relative to other illnesses. Therefore, for the
case study beach, the multiple health endpoints approach may
be considered where one microbial target would be used to
assess risks from skin illnesses and another target would be
used to assess gastrointestinal illness.

3.3. Source Identification and Prevention. Although monitoring is an important aspect of beach regulation, source
identification followed by source prevention is the key to
establishing the safety of the beach environment in a longterm sustainable manner. This focus is also consistent with
the jurisdiction of the EPA through the CWA to minimize
contaminant discharges. However, the beach profiled for the
study site did not identify point sources of pollution. Instead,
several nonpoint sources were identified including rainfall
runoff [31], bather shedding [38, 39], dog feces [21], and sand
diffusion [40, 41]. Such observations are not only observed at
the study beach but also at many other beach sites throughout
the USA and beyond [11, 15, 42]. All of these sources come
in contact with the beach sand and/or are directly released
from the beach sand. Furthermore, analysis of the beach
sand at the site has identified potential pathogenic microbes
including protozoa, helminthes, fungi, and the bacteria, S.
aureus [43, 44].
The focus should be thus on remediation of sand sources
through multiple means, such as controlling runoff [45] and
solid waste control [46], limiting the number of pets, birds
[47], and minimizing human shedding through the provision
of showers [43].
To address the need to remediate nonpoint diffuse sources
of contamination, various source identification techniques
[48] need to be available to beach regulators in the CTB in
order for them to include these techniques in their beach
regulation plan. Sanitary survey approaches, tracer study
techniques, and microbial source tracking methodologies
need to be simplified and made more accessible to regulators
through inclusion in the CTB. Once sources are identified,
through the guidance of the CTB, beach regulators can
conduct various source prevention techniques as part of their
beach regulation plan.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
The complexity of the beach system, especially that of beaches
not dominated by a point source of pollution [34], implies
that more novel and comprehensive approaches will be
needed in order to more effectively protect the health of

bathers, while at the same time limiting overconservatism
which may lead to unnecessary beach closures and economic
loss [5]. The CTBAP proposes the development of a comprehensive toolbox which provides an inventory of potential
monitoring targets, measurement techniques, and guidance
for source identification and prevention. The implementation
would be based upon principles of “flexibility” where states
are encouraged to identify their own targets as they develop
beach management plans and “consistency” which includes
an assessment of the plans at the national level to ensure a
consistent level of human health protection.
To that end, the specific recommendations for the study
beach reviewed here focus on controlling discharges and
providing more flexibility for the allowable levels at the
point-of-use. The study beach’s main pollution source as
described above is the sand which serves as a reservoir for
indicator and pathogenic microbes inoculated into the sand
by anthropogenic- and animal-related sources. Therefore, the
continued monitoring of the sand and remediation as needed
are recommended to prevent the sand from becoming a
source of microbes that constantly contaminates the water
via environmental conditions such as tidal action and rainfall.
This is in addition to the source prevention techniques mentioned earlier (i.e., runoff diversion and treatment and bather
and dog source remediation and prevention) to preemptively
limit sand and water pollution.
Within the confines of the current US regulations, it is
understood that the EPA has limited authority, including
limitations to regulating water only (as opposed to regulating
beach sands). Within this limitation and given the need to
control pollution sources, it is recommended that states, as
part of their implementation plans, consider the inclusion
of sand measures as part of their monitoring program.
Ideally beach management plans should include a focus on
maintaining sand quality as a means of improving water
quality. Ideally the CTB, established at the federal level, would
acknowledge sand as a potential source and ideally the CTB
would also provide guidance for measuring, modeling, and
remediating microbes from sand sources.
With respect to allowable levels at the point-of-use,
no relationship was found at the study site between fecal



Journal of Environmental and Public Health
indicator bacteria and gastrointestinal illness. Indicator levels
at the site are strongly dictated by environmental conditions
which may not be related to the pathogens of concern
and hence the lack of health relation. However, given the
potential association with skin illness, Enterococci should
still remain in this beach’s monitoring criterion. Therefore,
the recommended criteria should include Enterococci, with
the understanding that an elevation in values may indicate
a potential skin illness risk as opposed to a gastrointestinal
illness-related health risk. This should then be taken into
account by regulators in determining whether or not to
place beach advisories based on this indicator alone. If such
advisories are placed, it is recommended that the risk communication strategy take into account the potential disease
outcome (e.g., recommending freshwater showers after using
the beach).
Enterococci would also be beneficial to evaluate potential
sewage contamination from offshore sources; as such the
sampling protocol should include sampling, as explained
earlier, where levels would be expected to be low based on
sampling time and location (i.e., sampling in waistdeep water
during noon or afternoon). High levels in these situations
should be taken seriously as they may indicate the influence
of other offshore fecal sources of pollution (e.g., from moored
boats) besides the expected dominant source of sand diffusion.
A study is also recommended for this beach to determine
whether the addition of F− coliphage and Giardia spp. may
serve as indicators of gastrointestinal-related illness given the
prior limited epidemiologic results, and hence their addition
to the monitoring program. This may be accomplished
through an approach other than traditional epidemiology
studies such as quantitative microbial risk assessments. If
further studies warrant their use, F− coliphage may be added
as a monitoring target along with Enterococci, while Giardia
spp. may be used as a confirmatory target for the presence
of gastrointestinal health risk. The proposed beach regulation
plan for point-of-use monitoring would be similar to the
existing sampling plan for this beach except with a different
understanding of how to use Enterococci and interpret its
levels, an emphasis on source prevention (e.g., minimize
dog fecal contamination, runoff management, solid waste
management, etc.), and potential supplementary monitoring
(F− coliphage and Giardia spp.) to assist in predicting gastrointestinal illness.
Implementation of the “Comprehensive toolbox within
an Approval Process,” for this particular study site would
greatly benefit from guidance with respect to minimizing
impacts from sand sources, would benefit from guidance
in assessing measures of F− coliphage and Giardia spp.,
would benefit from guidelines for sample collection and
processing, and would benefit from guidelines for assessing
nontraditional disease end-points such as skin ailments.
These components can be added to the CTB once approved
through the federal level review board thereby ensuring a
comparable national protection level through this panel.
The authors acknowledge that development of a CTBAP
would require a considerable amount of additional resources.
Evaluation of state proposals and incorporating the approved

7
methods into a federally maintained CTB requires validation of alternative approaches on a continuous basis,
along with consensus building and considerable engagement
with the states and beach managers. Implementation of the
CTBAP would thus require a considerable investment in
time and resources by both federal and state governments,
an investment that could payoff in the long-term through
improvements in water quality and ultimately public health.
As implied by Dwight et al., [5], excess illness costs associated
with recreational swimming are on the order of many of
millions of dollars per year for two California beaches alone.
Considering all of the beaches nationally, the payoff could be
substantial for investments aimed at improving methods for
monitoring and improving water quality at recreational beach
sites.
