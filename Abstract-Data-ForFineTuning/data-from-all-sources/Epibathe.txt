Risk of gastroenteritis (GI) was higher amongst bathers in both Hungarian and Spanish
trials.
The excess GI risk in bathers from marine water sites (Spain) were 3 times higher than
those from freshwater sites (Hungary), using non-bathers from the corresponding
country as baseline.
The risk of GI was markedly higher when bathers in freshwater studies were exposed
to >200 enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1), compared with those exposed to less than that level.
In the Spanish studies, risk of GI varied only slightly between bathers exposed to
higher or below 100 Enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1).
Both studies lacked strong evidence of any dose-response relationship between GI and
enterococci levels.
Non-water related confounding factors played a minor role in determining the risks of
GI.

A2.1.1

Background

This report summarises the findings from the Hungarian and Spanish trials of the Epibathe
project. Data were analysed using logistic regression models and adjusted for non-water related
confounders. Results showed that there was an increased risk of gastroenteritis (GI) in bathers,
and that the risk was approximately 3 times higher in marine water than freshwater sites. When
bathers were stratified into various groups according to exposure levels, logistic regression
modelling failed to show any strong dose-response relationships between GI and enterococci
concentration in the water. Further analyses including data from the UK and German studies
would be necessary to confirm the findings in this report. Furthermore, with the increased
statistical power the dose-response relationships between exposure and GI could be re-examined.

A2.1.2

Methods

A2.1.2.1

Study sites

A total of 8 individual trials took place at 6 sites over two bathing seasons in Hungary and Spain
(Table 1). All of the chosen beaches complied with the EU mandatory bacteriological criteria for
bathing waters, and were therefore considered as representative of compliant European beaches.
Appendix 2 Section 1

Page 1 of 10



A2.1.2.2

Microbiology

All study sites were divided into several bathing zones, and water samples were collected every
20mins at chest depth from each zone throughout the trial. Enterococci levels were measured by
membrane filtration method (Slanetz) (ISO7899-2:2000).
A2.1.2.3

Assigning personal exposures

During the trials all bathers were required to bath for 10mins in their designated bathing zones
and make at least 3 head immersions. They were then retrospectively assigned to an exposure
level prior to statistical analysis. Personal exposure levels were determined by the enterococci
concentrations in the water sample collected from the corresponding bathing zone and nearest
time zone where bathing took place. The mean value was used when exposure occurred exactly
between two time zones. This assignment method was identical to the one used in the original
UK study (Kay et al 1994).
A2.1.2.4

Disease symptoms

The main outcome of interest was self-reported GI either at 1 week or 3 weeks after the trial day.
GI was defined as any case of diarrhoea or vomiting, or any case of indigestion or nausea
accompanied by fever (see list below). Any participants that suffered from chronic bowel
problems or reported GI symptoms on the trial day were excluded from the analysis. Both the GI
definition and the exclusion criteria were adopted from the original UK study (Kay et al 1994).

Statistical analysis

Data from the same country were pooled and analysed by logistic regression modelling using the
statistical software Stata 10 (StataCorp 2008). Logistic regression is a statistical model for
predicting the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve. In Epibathe
the probability of an outcome, i.e. GI, was predicted by the concentration of exposure to
enterococci at personal level, and controlling for other non-water related confounders such as
age, gender, and the consumption of “high risk” food etc. In this report, results produced from
models without controlling for confounders are referred to as “crude”, and those from models
controlled for confounders are referred to as “adjusted”. The confounders adjusted for during this
stage of the modelling are presented below.

Excess GI risks were examined by comparing disease prevalence in bathers with their nonbathing counterparts, as well as between bathers with different exposure levels. The presence of
any dose-response relationships between enterococci level and GI were also examined. This was
carried out by stratifying the exposure data of the bathers into 4 groups, using their quartile
values as cut-points to eliminate any subjectivity in the selection process. For this purpose two
approaches were taken; 1. Using quartile cut-points derived from the corresponding study
country, and 2. Using quartile cut-points of all the data from Hungary and Spain. The former
approach ensured that the subjects were equally distributed in each group and, therefore,
increased the statistical power, whilst the latter allowed direct comparison of the odds ratios
(OR) in each quartile group as they shared common cut-points.
In addition, exposure data were divided into 20 unit intervals of enterococci to determine the
point where GI risk started to increase. Finally, analyses were carried out using the EC Bathing
Water Directive (2006/7/EC) guideline levels as cut-points to examine whether the strictest level
(“excellent quality”) would provide better health protection than less stringent ones, using nonbathers as baseline. The current standards of “excellent quality” for marine and freshwaters are
less than 100 and 200 enterococci/100ml respectively, based upon a 95-percentile evaluation.
The Epibathe project measures individual exposure levels rather than a 95th percentile value and
the 206 Directive percentiles values were used as individual ‘spot’ exposure estimates in this
analysis. All results obtained from logistic regression modelling were presented as odds ratios
(OR).
An explanatory note on odds and risks
The chances of developing GI were represented by odds ratios (OR) throughout the study,
which measures the excess risk of GI in a particular group compared with the corresponding
non-bathing group. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the event, e.g. GI, is equally likely in both
the bathing and non-bathing group. An odds ratio greater than 1 implies bathers are more
likely to develop GI, and an odds ratio less than 1 implies bathers are less likely to develop
GI. Where an outcome is uncommon, then odds and risks can be regarded as equivalent. Since
the incidence of GI measured in Epibathe were low, in this report, the terms “risk” and “odds”
have been used interchangeably to describe the differences in probabilities of developing an
outcome.

Results

Data from 4,441 subjects were available from the database but some were subsequently removed
due to missing data (n=74) or because they matched the exclusion criteria (n=179). In the final
dataset there were 2,301 entries from Hungary and 1,887 from Spain (Table 2).

Risk of GI in bathers

Results showed that the risks of GI were higher amongst bathers compared with non-bathers.
After controlling for non-water related confounders the excess risk of GI was 12% in Hungary
(freshwater) (Table 3) and 32% in Spain (marine water) (Table 4), using non-bathers as baseline
values. However none of the results achieved statistical significance.

Exposure levels in bathers were stratified into regular intervals of 20 nterococci (cfu. 100ml-1) to
examine any presence of dose-response relationship between GI and indicator organism level.
No dose-response relationships were found in any of the studies, as there were no clear trends in
odds ratios (OR), either increasing or decreasing, across different exposure groups (Table 5 & 6).

When exposure data were stratified into 4 different groups by their quartile cut-points, there were
no evidence of any dose-response relationship between exposure and GI in neither the Hungarian
(Table 7) nor Spanish studies (Table 8). In addition, a set of common quartile cut-points were
derived from all studies for comparing the difference in GI risks between freshwater (Table 9)
and marine water (Table 10). Again, no signs of any dose-response relationships between
exposure and GI were observed.

Risk of GI in bathers using the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cutpoint

An increased risk of GI was observed in both Hungarian and Spanish sites when bathers were
exposed to enterococci concentrations higher than the level that approximately resembled the
2006/7/EC “excellent quality” criteria, i.e. 100 and 200 enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1) for marine
water and freshwater respectively. In Hungary, compared with non-bathers, there was an excess
risk of 3% when bathing took place in water with less than 200 enterococci, but increased to 50%
once the bacterial level had exceeded 200 (Table 11). Similarly in Spain, the risk of GI was 29%
higher than the non-bathing group when exposure took place in water below 100 enterococci
(cfu. 100ml-1), and slightly increased to 38% when exposure reached beyond 100 (Table 12).

Discussion

Using logistic regression modelling, results from the Hungarian and Spanish trials of Epibathe
showed an increased risk of GI in bathers compared with non-bathers. Furthermore, the excess
GI risk associated with marine water exposure (Spain) was approximately 3-fold higher than that
of freshwater (Hungary). The difference in GI risk between fresh and marine water sites was also
observed when exposure data were stratified into 2 groups using cut-points approximately based
on the current EC Bathing Directive “excellent level” criteria. In freshwater sites, the risk of GI
elevated slightly by 3% (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.61-1.74) in bathers exposed to less than 200
enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1), i.e. within the limit of “excellent quality”, but increased to 50%
(OR=1.50, 95% CI 0.67-3.35) in those exposed to more than 200 enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1) in the
water. These results contrasted those observed in marine water studies, in which the risk
increased by 29% (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.82-2.03) even when the enterococci level was within the
“excellent level” limit (100 enterococci (cfu. 100ml-1)), but only increased further by 9%
(OR=1.38, 95% CI 0.80-2.40) once over 100 enterococci. Although none of the results were
statistical significant, the study in Spain suggested that recreational bathing in marine water was
associated with an increased risk of GI even when exposure took place in water that met the
strictest compliant level of the bathing standards. Such observation was opposite to that seen in
Hungary, in which the excess risk of GI was considerably lower (3%) when bathing in “excellent
quality” water.
Overall the logistic regression models had failed to detect any strong dose-response relationships
between GI and exposures, and none of the models had reached statistical significance. Such
observations could be due to the low GI attack rates and the relatively small sample size of the
studies; in a study when attack rates are low, a large sample will be required to detect small and
statistically significant changes in the outcome. We therefore conclude that further analyses
including data from the UK and German studies will be required to confirm the findings in this
report. In addition, with the increased sample size and therefore the statistical power, the doseresponse relationship between GI and exposures can be re-examined.
In this report personal exposure levels were divided into different categories rather than treated
as continuous data in the logistic regression models. This was because the exposure level of each
bather was based on the dozens of samples collected from each study site. Therefore they are
treated as categorical since exposure levels could only fall onto one of the values derived from
the water samples.

Excess risk of gastroenteritis (GI) was found in bathers compared with non-bathers.
A positive dose-response relationship was found between GI and enterococci
concentration in water, and reached statistical significance at 100 enterococci/100ml.
Risk of GI in bathers from marine water sites was 2-fold higher than those from
freshwater sites, based on the levels of enterococci observed in the study.
When stratified by water type the dose-response relationship was more pronounced
for marine water sites.
Despite exposure taking place in water classified as “excellent quality”
(approximation to the current bathing water standards), GI risks in those bathers were
higher compared with non-bathers.
Non-water related confounding factors played a minor role in determining the risks of
GI.

A2.2.1

Background

To assess the overall risk of gastroenteritis associated with recreational bathing in European
waters, and to examine whether the risk differs between marine and fresh water sites.
Rationale for a meta-analysis approach
Epidemiological studies often involve combing data from a number of smaller studies on study
populations separated by geographical location and/or time. Even if the studies are broadly
comparable, sampling error will mean that results will inevitably vary somewhat between them.
Heterogeneity between studies might lead to the under or over-estimation of the true effect. In
the case of Epibathe, although the same protocol was used in all trials, the trials were carried out
in four countries over a period of 18 years with different study teams. Should the pooled
Epibathe data be analysed as a single study, bathers and non-bathers (i.e. baseline) within
different trials would be compared, potentially leading to biased estimations of effect.
The statistical methods used to combine the results of all studies into a summary effect estimate,
together with confidence intervals, are known as meta-analysis. In contrast to carrying out a

Appendix 2 Section 2

Page 1 of 29



pooled analysis, a meta-analysis estimates the effects of exposure for each individual study and
combines the results to give an overall estimate of the effect, i.e. a summary odds ratio. For
Epibathe, this will ensure that bathers are only compared with non-bathers from the same trial
who shared similar characteristics and baseline risks. A “weight” is given to each trial which
determines its contribution towards the final model; larger studies with less random variation
will be given more weight than the others. A series of smaller studies may tend to have
inconclusive findings that contradict with one another, but meta-analysis is able to overcome the
problem by drawing results from all trials and give rise to more precise estimations through
increased statistical power. Furthermore, any heterogeneity between studies due to different
sampling schemes can be accounted for with the use of random-effects modelling.

Methods

A2.2.2.1

Study sites

A total of 17 individual trials took place at 15 sites on different occasions in UK, Germany,
Hungary, and Spain (Table 1). All of the chosen beaches complied with the EU mandatory
bacteriological criteria for bathing waters, and were therefore considered as representative of
compliant European beaches.

A2.2.2.2

Microbiology

All study sites were divided into several bathing zones, and water samples were collected
every 20mins at chest depth from each zone throughout the trial. Enterococci levels were
measured by membrane filtration method (Slanetz) (ISO7899-2:2000) in UK, Spain, and
Hungary, and by microtitre plate method (variable name ‘IE96wells’) (ISO7899-1:1998) in
Germany.
A2.2.2.3

Assigning personal exposures

During the trials all bathers were required to bath for 10mins in their designated bathing zones
and make at least 3 head immersions. They were then retrospectively assigned to an exposure
level prior to statistical analysis. In UK, Hungary, and Spain the personal exposure levels
were determined by the indicator organism concentrations in the water sample collected from
the corresponding bathing zone and nearest time zone where bathing took place. The
arithmetic mean value was used when exposure occurred exactly between two time zones.
This assignment method was identical to the one used in the original UK study (Kay et al
1994). In Germany, exposure levels were calculated using a hypothetical arithmetic mean
concentration assuming 10 individual minutes of exposure, with the exposure for each minute
calculated from the two nearest estimations of indicator organism level (Wiedenmann et al
2006).
A2.2.2.4

Disease symptoms

The main outcome of interest was self-reported GI either at 1 week or 3 weeks after the trial
day. GI was defined as any case of diarrhoea or vomiting, or any case of indigestion or nausea
accompanied by fever (see (a) to (d) below). Any participants that suffered from chronic
bowel problems or reported GI symptoms on the trial day were excluded from the analysis.
Both the GI definition and the exclusion criteria were adopted from the original UK study
(Kay et al 1994).
Definition of GI
Reported at either 1wk or 3wks post-exposure:
a) Diarrhoea
b) Vomiting
c) Nausea accompanied by fever
d) Indigestion accompanied by fever
A2.2.2.5

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using the statistical software Stata 10 installed with the latest
meta-analysis package (StataCorp 2008). Summary odds ratios were estimated for each model
and results were displayed graphically through forest plots. In a forest plot the contribution of
each study to the model, i.e. its weight, is reflected by the area of the grey box whose centre
represents the effect size estimated from that study. The 95% CI are shown by the extents of
the line and ends with an arrow if beyond the scale of the plot. The overall effect is signified
by the diamond whose left and right extremes are the corresponding 95% CI. Forest plots

Appendix 2 Section 2

increase transparency of the analysis by allowing the characteristics (effect size and 95% CI)
and contributions (weighting) of each individual study to be visually examined.
Excess GI risks were examined by comparing disease prevalence in bathers with their nonbathing counterparts, as well as between bathers with different exposure levels. Data were
also stratified by water type and analysed individually as disease rate might differ between
marine and freshwater sites. To take into account the effects of heterogeneity between studies,
random effects modelling was used throughout the analysis.
The presence of any dose-response relationships between enterococci level and GI were also
examined. This was carried out by stratifying the exposure data of the bathers into 4 groups,
using their quartile values as cut-points to eliminate any subjectivity in the selection process.
Marine and freshwater studies were then analysed separately to determine whether GI risk
differs between water type. For this purpose two approaches were taken; 1. Using quartile cutpoints derived from the corresponding water type, and 2. using quartile cut-points of all the
data in the project. The former approach ensured that the subjects were equally distributed in
each group and therefore increased the statistical power, while the latter allowed direct
comparison of the OR in each quartile group as they shared common cut-points.
In addition, exposure data were divided into 20 unit intervals of enterococci to determine the
point where GI risk started to increase. Finally, analyses were carried out using the EC
Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC) guideline levels as cut-points to examine whether the
strictest level (“excellent quality”) would provide better health protection than less stringent
ones, using non-bathers as baseline. The current standards of “excellent quality” for marine
and freshwaters are less than 100 and 200 enterococci/100ml respectively, based upon a 95percentile evaluation. Because the Epibathe project focused on individual exposure levels
rather than the overall standard of the beaches, therefore the 95-percentile was not taken into
account in the analysis.
The effects of potential confounding from non-water related risk factors were also examined.
For this purpose one logistic regression model was created for each trial, and their log odds
ratios and standard errors (SE) controlled for a number of known confounders were
subsequently transferred to the meta-analysis models (see list of confounders controlled for
below 9.e. (a) to (h)). The resultant summary odds ratios were therefore adjusted for
confounding in contrast to the unadjusted crude summary odds ratios.

Exposure data were then stratified into 4 equal groups using the quartile cut-points to examine
the dose-response relationship between exposure and GI. A positive association between GI
and enterococci levels was found. The OR in the adjusted models were 1.18 (95% CI 0.801.74), 1.20 (95% CI 0.83-1.72), 1.34 (95% CI 0.87-2.07), and 1.81 (95% CI 1.08-3.02) for the

control of confounders were slightly higher in the first three quartiles but lower in the 4th
quartile (Table 4). Figure 3 summarises the OR across various quartile groups.

Risk of GI in bathers, stratified by water type

Both marine and freshwater studies showed an increased risk of GI amongst bathers, and
according to the adjusted models the risk was approximately 2-fold higher in marine water
(OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.87) than freshwater sites (OR=1.20, 95% CI 0.88-1.62) (Tables 6 &
7). Forest plots of the studies were displayed in Figure 5.

A2.2.3.2.1.

Stratification using quartile cut-points from either marine or freshwater
studies

When exposure data were stratified into quartiles using cut-points that corresponded to the
relevant water type, results from marine water sites demonstrated a positive dose-response
relationship between GI and exposure. Such association was observed in both the crude and
adjusted models although the actual figures varied (Table 8). The OR in the 1st – 4th quartiles
of the adjusted models were 1.35 (95% CI 0.75-2.45), 1.44 (95% CI 0.87-2.36), 1.47 (95% CI
0.94-2.31), and 2.06 (95% CI 0.84-5.04) respectively (Table 8 & Figure 6). These results were
summarised in Figure 7.
Results from freshwater sites showed some signs of a positive dose-response relationship but
none of the models achieved statistical significance. The OR of the adjusted models were 0.98
(95% CI 0.54-1.76), 1.26 (95% CI 0.74-2.17), 1.15 (95% CI 0.69-1.94), and 1.68 (95% CI
0.82-3.46) for the 1st – 4th quartiles respectively (Table 9 & Figure 8). Figure 9 summarises
the OR across different quartile group.

Stratification using quartile cut-points from all studies

In order to compare the changes in GI risks at different exposure levels between marine and
freshwater studies, a set of common quartile cut-points derived from all exposure data were
used. Neither marine nor freshwater studies showed any strong dose-response relationship
between GI and exposure level, although results from the former showed a significantly
increased risk at the third quartile (Tables 10 & 11, Figures 10 & 11). Both sets of results are
summarised in Figure 12.

Risk of GI in bathers using the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cutpoint

An increased risk of GI was observed in both marine and freshwater sites when bathers were
exposed to enterococci concentrations higher than the level that approximately resembled the
2006/7/EC “excellent quality” criteria, i.e. 100 and 200 enterococci/100ml for marine water
and freshwater respectively. In marine water sites, compared with non-bathers, the risk of GI
was 32% higher (OR=1.32, 95% CI 0.95-1.83) when bathing took place in water with less
than 100 enterococci/100ml, but increased to 119% (OR=2.19, 95% CI 0.90-5.34) of nonbathers once beyond that level (Table 12 & Figure 13). In freshwater sites the risk of GI was
23% (OR=1.23, 95% CI 0.90-1.70) higher when bathers were exposed to water with less than
200 enterococci/100ml compared with non-bathers, but increased to 144% (OR=2.44, 95% CI
1.09-5.45) when that level was exceeded (Table 13 & Figure 14).

Discussion

Results obtained from meta-analyses showed that recreational bathing in European waters was
associated with an increased risk of GI. Furthermore, there was also evidence of a doseresponse relationship between exposure level and GI risk; compared with non-bathers the risk
was slightly increased at lower enterococci concentrations but became more significant at
higher concentrations despite still being within the limits of the current guideline levels.
Analysis of the combined data showed that a threshold point occurred at 100
enterococci/100ml where the risk of GI became statistically significant.
When results were stratified by water type, freshwater sites showed lower risks as well as a
weaker dose-response relationship between GI and exposure than marine water studies.
However, the positive dose-response relationship seen in marine water studies was lost when
the exposure group was stratified using the overall quartile values as cut-points. This was
probably due to reduced statistical power caused by the uneven number of subjects assigned
to each group. Nonetheless the results showed that recreational bathing in marine waters was
associated with higher GI risk than freshwater, and that the threshold point was also
positioned at a lower exposure level. Such difference may be due to the shorter lifespan of
enterococci than the pathogens in marine water. Hanes and Fragala (1964) have shown that
under laboratory condition the T90 (i.e. the time it takes for 90% of the indicator organism to
die-off) of enterococci in marine and freshwater were 47hrs and 71hrs respectively. Thus,

Appendix 2 Section 2

Page 26 of 29



considering the hypothetical situation of a similar concentration of a pathogen in fresh and
marine waters, the accompanying level of enterococci measured in marine waters, would be
approximately half that measured in freshwaters. Currently the EC Bathing Water Directive
adopts a 2:1 ratio for faecal indicator organism count in fresh versus marine water. Based on
results from the crude model, the risk of GI amongst bathers in marine water sites was
approximately 2-fold higher than freshwater sites, and the difference only changed slightly
when non-water related confounding factors were taken into account. These findings
supported the 2:1 ratio adopted by the Directive, and also pointed out that some of the
difference could be due to non-water related confounding factors, which could vary from site
to site. Nevertheless, it is without doubt that in general higher GI rates were associated with
marine water than freshwater at identical enterococci concentrations.
For ethical reasons all chosen study sites had to be compliant with the EC bathing water
standards, and with the low enterococci counts the study was unable to examine the health
effects of exposures to more polluted water. However, fluctuation in enterococci levels was
observed in Epibathe and in several occasions exceeded the minimum compliant level. There
were insufficient data for robust statistical analysis to examine the health impact experienced
by these bathers. Based on previous observations that GI was positively associated with
enterococci level, such short-term variation could result in high exposures and increased the
risk of GI even in beaches with excellent water quality.
When using a proxy of the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cut-point, it appeared that
by maintaining enterococci level to the strictest strata the risk of GI would be reduced.
However, there was still a moderate increase in risk even when bathers were exposed to
waters with excellent quality. This indicated that there will be a certain level of health risk
associated with recreational bathing. Findings from these analyses should be interpreted with
caution because the current guideline levels are based upon a 95-percentile evaluation,
meaning at least 95% of the samples taken from a single beach must be below the limit in
order to achieve an “excellent quality” rating. This was not applicable to the Epibathe study as
exposures at person-level rather than ecological-level were the main focus of the research.
Therefore this part of the analysis could only be regarded as an approximation of the current
bathing water standards.
Despite positive findings most meta-analysis models had failed to achieve statistical
significance. A number of factors might have contributed to this, including low enterococci
concentrations in most water samples, low GI attack rates, and the relatively small number of
subjects in each group once stratified into various exposure levels. The original UK studies,
in which the other Epibathe studies were based on, were carried out back in the early 1990s.
At that time water quality was poorer and background disease rates were higher relative to
current European norms, therefore the number of volunteers required to achieve the same
statistical power was underestimated in Hungary and Spain. In retrospect, the bather/nonbather ratio of 1:1 could have been changed to increase the statistical power of all metaanalysis models when the bathers were stratified into different groups.
Thus far Epibathe had demonstrated the positive relationship between GI and bathing water
exposures. However, the possible difference in terms of immunity levels between local and
tourist bathers meant that the latter group may be more vulnerable to GI caused by bathing
water that otherwise had little effects on the local residents. According to Cabelli who carried

Appendix 2 Section 2

Page 27 of 29



out a study in 3 beaches in Alexandria, Egypt, the risk of developing GI symptoms was found
to be significantly higher amongst visiting bathers from Cairo than local residents (Cabelli
1983). Although the enterococci levels recorded were far beyond the current European
standards, the author did demonstrate that tourists were more susceptible to GI when exposed
to unfamiliar bathing waters. Provided that it is financially and logically feasible, a pilot study
could be carried out to invite British volunteers to an overseas study site along with an equal
number of local residents for a “weekend trial”. Local and tourist bathers could be matched to
ensure similar exposure level and other characteristics for direct comparisons in disease risks
between groups.
As a randomised-controlled trial Epibathe to certain extent might have suffered from recall
bias because the volunteers were not “blinded” by their exposure status. As a result those who
suffered from GI after bathing, regardless of whether or not it was caused by the bathing
itself, were more likely to remember details of exposures and the development of symptoms
considered to be related to bathing. While this might be true when comparing GI amongst
bathers and non-bathers, the volunteers were not aware of their exposure level in terms of
enterococci concentrations. Therefore the dose-response effects observed could not have been
biased. The effects of confounding by non-water related factors seemed to play a minor role in
determining the OR, as demonstrated by the small difference in the OR between most crude
and adjusted models.
Although the study sites were considered as representative of the average European bathing
sites, some differences between sites could occur such as current, temperature, precipitation,
and the surrounding environment etc. Therefore, more sites from different European countries
should be surveyed in order to increase the representative nature of Epibathe in evaluating the
current EC Bathing Water Directive.
The next phase of statistical analysis will be to investigate the risks of other infections
including AFRI (acute febrile respiratory illnesses), and ailments of the ears, eyes, and skin.
The methodology being used will be the same although certain exclusion criteria and
confounders will differ depending on the outcome of interest. Furthermore, the data will be
reanalysed using E.coli as the indicator organism.

Excess risk of gastroenteritis (GI) was found in bathers compared with nonbathers, but did not achieve statistical significance.
Although exposure took place in water classified as “excellent quality”
(approximation to the current bathing water standards), GI risks in those bathers
were still higher compared with non-bathers.
Risk of GI was found to be associated with E. coli concentrations in water when
bathers were stratified into various groups according to exposure levels.
However, there was a lack of a consistently observed increase in risks as the
exposure increased.
Results suggested that E. coli might be a more appropriate indicator for predicting
risk of GI in fresh recreational bathing waters than enterococci.

A2.3.1

Background

This report summarises the key epidemiological findings from the German and Hungarian
studies of the Epibathe Project, on the risks of gastroenteritis (GI) from exposures to
European fresh bathing waters. The statistical technique used was meta-analysis, with E. coli
as faecal indicator organism.

A2.3.2

Methods

A description of the project and the analytical methods were detailed in Appendix 2 Section 2.
E. coli levels in water samples collected at the trials were measured by microtitre plate
method (EC96wells) (ISO 9308-3:1998).

A2.3.3

Results

Data from 4,200 volunteers were available in the final dataset (Table 1) after excluding 149
entries either because they matched the exclusion criteria (n=135) or due to missing data
(n=14) (Box 1).

Risk of GI in bathers

Comparing all bathers with non-bathers, the summary odds ratio (subsequently referred to as
OR) of GI for bathers was 1.25 (95% CI 0.94-1.65) and after adjusting for confounders the
OR reduced slightly to 1.20 (95% CI 0.88-1.62) (Table 2). This represented a 20% excess risk
of GI in bathers. Results of the adjusted model were summarised by a forest plot in Figure 1.

In order to examine the association between E. coli concentration in water and GI, bathers
were stratified into 4 equal groups based on the quartile cut-points of the exposure levels of all
bathers. There was a partial dose-response relationship between GI and increasing levels of E.
coli, with the a statistically significant OR in the 4th quartile (table 3). The OR in the adjusted
models were 0.74 (95% CI 0.40-1.36), 1.29 (95% CI 0.73-2.30), 1.19 (95% CI 0.74-1.92), and
1.76 (95% CI 1.04-2.98) for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile respectively (Figure 2). Figure 3

Risk of GI in bathers using the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cutpoint

An increased risk of GI was observed in bathers that were exposed to E. coli concentrations
higher than the level that, broadly speaking, represents the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality”
criteria (<500 E. coli /100ml). The risk of GI was 9% (OR=1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.53) higher
when bathers were exposed to water with less than 500 E. coli /100ml compared with nonbathers, but increased to 119% (OR=2.19, 95% CI 1.21-3.97) when that level was exceeded
(Table 5 & Figure 5).

Forest plots showing OR of GI in bathers exposed to <500 and ≥500 E. coli
/100ml in marine water studies. Studies with no subjects in the
corresponding group were allocated to the bottom and marked as
“excluded”. Results were obtained from random effects models and were
adjusted for confounders.

Conclusion

This report examined the association between risk of GI and E. coli concentrations in
European fresh bathing waters. Results showed an increased risk of GI in bathers compared
with non-bathers but the association was not statistically significant. When bathers were
stratified into different groups according to their exposure levels, there was an overall increase
in GI risk at higher levels. However there was no consistent increase in risks as subjects were
exposed to water at higher concentrations of E. coli.
When using a proxy of the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cut-point, it appeared that
by maintaining E. coli level to the strictest strata the risk of GI would be reduced, although the
risk associated with exposures at that level was still moderately higher than in non-bathers.
This indicated that recreational bathing would inevitably involve a certain level of health
risks. The effect of bathing when E. coli was at the “good quality” level (i.e. 1,000
E. coli/100ml) could not be examined due to the lack of data points beyond that level in the
freshwater studies.
Due to the lack of E. coli data from the original UK study this report does not assess the
suitability of E. coli as a faecal indicator for marine waters. Nevertheless, with the absence of
any dose-response relationships between the likelihood of GI illness and enterococci
concentrations in freshwater, these results from Epibathe suggested that E. coli is more likely
to be a useful indicator organism than enterococci in predicting GI illnesses associated with
exposures to fresh recreational waters.

Risks were higher amongst bathers in all 4 non-enteric illnesses.
There was no strong evidence of any positive dose-response relationships between
non-enteric illnesses and exposure levels.
Nonetheless disease risks were loosely higher at higher enterococci levels.
For marine water studies, the risks of all 4 illnesses were higher amongst bathers
compared with non-bathers.
For freshwater studies, the risks of all illnesses except AFRI were higher in the
bathing group.
The risk of disease was always higher in marine water sites than freshwater sites,
with the exception of skin ailments.
When using a proxy of the EC Bathing Water Directive 2006/7/EC “excellent
quality” level as cut-point, the health risks were often greater when the most
stringent enterococcal levels were exceeded.

Background

This report summarises the key epidemiological findings from the Epibathe Project on the risks
of 4 non-enteric diseases from exposures to European bathing waters. The statistical technique
used was meta-analysis with enterococci as the exposure measure.

Methods

A description of the project and the analytical methods were detailed above: i.e. in Appendix 2
Section 2.
A2.4.2.1

Disease symptoms

The main outcomes of interest were self-reported acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI), ear
ailments, eye ailments, and skin ailments that occurred either at 1 week or 3 weeks after the trial
day. Box 1 shows the definition of the illnesses.
Information on the background and current health status of the participants were collected prior
to the trial. Those who suffered from chronic illnesses or reported symptoms that were related to

Risk of non-enteric illnesses in bathers, stratified by water type

Both marine and freshwater studies suggested an increased risk of non-enteric illnesses amongst
bathers with the exception of AFRI in freshwater (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.44-1.54). When
comparing disease risks between marine and freshwater sites, the health risks were higher in
marine water for AFRI, ear, and eye ailments (Tables 4 and 5), but not for skin ailments.

Analysis was only carried out for skin ailments due to insufficient number of cases for the other
illnesses. There were no obvious dose-response relationships observed in either marine or
freshwater sites between skin ailments and exposure levels (Tables 6 and 7). However, results
from freshwater studies suggested a threshold effect in which the risk of skin ailment increased
significantly as soon as exposure took place, and this appeared to be independent of the water
enterococci level.

Stratification using quartile cut-points from all studies

In order to compare the changes in disease risks at different exposure levels between marine and
freshwater studies, a set of common quartile cut-points derived from all exposure data was used
(Table 8 & 9). Analysis was only carried out for skin ailments due to insufficient number of
cases for the other illnesses. In freshwater studies there was a sudden increase in the risk of skin
ailments as soon as exposure took place, which appeared to be independent to the level of
enterococci in water.

Increased risks for most non-enteric illnesses were observed in both marine (Table 10) and
freshwater sites (Table 11) when bathers were exposed to enterococci concentrations higher than
the level that approximately resembled the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” criteria, i.e. 100 and

Conclusions

1. Risks were higher amongst bathers for all 4 non-enteric illnesses, with ear ailments

2. When stratified into quartile groups, an overall increase in disease risks as exposure level
increased was observed.
3. For ear ailments, the OR peaked once exposure had taken place and showed little
relationship with the dosage.
4. For marine water studies, the risks of all 4 illnesses were higher amongst bathers
compared with non-bathers, with AFRI (OR=1.56) and ear ailments (OR=3.54) reaching
statistical significance.

5. For freshwater studies, the risks of all illnesses except AFRI were higher in the bathing
group. However, only skin ailments reached statistical significance (OR=2.39).
6. Disease risks were always higher in marine water sites than freshwater sites, with the
exception of skin ailments (OR 1.12 and 2.39 respectively).
7. When using a proxy of the 2006/7/EC “excellent quality” level as cut-point, the health
risks were often greater when the most stringent bacterial level (100 enterococci/100ml
for marine and 200 enterococci/100ml for freshwaters) was exceeded.

The effects of non-water related risk factors on
gastroenteritis
H.C. Au-Yeung, D.Rh. Thomas, R.L. Salmon
Epibathe Partner 5, National Public Health Service (NPHS)

Key findings:
a. The risk of GI associated with the consumption of high risk foods (hamburgers /
sandwiches / takeaways) was 16%, after taking into account of other factors.
b. This was approximately equivalent to the GI risk of exposing to 14
enterococci/100ml in the water.
c. Since the consumption of those foods is common in Europe, the risk of GI from
bathing in water with less than 14 enterococci/100ml should be negligible.
d. The risk of GI was markedly increased when cases of GI were reported in the
subjects’ households.
e. However, this observation was based on less than half of the studies in Epibathe.

A2.5.1

Objectives

To estimate the effects of two separate non-water related risk factors on gastroenteritis (GI)
using data from all the studies in Epibathe. These factors included the consumption of “high
risk foods”, and the occurrence of gastroenteritis episodes in the subject’s household.
A2.5.2

Methods

The effects of two non-water related risk factors were examined:
i.

whether or not the subject had consumed any “high risk foods” (sandwiches /
hamburgers / takeaways) 3 days before or 7 days after the trial day; and

ii.

whether or not cases of GI were reported in the subject’s household that preceded the
subject’s own illness within 3 weeks after the trial day.

Both definitions were derived from the original UK study (Kay et al 1994).

Appendix 2 Section 5

Page 1 of 4



Logistic regression modelling was carried out for each individual study with GI as the
dependent variable, and “high risk foods” and household GI as the independent variable of
interest. A number of non-water related factors were also included in the model. When
identical results were given by all study subjects for the same variable of interest (e.g. all
subjects from a single trial had consumed “high risk foods”), or when a variable predicted
failure perfectly (e.g. nil cases of GI under that variable), then the variable would
automatically be dropped by the regression model and subsequently excluded from metaanalysis. Once the models were completed, the logOR and SE logOR values for the variable
that concerned the consumption of “high risk foods” and the presence of GI in the household
were transferred to Stata and individually analysed by meta-analysis. A summary odds ratio
(OR) for GI was calculated from each meta-analysis model, which showed the difference in
disease risk in subjects who were exposed to one of the non-water related risk factors versus
those who did not (i.e. baseline).
Variables included in the logistic regression models.

Results

Meta-analysis models showed that GI risk was 16% (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.86-1.56) higher in
subjects who reported to have consumed one or more types of “high risk food”. On the other
hand, the risk of GI was significantly higher in subjects who reported cases of GI in the
household that preceded the subject’s own illness (OR 5.82, 95% CI 2.87-11.78). Forest plots
of the models are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Table 1 shows the OR of GI in various exposure groups stratified by their enterococci quartile
cut-points, which were derived from another meta-analysis model built previously. In the
model a positive dose-response relationship between GI and exposure level was seen. When
comparing these figures with those presented in this report, the risk of gastroenteritis
associated with the consumption of “high risk foods” was approximately equivalent to the risk
corresponding to an exposure level of just below 14 enterococci/100ml. In contrast, the
presence of GI in household had huge effect on the risk of GI amongst the Epibathe subjects
which far exceeded the OR associated with the highest exposure titre in the study.

Conclusions

The risk of GI associated with the consumption of “high risk foods” in Epibathe was low.
With an OR of 1.16 it was approximately equivalent to an exposure level of 14
enterococci/100ml. In theory, below that exposure level the risk of GI associated with water
bathing would be negligible, since the consumption of hamburgers, sandwiches, and
takeaways are common in Europe.
Having GI in the household preceding illness experienced by the subjects increased the risk of
GI markedly in the study subjects and surpassed the effects of bathing. However, this must be
interpreted with caution since the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small
(8 out of 17).
