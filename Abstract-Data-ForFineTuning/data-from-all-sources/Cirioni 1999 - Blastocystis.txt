Abstract. The pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis
is extensively debated in the medical literature.
Therefore, we did a prevalence study to investigate
the association between the presence of several intestinal parasites and gastrointestinal symptoms in
diverse patient cohorts. The study population consisted of 1216 adults, including immunocompromised
patients, institutionalized psychiatric or elder subjects, immigrants from developing countries, travellers to developing tropical countries and controls.
Several variables for each risk group were considered.
Stools specimens, collected in triplicate, were processed by the same technicians. Clinical data about
each subject were provided by standardized questionnaires. The presence of gastrointestinal symp-

toms were related to the presence of any parasite. In
addition, on the basis of microbiological results, ®ve
subgroups of subjects were evaluated. The results
showed a high prevalence of parasites in all the risk
groups. Immunocompromised status, recent arrival
from developing countries and the presence of behavioural aberrations were signi®cantly related to
presence of parasites. B. hominis was the parasite
most frequently detected in each studied group.
B. hominis showed a signi®cant correlation with
gastrointestinal symptoms only when detected in the
group including subjects with a severe immunodepression. Immunodepression seems to be a factor
of primary importance of the pathogenic role of
B. hominis.

Introduction

Methods

Blastocystis hominis, an eukariotic organism frequently found in the intestinal tract of humans and
many other animals, has long been described as a
harmless intestinal yeast or protozoa, until recently it
has been classi®ed into the group of Stramenopiles
(diatoms, oomycetes, labyrinthulids, brown algae and
chrysophytes) by analyzing the rRNA genes [1±3].
Controversy surrounds its pathogenicity: several researchers consider it a commensal organism, others
believe it is pathogenic although the question of
pathogenicity is unsettled [4±6]. Limitations of previous studies included lack of properly controlled
prospective investigations, lack of predetermined
de®nition of symptoms, lack of comprehensive bacteriology to rule out other etiologies of diarrhoea, lack
of quantitative data on the concentration of B. hominis, and failure to show an immune or histopathological response [7, 8]. Recent reports described there
are probably pathogenic and non-pathogenic types of
B. hominis [9]. This study was undertaken to investigate the carrier rate of B. hominis in selected groups of
subjects and its association with gastrointestinal
symptoms.

The study population consisted of ®ve patient cohorts
and control group enrolled between September 1994
and July 1997. The ®rst cohort included 238 adults
(mean age 64.7 years, 112 males and 126 females)
housed in four Italian residential facilities for the
psychiatric diseases. The second included 110 elder
individuals (mean age 68.3 years, 57 females and 53
males) housed in an Italian residential centre. The
third cohort included 208 HIV-positive immunocompromised patients (mean age 34.5 years, 121
males and 87 females). The fourth cohort included
146 immigrants from developing countries (mean age
38.8 years, 82 males and 64 females). The ®fth cohort
included 409 subjects (mean age 38.9 years, 241 males
and 168 females) who had a history of travel (about
two weeks) from Italy to developing tropical countries within the 1-month period before being tested.
The control group included 105 HIV-negative Italian
patients (mean age 54.2 years, 53 males and 51 females) without a history of travel from Italy to developing tropical countries within 1-month period
before being tested and without underlying psychiatric diseases who had admitted to our department.

Stools were collected in triplicate from each subject. Initially a direct smear examination from fresh
fecal specimens was performed. Specimens were then
concentrated by formalin-ethylacetate technique
using screw cap vials containing 10 ml of ®xative
solution and multiple slides were prepared from each
stool sample. A direct examination by saline wet
mounts were made mixing a small volume of pellet
with a drop of physiological saline on a glass microscope slide. Iodine wet mounts were prepared by
adding 50 ll of pellet to a drop of Lugol's iodine.
These wet mounts were microsocpically screened
initially by using a low-power (10´) objective and
then using a high-power (40´) objective of a light
microscope. Smears were also dried, ®xed in methanol for 10 min, stained by a modi®ed acid fast
method and then examined for the presence of
Cryptosporidium spp. and other coccidia. Besides
Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia were
detected by an immuno¯uorescent assay. As an additional procedure, the modi®ed trichrome staining
method for microsporidia was used. Contemporaneusly, a `comprehensive' microbiological investigation
(standard
culture,
biochemical
techniques, viral detection and pathogenic E. coli
identi®cation) were performed to rule out Salmonella
spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio
spp., Campylobacter jejuni, pathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp., Adenoviruses, Rotaviruses, and Enteroviruses. Clinical data about each subject have been
provided by standardized questionnaires.
Statistical analyses for discrete variables were done
using a two-tailed v2 (Yates's corrected); a p-value of
O0:05 was considered as signi®cant.
Results
B. hominis was found in the stools of 165 (13.6%) of
1216 subjects (Table 1). Among the 1111 subjects of
the ®ve patient cohorts and the 105 controls there
were no signi®cant dierences with respect to age, sex
and travel history between those who had B. hominis
detected and those who did not. On the contrary,
signi®cant dierences were revealed with respect to
residential status. Actually, the highest prevalence
was found in the cohort of the institutionalized psychiatric patients: B. hominis was recovered in the fecal
samples from 76 (31.9%) out of 238 individuals.
However, the prevalence of B. hominis was similar
among 110 elder individuals (13.6%), 208 HIV-positive patients (13.5%), and 146 immigrants from developing countries (19.2%). Unexpectedly, the group
of the travelers from Italy to developing tropical
countries showed lower B. hominis prevalence (2.9%)
than the control group (5.7%). Overall, in 45 individuals B. hominis was found in conjunction with
other organisms: in 42 cases it was associated with
intestinal protozoa, in 2 cases with Salmonella ent-

erica subsp. enterica, and in 1 case with Aeromonas
hydrophila. In 33 individuals it was associated with
nonpathogenic protozoa (Entamoeba coli, 11 cases;
Endolimax nana, 6 cases; Iodamoeba buÈtschlii, 5 cases;
Enteromonas hominis, 4 cases; Chilomastix mesnili, 4
cases; Retortamonas intestinalis, 3 cases), while in 9
individuals it was associated with pathogenic parasites (G. lamblia, 7 cases; C. parvum, one case; Trichuris trichiura, one case). Nevertheless, most of the
individuals with B. hominis colonization did not have
concurrent parasites in stools specimens. In 23 of the
165 B. hominis carriers, the average number of organisms was equal or exceeded 5 per 400 ®eld (range,
5 to 25; average, 7). B. hominis represented the only
intestinal parasite in 16 of these 23 subjects.
A total of 190 of these 1216 subjects were symptomatic, and B. hominis represented the only intestinal organism in 18 of these symptomatic patients
(Table 2). The major symptoms in these 18 patients
were abdominal pain (12 patients), mild diarrhoea (11
patients aected by three to six bowel movements
daily), fatigue (9 patients), anorexia (9 patients), and
nausea (8 patients). Nevertheless, there were no signi®cant dierences in prevalence of symptoms between those subjects who had B. hominis, alone or in
association with other organisms, in their stools and
those who did not, with the exception of the immunocompromised patients. The HIV-positive patients
were divided on the basis of the CD4+ cell count:
114 subjects (54.8%) had a CD4+ cell count
<200 ´ 106/l, while 94 (45.2%) had a CD4+ cell
count between 200 and 500 ´ 106/l. Successively, data
from any risk group were analyzed by microbiological result (A: subjects with no parasite detected; B:
subjects positive for B. hominis only; C: subjects
positive for B. hominis and pathogenic organisms; D:
subjects positive for B. hominis and nonpathogenic
organisms). B. hominis in combination with intestinal
pathogens (subgroup C) resulted signi®cantly associated with presence of symptoms. On the contrary
there was no signi®cant association with presence of
symptoms among the subjects of the subgroups B and
D, with the exception, within the subgroup B, of the
signi®cant association between detection of B. hominis and presence of symptoms in the patients with
CD4+ cell count <200 ´ 106/l. Although the number of symptomatic B. hominis carriers within subgroup B was small (18 individuals out of 123), our
data suggested that symptomatic carriers were more
likely than symptom-free individuals to have P5
B. hominis organisms per ®eld: 7(38.9%) out of 18
cases versus 9 (8.6%) out of 105 cases.
Discussion
B. hominis is often observed in routine stool examination from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Numerous reports have been published that

arm and deny the pathogenic signi®cance of this
organism. In this study, we determined the prevalence
of B. hominis in the stools of 1216 subjects. Our data
showed a high prevalence of B. hominis in diverse
patient cohorts: a ®nding that con®rms the results of
several previous reports [5±8, 10, 11].
Our results showed a statistically signi®cant association between presence of B. hominis and the presence of symptoms only among the severely
immunocompromised individuals with a CD4+ cell
count <200 ´ 106/l. Pathogenic potential of B. hominis might depend on host factors such as lowered
immunity or on disturbances of gastrointestinal
function or ¯ora. Besides, apart from symptomatic
courses of infection due to large number of parasites,
pathological eects might depend on toxic-allergic
action of B. hominis [12]. Nevertheless, no toxin elaboration has been demonstrated and, therefore, no
puri®ed-toxin studies have been reported to date.
Recent investigations have identi®ed two variants of
B. hominis on the basis of dierent polypeptide patterns and DNA polymorphisms [13, 14]. Other authors
demonstrated that there are at least 5±7 subgroups of

B. hominis, but probably no `pathogenic' and `nonpathogenic' subspecies of this organism. It was showed
also that the human isolates even dier more amongst
themselves than they dier from Guinea pig sequences
in rRNA genes [15, 16]. These ®ndings may indicate
the possibility of intraspeci®c variation of the organism, the existence of zoonotic and human strains, and
the possibility that virulence factors of the parasite are
strain speci®c, which may explain why some subjects
are symptomatic and others are not. Actually, the
correlation between the occurrence of B. hominis and
gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV-seropositive individuals is still debated and con¯icting evidence exists
as to whether the organism should also be included
among the infectious agents capable of causing HIVrelated diarrhoea [11, 17, 18]. We found the highest
prevalence of the organism in the group of the institutionalized psychiatric patients, but it was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms: in this cohort
of individuals the presence of B. hominis is probably
related to the presence of behavioral aberrations and
fecal contamination of the environment, therefore the
organism might be considered as an environmental

indicator. The prevalence of B. hominis was lower and
similar among elder individuals, HIV-positive patients
and immigrants from developing countries. Interestingly, the lowest prevalence of B. hominis was found in
the group of the travellers from Italy to developing
tropical countries. These ®ndings are controversial in
relation to several studies previously performed on
travellers [4, 19, 20]. This could probably due to a
correct counselling activity realized with a travel information service by the Centre for traveller's disease
prevention of the Institute of Infectious Disease and
Public Health of the University of Ancona to whom
the majority of the travellers referred. Our data show
the association of B. hominis and symptoms only in
severely immunosuppressed patients, although this
conclusion is based on a small number of individuals.
Besides, it is well known that, in these patients, gastrointestinal symptoms may be caused by medications
such as antibiotics and antiretrovirals. Nevertheless in
most of our cases the presence of B. hominis was not
associated with gastrointestinal symptoms: we believe
that occasionally the organism may become an opportunistic pathogen and may contribute to illness as a
part of a larger picture.
