Abstract. Diarrheal diseases remain a signiﬁcant contributor to the global burden of disease. Climate change may
increase their incidence by altering the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens through changes in rainfall patterns. To
assess potential impacts of future changes in rainfall patterns, we analyzed 33,927 cases of diarrhea across all Ministry of
Health clinical facilities in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, for a 24-month period from 2013 to 2014, using mixed-effects
Poisson regression. We assessed the association between the incidence of diarrheal diseases and heavy rainfall events
(HREs) and antecedent rainfall conditions. In rural areas, we found no signiﬁcant associations between HREs and
incidence. In urban areas, dry antecedent conditions were associated with higher incidence than wet conditions. In
addition, HREs with dry antecedent conditions were associated with elevated incidence by up to 1.35 (incidence rate ratio,
95% CI: 1.14–1.60) times compared with similar conditions without HREs. These patterns may be driven by accumulation
of fecal contamination during dry periods, followed by a ﬂushing effect during HREs. This phenomenon is more important
in dense urban environments with more impervious surfaces. These ﬁndings suggest that projected increases in rainfall
variability and HREs may increase diarrhea burden in urban regions, which are rapidly expanding globally.

household water treatment.21 In addition, several other studies
have found an association between rainfall following a dry period and elevated rates of diarrhea.10 The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change estimates an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought and HREs
due to changes in the water cycle from climate change.22
Therefore, it is critical to disentangle the role of rainfall in the
epidemiology of diarrheal diseases such that appropriate policies and interventions can be designed to mitigate risk of diarrheal disease morbidity and mortality under current and future
climate conditions.
Given that both rainfall extremes may be associated with
increased risk for diarrheal diseases, it is important to consider
the factors that contribute to a community’s vulnerability and
coping capacity. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation
is core to a community’s ability to reduce the burden of diarrheal diseases, as these factors directly affect the transmission of enteric pathogens.23,24 There are large gaps across
the urban–rural gradient in access to safe drinking water and
sanitation as well as other risk factors for diarrheal diseases
such as education.25,26 It is therefore important to consider
how meteorological factors such as rainfall might differentially
affect urban compared with rural areas.
Previous studies have analyzed the association of heavy or
low rainfall with diarrheal diseases within speciﬁc contexts10
or contextualized the relationship of HREs within wet or dry
seasonal periods,21 but we are not familiar with studies that
have speciﬁcally examined the inﬂuence of HREs within urban
versus rural contexts. In this study, we have analyzed 33,927
cases of diarrheal diseases in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador,
over a 2-year period to assess how the relationship between
HREs and diarrhea is modiﬁed by antecedent rainfall conditions in urban versus rural contexts.

INTRODUCTION
Diarrheal diseases remain a signiﬁcant cause of mortality
and morbidity, causing more than 81.0 million disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) in 2017. Importantly, children
younger than 5 years bear a disproportionate amount of this
burden (48.3 million DALYs (59.6%) and more than 533,000
deaths).1,2 In addition to causing acute diarrhea, enteric
pathogens have been linked to long-term health outcomes
such as child growth failure.3–6 The incidence of diarrheal
diseases is expected to increase with climate change.7,8
Considering the large burden of disease associated with diarrhea, it is critical to understand the role of climatic drivers in
the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases, and social factors that
may affect this burden.9
Rainfall and temperature are major environmental factors
linked to the incidence of diarrheal diseases.10,11 Increases in
temperatures have been associated with increases in the incidence of all-cause and bacterial diarrhea. The relationship
between temperature and diarrhea has received more attention than the relationship between rainfall and diarrhea,10,12 in
part because the latter is more complex.12,13 Low rainfall and
drought conditions can lead to water scarcity, lower water
quality, and increased risk for diarrheal diseases.13 For example, studies in Bangladesh14 and the Paciﬁc Islands15 have
documented associations between low rainfall and diarrheal
diseases. On the other hand, high rainfall and ﬂooding may
ﬂush enteric pathogens into waterways used for drinking
water, leading to greater exposure and in turn higher risk of
diarrhea, as seen in North America,16,17 Bangladesh,18,19 and
Mozambique.20 Previous studies have demonstrated the risk
for diarrhea at both ends of rainfall extremes, and the reported
measures of association vary widely. In a previous study in
Esmeraldas Province, we found that the relationship between
heavy rainfall events (HREs) and diarrhea incidence was
modiﬁed by both antecedent rainfall conditions and the type of

Ministry of Health from January 8, 2013 to December 31, 2014.
The records comprised all data from this time period across
Esmeraldas Province, collected from the seven cantons and
63 parishes of the province. Cases were categorized by the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases-10 system.27 Cases
with a primary, secondary, or tertiary ICD-10 code of A09.X,
designating “gastroenteritis of infectious origin,” were considered as cases of diarrhea. In instances where A09X was
only applied to the secondary or tertiary diagnosis, the primary
diagnosis was veriﬁed by expert review to be related to diarrhea (e.g., amebiasis). We categorized cases as younger or
older than 5 years, and the race of the patient as “black,”
“white/other,” “mixed race,” or “indigenous”.
The parishes of Esmeraldas Province were categorized as
urban or rural by the Ecuadorian census bureau (Instituto
Nacional de Estadistica y Census) for 2012.28 Cases of diarrhea were aggregated for each parish by age, gender, and
race categories to generate time series of case data spanning
the observational period and further classiﬁed by urban–rural
status.
Rainfall data. Gridded estimates of total daily rainfall were
obtained for the study period across Esmeraldas Province at a
spatial resolution of 0.25 × 0.25° from the Tropical Rainfall
Measuring Mission 3B42 real time satellite data.29 These estimates were spatially aggregated for each parish using
shapeﬁles of administrative boundaries,28 to generate rainfall
time series for each parish at the daily resolution.
An HRE was deﬁned as any day with rainfall exceeding the
90th percentile of daily rainfall across the study period for a
given parish. Rolling sums were calculated across a window of
the previous 8 weeks for the time series to characterize antecedent rainfall conditions. Sums of rainfall over the previous
8 weeks were considered “wet” antecedent conditions if they
exceeded the 67th percentile, “dry” if below the 33rd percentile, and “medium” otherwise. In this manner, a binomial
variable of the HRE and an ordinal multinomial variable of
antecedent conditions were created across the entire time
series for each parish.
Statistical analyses. We ﬁt mixed-effects Poisson loglinear models to daily counts of cases of diarrheal diseases to
assess the relationship between HREs, antecedent rainfall
conditions, and incidence of diarrheal diseases. Separate
models were run by urban and rural stratiﬁcation. Gender,
age, and racial categorization were used as covariates to
control for potential confounding. In addition, rolling sums
were calculated for the number of cases observed over the
previous 7 days. These sums were used as a covariate to
control for potential temporal confounding. The model also
included random intercepts by parish to control for residual
spatial confounding. In addition, time was included as a linear covariate to control for any potential mean temporal
trends in the data. Heavy rainfall events and antecedent
conditions were included as ﬁxed effects to assess their relationship with diarrheal diseases, as well as an interaction
term between HREs and antecedent conditions to assess
any effect modiﬁcation of the HRE–diarrhea relationship by
antecedent conditions.
To consider lagged effects of rainfall on diarrhea, data on
HREs and antecedent conditions were lagged from one to
14 days because we determined that up to a 14-day lag is
plausible for a case to be detected at a health facility considering infection dynamics, pathogen incubation period, and

time until case detection. The aforementioned regression
models were separately ﬁt for each of the 14 different lags of
rainfall data as well as with 0-lag exposure, and incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) were estimated for each environmental condition
considered.
RESULTS
Most of the 33,927 cases of diarrheal diseases analyzed
comprised children younger than ﬁve years (20,818 [61.4%]),
as expected with diarrheal diseases. The dataset was balanced with respect to sex. The patients were predominantly
identiﬁed as mixed race (21,140 [62.3%]), with black patients
(10,425 [30.7%]) comprising the second highest racial category, reﬂecting the demographic composition of Esmeraldas
Province (Table 1).
Urban areas comprised 40.2% of cases, and rural areas
comprised 59.8%. The urban parish of Esmeraldas (20.5%)
and the rural parishes of Quininde (16.2%) contained the
overall highest number of cases (Table 2, Figure 1). The urban
parish of Esmeraldas is the capital of the province, and
therefore, the high number of cases is related to the large
population residing there.
There was a slight seasonality to the case counts of diarrheal
diseases, with most (59.7%) of the cases occurring between
June and November, which is the dry season in Esmeraldas.
The seasonal pattern was consistent between urban and rural
areas (Figure 2).
The results of our multivariate Poisson log-linear models are
shown in Figure 3. In addition, the complete set of IRRs and
their associated CIs, for all environmental conditions considered across all lags and urban/rural conditions, can be found in
the Supplemental Data. In urban areas, across all lags tested,
wet conditions with or without an HRE were associated with
signiﬁcantly lower case counts of diarrheal disease than dry
antecedent conditions without HREs, and the strength of the
inverse association tended to be weaker and more uncertain
with HREs compared with without. The opposite was observed when considering dry conditions. For 14 of 15 lags
tested, an IRR of > 1 was found when comparing dry conditions with HREs with dry conditions without HREs. These
associations were found to be statistically signiﬁcant for lags
of 11 (IRR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02–1.42) and 14 days (IRR = 1.35,
95% CI: 1.14–1.60).

In rural areas, on the other hand, we found no statistically
signiﬁcant associations between HREs and incidence of diarrhea disease under any lag or either antecedent rainfall
condition considered. The measures of association were very
close to 1.0, with a range of 0.07 (0.97–1.04) under all conditions considered. Wet antecedent conditions with no HRE
trended toward being slightly protective, and associations
across the lags for HREs with dry antecedent conditions had
consistently wider CIs, suggesting a similar trend as in the
urban areas, although not strong enough for HREs to signiﬁcantly affect diarrhea incidence as it did in urban areas.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that HREs and antecedent rainfall
conditions had differential impacts on diarrhea incidence
across urban compared with rural parishes of Esmeraldas

Province, Ecuador. In urban areas, dry conditions were associated with increased risk of diarrhea, and this effect was
exacerbated under the inﬂuence of an HRE, particularly when
it occurred 11 and 14 days before. By contrast, in rural areas,
neither antecedent rainfall conditions nor HREs impacted diarrhea counts.
This is suggestive of a mechanism inﬂuenced by population density and/or the built environment. The impact of
environmental conditions such as rainfall may be less in
rural areas relative to urban areas because of a geographically sparse population distribution and more porous
surfaces. A sparser population allows for fewer transmission events of enteric pathogens than the rates in denser
urban areas. This could cause a lower marginal difference in
rates of diarrhea at the community level because of distal
environmental factors such as rainfall. In addition, urban
areas contain more impervious surface areas allowing for

farther transmission of contamination via runoff after rainfall. Whereas Carlton et al.21 observed an effect on diarrheal
incidence after heavy rainfall in a rural area, the lack of a
signiﬁcant effect in rural areas observed in our study may be
a result of different data sources on diarrhea. In Carlton
et al.,21 diarrhea was measured from household visits which
could have a higher sensitivity to mild cases of diarrhea and
nuanced ﬂuctuations in diarrheal rates, whereas our study
used data from clinics and hospitals which could have a bias
toward a low sensitivity to mild cases and high sensitivity to
severe cases of diarrhea. In addition, there could be unmeasured factors driving the differential effects observed
between urban and rural areas, beyond the built environment or population density.
The incidence of diarrhea in urban areas did not statistically signiﬁcantly differ with HREs versus without HREs in
wet periods. Overall diarrhea incidence were attenuated in
wet periods compared with dry periods, suggesting that
environmental fecal contamination in the community is
regularly ﬂushed out of the system by regular rainfall, and
additional rain to such a system results in a negligible increase in relative risk. With dry antecedent conditions,
HREs were associated with higher incidence of diarrhea,
especially with lags of 11 and 14 days. Dry conditions could
result in water scarcity and/or increased accumulation of

fecal contamination in the environment.13 An HRE in such
conditions could result in mobilization of these accumulated contaminants, resulting in increased transmission to
inhabitants of urban areas, and ultimately elevated counts
of diarrheal diseases. Carlton et al.21 also found a delay in
the effect of HREs, with effects observed at 2-week, but not
1-week, lags, suggesting that the effects of HREs might be
in secondary rather than primary transmission events. This
may further explain why effects are more prominent in dense
urban environments, than rural environments, where lower
rates of transmission may not lead to sufﬁcient buildup of
localized epidemics.
Limitations. The limitations of our study should be considered while interpreting the results. First, we only controlled
for individual-level confounding from age, gender, and racial
characteristics. However, the use of aggregated case counts
for each parish has the advantage in examining time-varying
environmental exposures that the underlying population
serves as its own control across time, such that potential
confounders (e.g. diet and comorbidity) that do not vary at the
same temporal scale as the exposure can be controlled for by
the inclusion of a temporal trend. Second, considering our
case counts were from public hospitals and clinics, there is a
potential for selection bias toward more severe cases of diarrhea. There could be many more cases of diarrheal diseases

that are less severe for which patients did not seek treatment
and therefore were not included in our study. Furthermore,
there is a small risk of confounding if changes in healthcare
seeking due to environmental conditions vary differentially
within urban and rural areas. Considering HREs occurred
throughout the year in the analysis, the relative variation in
healthcare seeking behavior week to week across the year is
unlikely to have a major impact on the observed effects. Third,
we used a satellite product for assessing rainfall exposure,
which may contain a level of error in relation to the rainfall
received on the ground.30 Because of limited access to rain
gauge data across all study sites, the satellite product provided the best spatial coverage for our analysis. In addition,
our analysis used relative measures of exposure, each calculated separately for each parish, limiting the potential for
bias from errors in satellite measurements.
In our study, cases were divided approximately equally
between the genders and disproportionately from ages less
than 5 years, matching the established epidemiological
characteristics of diarrheal diseases. Furthermore, most of
the cases were from black and mestizo populations, as
expected from Esmeraldas Province of Ecuador. This indicated there is minimal selection bias along age, gender, or
race characteristics in our data. The overall temporal trends

in rainfall and case burden were similar across urban and
rural areas, ensuring comparability of urban and rural results
from statistical analyses.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate diarrheal incidence was elevated by up
to 1.35 times (95% CI: 1.14–1.60) with HREs following dry
periods in urban areas of this region of Ecuador. This ﬁnding is
of concern, given anticipated future climate changes that are
expected to increase rainfall variability and the frequency of
HREs in this and other regions.31,32 The occurrence of this
phenomenon in urban, but not rural areas, is of particular
concern, given the increasing global trend of urbanization in
low- and middle-income countries.33 Considering the large
global burden of diarrheal mortality and morbidity, even relatively small percentage increases could have dramatic implications for child health.34,35 Further research is needed to
elucidate the mechanisms driving the relationship between
rainfall and incidence of diarrheal diseases in urban areas and
to inform policy for assessing vulnerability and building coping
mechanisms to ensure that climate change does not reverse
the substantial progress made in recent decades in reducing
the global burden of diarrhea disease.
