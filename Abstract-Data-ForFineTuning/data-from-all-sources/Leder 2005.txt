Abstract
Background and Aim: Previous reports regarding the clinical significance and pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis have been contradictory. The aim of this study was to examine the association between
Blastocystis and gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompetent individuals.
Methods: We monitored over 2800 healthy people for a period of 15 months, and took stool specimens
during both asymptomatic periods and during periods of gastrointestinal symptoms.
Results: After exclusion of individuals who had simultaneous identification of other fecal pathogens, we
compared the proportions of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals positive for Blastocystis and
found no significant difference (P = 0.5). Symptom status did not correlate with parasite abundance. We
found that some individuals were likely to have Blastocystis detected during both asymptomatic and
symptomatic periods, possibly suggesting carriage of the organism.
Conclusion: In conclusion, we found no correlation between clinical symptoms and the presence or
absence of Blastocystis among this healthy cohort.

INTRODUCTION
Blastocystis hominis is an intestinal protozoan parasite
that is frequently identified in human stool specimens.
Despite a surge of information over recent years, data
regarding the role of Blastocystis in causing disease in
humans are still inconclusive and often contradictory,
and its clinical relevance remains controversial.1,2
Whereas some clinical and epidemiological studies
implicate the parasite as a potential pathogen,3–10 others
exonerate it as a cause of intestinal symptoms, particularly in the absence of immunosuppression.11–15 Symptoms previously reported to be associated with
Blastocystis infection include acute or chronic diarrhea,
flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain, and anorexia, but
whether its role is one of association or causation has
not been definitively determined. Symptomless infections are also common and no doubt are frequently
undetected.

We report our findings of Blastocystis in a cohort of
people monitored for a period of 15 months, many of
whom had stool specimens taken both when asymptomatic (baseline specimens) and during periods of gastrointestinal symptoms (study specimens). Comparison
of baseline and study specimens enables examination of
the association of Blastocystis with symptoms in this
cohort.

METHODS
As part of a community-based study assessing the relationship between drinking water quality and human
health effects, we enrolled 600 families with at least two
children 1–15 years of age. The community is supplied
by high quality chlorinated drinking water from protected catchments. The family members were followed

with a weekly health diary for 15 months (68 weeks).
The full methodology and study design have been
reported previously.16 In brief, each participating
household had a nominated member who completed a
weekly questionnaire regarding presence or absence,
duration, and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms.
Fecal specimens were taken from a convenience sample
of participants at baseline. In addition, all participants
were instructed to collect stool samples within 1 week of
onset of gastroenteritis episodes during the study. Gastroenteritis was defined as two or more loose stools, two
or more episodes of vomiting, one loose stool together
with abdominal pain or nausea or vomiting, or one episode of vomiting with abdominal pain or nausea, within
a 24-h period.
Individuals with underlying immunosuppression, a
chronic illness involving frequent episodes of diarrhea,
or those on long-term antibiotic therapy were excluded
from the study.

Methods for identification of fecal pathogens
and detection of blastocystis
Analysis of fecal specimens
Bacterial isolation included culture for Salmonella sp.,
Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., Vibrio
spp., Aeromonas spp., and Plesiomonas spp., and Clostridium difficile culture and toxin. Details of the methodology for testing for bacteria have been described
previously.17 Testing for pathogenic Escherichia coli
(defined as enteropathogenic, enteroaggregative,
enterotoxigenic, enterohemorrhagic, and enteroinvasive
types) was carried out using PCR to detect specific virulence genes.18,19 Rotavirus and Adenovirus 40/41 were
tested using a Rota-Adeno latex kit.20 Testing for
Norwalk-like-virus was carried out using reverse transcription and a hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction,21
although only 703 of the 791 study specimens had sufficient material for analysis. An Evergreen kit was used
to detect parasites.22,23 Specimens were filtered and centrifuged, the supernatant was decanted, and a drop of
sediment was placed on a slide for staining with Modified Iron hematoxylin to enable detection of Blastocystis
and other parasites. Slides were viewed under a micro-

Table 1

scope at ¥54 and ¥100. Results for Blastocystis were
reported as rare (1–2 organism(s) in every 10 hp fields),
few to moderate (1 organism in every 1–5 hp fields), or
abundant (≥ 5 organisms per hp field).

Statistical analysis
The results of baseline stool specimens were compared
between demographic groups using c2 tests. The same
analysis procedure was used for study specimens. Comparisons adjusted for other covariates were performed
using logistic regression with standard errors calculated
using robust standard errors to allow for likely correlation between repeat specimens from the same person.
The software package Stata 8 was used for all analyses.24

RESULTS
There were 600 families included in the study comprising 2811 participants. A total of 173 298 person-weeks
of health diary data were recorded out of a possible
191 148 (91%). Of the 2811 study participants,
648 participants (23%) were aged 5 or less, 928 (33%)
were aged 6–15 years, 895 (32%) were aged 16–39, and
340 (12%) were 40 or older.

Baseline specimens in individuals
asymptomatic for gastroenteritis
Baseline specimens were taken in 1089 individuals
(39%) in the 3-month period prior to the commencement of the study data collection. Of these, 66 (6.1%)
individuals had a specimen positive for Blastocystis, 63
(5.8%) showing no other enteric pathogens (Table 1).
Forty-two people (64%) with Blastocystis identified at
baseline were male and the age range was 1–49 (mean:
18.9, median: 11 years). Males were more likely than
females to have had a positive specimen (7.8% vs 4.4%,
respectively, P = 0.02). While positive tests were also
more common among young people under 16 years of
age than adults (7.0% vs 4.9%, respectively), this could
have been a chance finding (P = 0.15).

Study specimens in individuals with
symptoms of gastroenteritis
Of the 1407 individuals who experienced gastroenteritis at least once during the 15 month observation
period, 535 individuals (38%) submitted one or more
fecal specimens (range of 1–10 specimens per person).
Of symptomatic individuals who submitted at least one
fecal sample, 47 people were found to have Blastocystis
in their stool (8.8%) (Table 1), of whom 23 (49%)
were male. The age range for those with Blastocystis
was 1–44 (mean: 15.1, median: 8 years). Neither the
proportion of positive specimens by age or gender differed from the age and sex distribution of the group
submitting study specimens (P = 0.62, P = 0.98,
respectively).
Of the 47 people with symptoms and Blastocystis in
their stool (7 of whom had Blastocystis identified more
than once), 11 individuals had another pathogen(s)
identified concurrently with Blastocystis which could
have caused or contributed to symptoms. These
pathogens were E. coli (n = 7), Campylobacter jejuni
(n = 1), Cryptosporidium (n = 2), Giardia (n = 2), and
Norwalk virus (n = 6). More than one other fecal
pathogen was found per specimen in a few cases. The
other 36 individuals with Blastocystis had no other
microorganism identified to account for their
symptoms.
The 36 individuals with fecal specimens positive for
Blastocystis without other pathogens were examined for
symptoms reported during the week prior to or the
week of the specimen collection. Three cases were
associated with 1 day of diarrhea as the only symptom.
An additional 22 cases were associated with diarrhea
plus vomiting, nausea and/or abdominal pain, ranging
from 1 to 5 days duration (mean: 2.1 days). Five cases
were associated with 2–3 days of vomiting, nausea
and/or abdominal pain without diarrhea. An additional
six cases were associated with fever as well as gastrointestinal symptoms (duration: 1–8 days, mean
3.7 days).

Comparison of results from asymptomatic
versus symptomatic individuals with
Blastocystis
When the proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals with fecal specimens positive for Blastocystis were compared, a significant difference was
detected (6.1% and 8.8%, respectively, P = 0.03). However, after adjusting for the co-presence of other fecal
pathogens, this significance was lost and there was no
difference in the proportion of individuals with Blastocystis who were asymptomatic versus symptomatic
(5.8% vs 6.7%, respectively, P = 0.5) (Table 1). In other
words, after consideration of co-pathogens, there was
no significant correlation found between the presence of
symptoms and the presence of Blastocystis in a stool
specimen. After adjusting for age, gender, and presence
of other pathogens, the relative odds of symptoms in
people who had Blastocystis identified compared to
those without Blastocystis was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.49,
P = 0.6). There also was no significant difference in the
proportion of submitted specimens positive for Blastocystis between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (6.0 vs 6.8%, P = 0.5).

Correlation between laboratory
quantification of Blastocystis and symptoms
Of the 63 individuals with baseline specimens positive
for Blastocystis without another identified pathogen, six
(10%) were reported as having abundant parasites, 44
(70%) as few to moderate, 13 (21%) as rare. Of the
36 symptomatic individuals with specimens positive
only for Blastocystis, two (6%) were reported as having
abundant parasites, 28 (78%) as few to moderate, five
as rare (14%), and one case had no quantification. The
proportion of individuals with and without symptoms
who had abundant, few to moderate, or rare parasites
was not different (P = 0.99).

Persistence of Blastocystis

DISCUSSION

Of the 66 individuals with Blastocystis in their stool at
baseline, 20 submitted one or more additional specimens during symptomatic periods of the study. Nine
(45%) of these individuals still had Blastocystis present
in one or more fecal specimens, indicating they had
Blastocystis present during both symptomatic and
asymptomatic periods. In contrast, of 1023 people who
submitted a baseline specimen negative for Blastocystis,
303 submitted a study specimen, 19 of which were positive (6.3%). Thus, those with Blastocystis at baseline
who submitted further specimens during symptomatic
periods of the study were significantly more likely to
have Blastocystis detected on subsequent specimens
than were individuals who were negative for Blastocystis
at baseline (P < 0.001).

In this study, we monitored a cohort of over 2800 people for 15 months. We took fecal specimens from a proportion of these individuals at baseline when all were
free of gastrointestinal symptoms as well as from individuals during symptomatic periods. Overall, after
excluding episodes in which other pathogens were
found, 5.8% of asymptomatic individuals had Blastocystis detected. This compared to detection of Blastocystis
in 6.7% of symptomatic individuals. Thus, the proportions of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals
positive for Blastocystis were not significantly different
(P = 0.5). In addition, the proportion of specimens submitted for analysis that were positive for Blastocystis did
not differ by the symptom status of the participants.
It is interesting that, of individuals with baseline specimens positive for Blastocystis who also submitted a subsequent study specimen, 45% had Blastocystis found in
specimens taken when symptomatic. In contrast, of



No correlation of symptoms and Blastocystis hominis
those with baseline specimens negative for Blastocystis
who submitted study specimens, only 6% of specimens
associated with symptoms were positive for Blastocystis.
This could imply that some individuals have Blastocystis
carriage, and that for these individuals, detection of
Blastocystis is common during both symptomatic and
asymptomatic periods.
Many previous studies examining the potential
pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis have been limited
by a lack of predetermined definition of symptoms and
lack of comprehensive investigations to exclude other
causes of diarrhea. Many have been just case reports or
case series, often in a hospital setting or in the setting of
stools submitted for laboratory examination in symptomatic individuals, which biases results towards finding an association with clinical symptoms. Only a few
studies have examined the prevalence of Blastocystis
among people with gastrointestinal symptoms compared with a control group of asymptomatic individuals,
and the results have been inconsistent.3,11,25–30 In a
recent study of enteropathogens in Swedish adults,
Blastocystis was found twice as commonly in controls as
in patients with diarrhea (9% vs 4%, respectively,
P = 0.005).31 Our study adds further evidence to a lack
of detectable association between Blastocystis and gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompetent hosts.
Several theories have been proposed to explain the
different clinical outcomes of Blastocystis infection.
Some studies have suggested that a higher concentration of parasites is more likely to be associated with
symptoms than a lower number of parasites,11,32,33 but
this was not supported by our findings and has been disputed by others.34–36 A genetic distinction between subgroups leading to variable virulence has also been
proposed to explain the inconsistent pathogenic potential reported,1,37 although again there is disagreement.38,39 Differences in host immune responses and
the presence of immunodeficiency have also been suggested to influence the presence and/or severity of
symptoms.27,40
We found Blastocystis in 6.4% of all specimens, which
is consistent with previous reports.41–43 Reported prevalence rates vary from 1.4 to 18% in developed countries, with much higher rates of 30–50% in developing
countries.44 Blastocystis is transmitted by the fecal-oral
route, and water-borne, food-borne, and person-toperson transmission have also been suggested.8,45,46
Our study has a number of limitations. First, the
group under observation were primarily being studied
to determine whether an association could be found
between drinking water and rates of gastrointestinal
symptoms. Consequently, there were some inclusion
criteria for participation, including a requirement for
participating families to have a minimum of four household members and at least two children aged 1–
15 years, which skewed the age distribution of the study
participants compared to the general population.
Higher prevalence rates of Blastocystis have previously
been reported in adults than children.44 In addition,
occupants needed to own or be in the process of buying
their home, which may mean participants were of a
higher socioeconomic status. Our study was also limited
to individuals without immune suppression or other

1393
chronic illnesses. A history of receiving antimicrobial
treatment could not be elicited. Because of practical
and cost limitations, a convenience sample comprising
only 39% of participants submitted a baseline specimen, and 38% submitted a specimen during symptomatic periods, which limits our study power. In addition,
only one stool specimen was requested during symptomatic episodes.
In conclusion, we report our findings from a cohort of
people monitored during both asymptomatic and symptomatic periods and conclude that there was no correlation between clinical symptoms and the presence or
absence of Blastocystis among this immunocompetent
group of people.
