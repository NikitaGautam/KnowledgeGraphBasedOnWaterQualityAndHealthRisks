Nearshore waters in bays, harbors, and estuaries are
frequently contaminated with human pathogens and fecal
indicatorbacteria.Trackingdownandmitigatingthiscontamination
is complicated by the many point and nonpoint sources of
fecal pollution that can degrade water quality along the shore.
From a survey of the published literature, we propose a
conceptual and mathematical framework, the “beach boundary
layer model”, for understanding and quantifying the relative
impact of beach-side and bay-side sources of fecal pollution
on nearshore water quality. In the model, bacterial concentration
in ankle depth water Cankle [bacteria L-3] depends on the flux
m′′ [bacteria L-2 T-1] of fecal bacteria from beach-side sources
(bather shedding, bird and dog feces, tidal washing of
sediments, decaying vegetation, runoff from small drains, and
shallow groundwater discharge), a cross-shore mass transfer
velocity k [L T-1] that accounts for the physics of nearshore
transport and mixing, and a background concentration
Cbay [bacteria L-3] attributable to bay-side sources of pollution
that impact water quality over large regions (sewage outfalls,
creeks and rivers): Cankle ) m′′/k + Cbay. We demonstrate the
utility of the model for identifying risk factors and pollution
sources likely to impact shoreline water quality, and evaluate
the model’s underlying assumptions using computational
fluid dynamic simulations of flow, turbulence, and mass transport
in a trapezoidal channel.

Introduction
Beaches located inside coastal embayments, or “enclosed
beaches”, are sheltered from the large waves and strong
currents of open coastlines and, for this reason, are popular
destinations for recreational bathers, particularly families
with young children. Unfortunately, these coastal sites also
have among the highest rates of beach closures and health
advisories (1, 2). To our knowledge there are no literature
reviews of the physical and biological processes that control
nearshore water quality at enclosed beaches, despite the
explosion of papers recently published on the topic. This

critical review is intended to fill that gap, and provide a new
conceptual framework (the “beach boundary layer model”)
for predicting the impacts of beach-side and bay-side
pollution on nearshore water quality. For the purposes of
this review, we define “nearshore” as the shallow (ankle to
waist depth) water along the shoreline where water samples
are collected for routine monitoring of recreational beach
water quality. We further divide sources of microbial pollution
into those located in, or inland, of the nearshore (“beachside”) or offshore of the nearshore (“bay-side”). The review
does not encompass predictive regression models of beach
water quality (3), although the findings of regression studies
are discussed to the extent they shed light on relevant physical
and/or biological processes. While the review focuses
primarily on fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)sthe water quality
index used by public health officials to determine if a beach
is safe for swimming and recreationsmany of the results
and conclusions are transferable to the viruses, bacteria, and
protozoa that cause recreational waterborne illness. The
review begins by rationalizing the division of embayments
into nearshore and bay regions, and the division of fecal
inputs into beach-side and bay-side sources. This is followed
by the derivation, testing, and application of the beach
boundary layer model.
Spatiotemporal Scales: Bay versus Nearshore. Whitman
and co-workers (4) argue that water quality impairment of
shoreline waters should be evaluated from the perspective
of a “beachshed”, that includes all nonpoint and point sources
of FIB and pathogens that potentially affect shoreline water
quality, coupled with the biological and physical processes
that amplify or diminish their concentrations. A beachshed
for a FIB impaired coastal embayment is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. We conceptually divide the embayment
into two regions: (1) bay and (2) nearshore. This division is
motivated by at least four considerations. First, most routine
water quality monitoring occurs in waters very close to
shorestypically in ankle to waist depth watersbut water
quality can vary significantly over a few meters in the crossshore direction. For example, Boehm et al. (5) report that
total coliform concentrations in the nearshore waters at
Avalon Beach, Catalina Island, decreased >100 fold from ankle
(∼50 cm) to 10 m depth. Second, most humans recreate very
close to shore, particularly young children who are among
the most vulnerable to recreational waterborne illness
(6-8). Third, some sources of fecal pollution (e.g., point
sources of treated or untreated sewage) affect water quality

of the entire bay, while others (e.g., a small storm drain) have
localized impacts on nearshore water quality. Finally, different physical processes drive water circulation in the bay
and nearshore regions, as described next.
Bay-Wide Circulation. At the bay-scale, water circulation
is driven by tides, density gradients, and winds. Tides
exchange water between the bay and offshore, promote
chaotic mixing, and drive a residual circulation that varies
horizontally, provides nutrients and oxygen, and transports
and dilutes pollutants (9-11). Baroclinic circulation originates
from the within-bay mixing of water parcels with different
densities. When a river discharges to an ocean embayment,
for example, dense ocean water is drawn into the bay, mixes
with the fresh water, and the product is returned to the ocean.
In low mixing environments, the recirculation is vertically
stratified and in high mixing environments the recirculation
is laterally stratified (11). Winds exert a stress on the water
surface that can enhance the exchange of water between the
bay and offshore, generate surface water waves, and drive
within-bay circulation (11).
Nearshore Circulation. Mixing and circulation in the
nearshore region is affected by “down-scaling” of the bayscale processes described above (tides, density gradients,
and winds) (12) and physical processes confined to the
shoreline (13). Breaking waves are an example of the latter.
The cascade of momentum and energy from breaking waves
generates along-shore and cross-shore currents that often
dominate the nearshore transport of contaminants and
sediments, particularly on open (unsheltered) coastlines
(13-16). In sheltered embayments, waves are typically smaller
and human activities can play an important role. For example,
water currents along the City of Seattle waterfront in Elliot
Bay are dominated by boat traffic; in particular, ferries that
continuously apply thrust while docked in the harbor (17).
Boat wakes generate turbulence capable of resuspending
sediments, and presumably particle-associated bacteria, at
the shoreline (18). Indeed, the use of mechanical flow devices
to artificially “enhance” circulation has been marketed as a
way to improve beach water quality, although questions
persist about the efficacy, practicality, and ecological impact
of such an approach (2). Generally speaking, nearshore
pollutant transport in embayments occurs by advection and
turbulent mixing (19, 20).
Sources of Microbial Pollution: Bay-Side versus BeachSide. Sources of microbial pollution in nearshore waters can
be divided into two categories: (1) bay-side sources that
impact water quality over large regions of the bay, and (2)
beach-side sources that have localized and transient impacts.
Because these two source categories operate over different

spatial and temporal scales, from a modeling perspective
their effect on ankle depth water quality can be treated
separately. In particular, we assume that bay-side sources
contribute a background concentration Cbay that varies with
location in the bay (e.g., higher at shoreline sites closer to
a point source discharge of sewage) and varies slowly over
time (e.g., higher during periods of increased point source
loading or reduced tidal mixing). In contrast, beach-side
sources are characterized by a shoreline loading rate m′ (units
of bacteria per time per length of beach) the magnitude of
which varies by beach, and over tidal and longer time scales
at any particular beach. The contribution of beach-side and
bay-side pollution to the concentration Cankle of FIB in ankle
depth water is assumed to be additive, viz:
Cankle ) f(m′) + Cbay

(1)

where f is a functional relationship derived later. In this
section we survey bay-side pollution sources that contribute
to the term Cbay, and beach-side pollution sources that
contribute to the term m′.
Bay-Side Pollution Sources. Bay-side contributions to the
term Cbay include both point- and nonpoint sources of fecal
pollution. Large point sourcesssuch as rivers and partially
treated or untreated sewage effluentscan have bay-wide
impacts on water quality via at least two pathways: (a) direct
discharge to the bay, and/or (b) discharge outside of the bay
(e.g., in the coastal ocean), followed by import into the bay
by tides and currents. In general, the mixing of river or
wastewater effluent into receiving waters occurs in three
stages, namely: (1) near-field mixing which is dominated by
the buoyancy and/or momentum flux of the effluent at the
point of discharge; (2) far-field mixing which is dominated
by ambient turbulence; and (3) midfield mixing which is
transitional between near-field and far-field (21-23). Farfield plume dispersion can be modeled using either Eulerian
formulations (gradient diffusion models) or Lagrangian
formulations (random walk particle tracking techniques) (21).
Examples of both Eulerian and Lagrangian plume tracking
tools are now available online for some regions. One example
is the Great Lakes Forecasting System (24), which includes
a gradient diffusion model for simulating impacts on beach
water quality from the Grand River plume in Lake Michigan
(25). Another is the Lagrangian particle tracking tool maintained by the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing
System that predicts, based on hourly high frequency radar
measurements of surface currents in the coastal Pacific
Ocean, the trajectory of the Tijuana River Estuary plume
near San Diego, California (26). The latter modeling tool was

recently used to determine the relative impact of both river
and wastewater outfall plumes on coastal beach water quality
along the California/Mexico border (27).
Nonpoint sources of bay-side pollution include vessel
waste discharges (28-30) and diffusive, advective, and/or
erosive release of FIB from sediments (31-35). Federal law
in the U.S. prevents the discharge of raw (untreated) sewage
in no discharge zones, including the Great Lakes, all navigable
waters of the U.S., and within 3 miles of the coasts (30).
However, based on random surveys of recreational boaters
it appears that illegal dumping of sewage is commonplace
in some areas of the U.S., due to a paucity of pump-out
facilities, a lack of appreciation of the potential environmental
impacts, and the limited range of many recreational boats
(29). In the U.S., less stringent laws and regulations apply to
the dumping of untreated gray water in coastal areas (e.g.,
from galleys, baths, showers, and dishwaters) and a recent
U.S. EPA assessment of wastes generated from cruise ships
reported average fecal coliform concentrations in untreated
gray water from 3 to 40 × 106 bacteria/100 mL, or “one to
three orders of magnitude greater than typical fecal coliform
concentrations in untreated domestic wastewater” (30). In
practice, estimates of Cbay for a particular beach can be
determined empirically, by measuring pollutant concentration in deeper waters offshore, or predicted by the Lagrangian
or Eulerian plume tracking models described above. At many
enclosed beaches, the background concentration will be a
minor contributor to nearshore water quality, and therefore
Cbay ≈ 0.
Beach-Side Pollution Sources. The contribution of beachside pollution to the term m′ includes bather shedding, bird
or animal feces, beach sediments, decaying marine vegetation
(e.g., associated with wracklines), runoff from small drains,
and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD):
m′ ) m′bather + m′feces + m′seds + m′wrack + m′drains + m′SGD
(2)
Simple expressions for each of these loading rates are
proposed in Table 1; literature sources for key parameter
values are also shown in the table. Present understanding of
beach-side sources is summarized below.
Elmir et al (36) estimate that the average marine bather
sheds 300 000 enterococci bacteria in the first 15 min of
immersion. Less enterococci bacteria are shed with subsequent immersions, and sand attached to the skin of bathers
does not appear to be the source of FIB, consistent with a
previous study that concluded most FIB released by bathers
is associated with fecal matter (37). The deposition of dog
and bird droppings on foreshore sediments is frequently
implicated as a source of FIB in nearshore waters (35,
38-40); however, nearshore FIB concentrations are not
always correlated with bird abundance, even in tidal ponds
specifically managed as bird habitat (41). Beach sands can
harbor FIB (42), genetic markers for human fecal contamination (enterococci bacteria with the human esp gene and
human specific HF183 Bacteroidales) and human pathogens
(Vibrio vulnificus, and Cryptosporidium) (43, 44). Potential
sources of FIB in beach sands include human and animal
feces, runoff, spilled sewage, and/or the growth of environmentally adapted FIB strains (44-48). FIB present in foreshore sediment can transfer into the water column with the
rising tide; that is, the tides “wash” the sand free of bacteria
(42). Shoreline vegetationsincluding the macroalga Cladophora in freshwaters (49, 50) and seaweed in marine waters
(35, 51)sis another potential source of FIB. Indeed, the tidal
washing of FIB-laden foreshore sediments and decaying
seaweed in wracklines may explain why nearshore water
quality at many marine beaches in California is worse during
spring tides when the daily maximum tide range is large
(52).

Dry and wet-weather runoff from small drains contributes
terrestrial flux of FIB and other contaminants to nearshore
waters (53, 54). During dry weather, nonpoint source runoff
originates from activities in the watershed that generate
excess water, such as over irrigation and car washing. In arid



urban settings such as southern California, runoff that does
not evaporate or infiltrate, flows through a network of gutters,
curbs, and underground pipes (collectively referred to as the
storm sewer, see Figure 1) to the beach, where it typically
discharges without treatment through small drains distributed around the perimeter of the bay. Dry and wet weather
runoff from drains is a documented source of FIB and
molecular markers of human fecal pollution at recreational
beaches (53-56), and bather illness rates appear to increase
with proximity to drains discharging dry weather runoff
(57). In general, the volume of runoff flowing out of any single
storm drain during dry weather is small and intermittent.
Nevertheless, dry weather runoff from drains can potentially
affect nearshore water quality because of the high concentration of FIB carried in runoff and the location of drain
outlets close to the waterline where water depths are shallow
and dilution is minimal (15, 58, 59). The recreational water
quality impacts posed by wet and dry weather urban runoff,
and modeling tools available for planning and mitigation,
are reviewed elsewhere (60, 61). The coastal discharge of
shallow groundwater can also contribute to the terrestrial
flux of FIB and other fecal indicators to nearshore waters,
particularly if the shallow groundwater is contaminated with
sewage from poorly functioning onsite disposal treatment
systems or leaking sewage collection infrastructure (62-67).
Deriving the Beach Boundary Layer Model. In this section
we derive the “beach boundary layer model”, which in effect
is an explicit expression for the functional relationship f that
appears in eq 1. Assuming that the bacterial removal follows
first-order kinetics (elaborated further below), the balance
between FIB advection, turbulent mixing, and removal in
any differential element in the water column can be expressed
mathematically as follows (68):

(3)

The variables in eq 3 represent the concentration of FIB in
the water column (C), time (t), spatial coordinates in the
alongshore (x), cross-shore (y), and vertical (z) directions,
current velocities in the alongshore (U), cross-shore (V), and
vertical (W) directions, turbulent diffusion coefficients in the
alongshore (εx), cross-shore (εy), and vertical (εz) directions,
and a first-order removal rate constant (kr).
A number of nonconservative and ecological processes
can affect nearshore FIB concentrations, including (1)
sequestration and differential survival in sediment (69-73)
(2) bacterial mortality by exposure to sunlight (74, 75), reactive
oxygen species (76, 77), and predacious protozoa (78-80),
(3) selection and growth (46, 81-83), and (4) resuscitation/
recovery of injured (viable but nonculturable) cells (84). In
eq 3, all of these nonconservative and ecological processes
are lumped into a single first-order decay term (last term in
the equation)san approach that will be inadequate in many
settings. For example, if FIB mortality is dominated by
protistan grazing, as appears to be the case in both fresh and
marine waters (78-80), then the first-order rate “constant”
kr may depend on the abundance and clearance rates of
dominant predators. A simple first-order decay term is also
inadequate for modeling light-induced bacterial mortality,
which varies diurnally and with depth through the water
column (76, 85), and the turbulent sedimentation and
resuspension of particle-associated FIB (86).
Rather than attempt to address these shortcomings by
significantly increasing the complexity of eq 3 (e.g., see ref
86), here we adopt the opposite tact by setting the loss term
to zero, in effect neglecting all nonconservative and ecological
processes. By focusing exclusively on the transport aspect of
the problem, we can elucidate the role that physical processes

play in regulating nearshore water quality in settings where
ecological and nonconservative processes are less important.
The opposite approachsassuming FIB concentrations are
controlled only by nonconservative and ecological processess
is also interesting, and no doubt real systems exhibit some
mixture of transport and nonconservative/ecological control.
It is also interesting to note that nonconservative and
ecological processes may be less important in situations
where FIB and/or pathogens are monitored using cultureindependent methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR). Measurements of genome copy number by
qPCR may be insensitive to the aggregation state of cells in
a sample, their association with particles, or their distribution
between culturable and nonculturable statessall factors that
can affect measurements of FIB by conventional culturedependent methods (87, 88).
After dropping the bacterial removal term, eq 3 can be
further simplified by invoking a set of transport-related
assumptions that may apply in the nearshore region of coastal
embayments: (1) turbulent diffusion dominates over advection in the cross-shore direction (|VC| , |εy ∂C/∂y|); (2)
advection dominates over turbulent diffusion in the longshore direction (|UC| . |εx ∂C/∂x|); and (3) FIB concentrations
quickly reach quasi-steady-state (∂C/∂t ≈ 0). Assumptions
(1) and (2) imply that nearshore currents follow the shoreline
topography. Assumption (3) implies that nearshore concentrations of FIB quickly achieve quasi-steady-state in
response to changes in pollutant loading and transport rates.
Invoking these assumptions and depth-averaging the remaining terms in eq 3 (where depth-averaged pollutant
j we arrive at a classic “boundary
concentration is denoted C)
layer” balance between alongshore advection and cross-shore
turbulent diffusion, where Z(y) represents the water depth
at cross-shore distance y:

(4)

In formulating eq 4 we allow for the possibility that alongshore
velocity, water depth, and turbulent diffusivity all vary with
cross-shore position y (see schematic at the top of Figure 2).
The emphasis on alongshore advection and cross-shore
diffusion is consistent with detailed FIB budgets carried out
for recreational beaches in both Lake Michigan (68) and
Huntington Beach in southern California (15, 89).
Exact Solution of the Beach Boundary Layer Equation. The
boundary layer equation above is standard in many engineering and scientific textbooks (90). What is unique to this
application is the prismatic geometry of the boundary and
an alongshore velocity and cross-shore eddy diffusivity that
vary with cross-shore position. Despite these complications,
we show in the Supporting Information that eq 4 can be
solved exactly given the following parametrizations for the
cross-shore variation in water depth, along-shore velocity,
and cross-shore turbulent diffusion:

where zo,uo,ε0 represent the water depth, along-shore velocity,

model assumes that turbulent diffusion scales linearly with
water depth, εy ∼ Z1, consistent with Kolmogorov-Prandtl
turbulence closure with water depth as the turbulent length
scale (91). After combining eqs 4 and 5, performing a similarity
transformation, and applying two boundary conditions

Comparison of Exact Solution and Numerical Simulations.
The exact solution derived above was obtained after considerable simplification of eq 3, not only relative to ecological
and nonconservative processes neglected (see discussion
above), but also relative to the limited set of physical processes
assumed to dominate nearshore transport. To determine if
the latter “transport-related” assumptions are realistic, we
compared the exact solution to a computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulation of coupled Reynolds- and depthaveraged (2-dimensional) fluid mass, momentum, turbulence, and pollutant transport equations using a Godunovtype finite volume scheme with k-eps turbulence closure
(92-94). Save the steady-state assumption, the CFD simulations employed none of the assumptions or parametrizations
used to derive the exact solution. Thus, a comparison of
concentration fields predicted from the CFD simulations and
the exact solution should constitute a fair test of the
assumptions employed to derive the latter. The CFD solution
was implemented over a long straight channel (2000 m long
by 100 m wide) with a line source of pollution located along
one bank (m′ ) 100 bacteria m-1 s-1 for x > 0) (Figure 2, left
panel). The upstream and downstream boundary conditions
consisted of a constant inlet flow rate (1 m3 m-1 s-1) and
8808 9 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY / VOL. 44, NO. 23, 2010

constant outlet water depth (6 m at the centerline), respectively, and the channel cross-section was trapezoidal with a
constant side slope (s ) 0.25) out to a depth of 6 m (20 m
from the bank). Details of the CFD simulations, and the
approach used to assign parameter values for the exact
solution’s velocity and eddy diffusivity fields, are presented
in the Supporting Information.
The pollutant concentration field predicted for one CFD
simulation (for a grid dimension of 2 × 1 m ) length by
width) is shown in Figure 2 (lower left panel). The highest
pollutant concentrations are confined to a thin region close
to the shore, consistent with the idea that beach-side pollutant
loading leads to the development of a concentration boundary layer, or “beach boundary layer”. The concentration
boundary layer is characterized by a sharp concentration
front that moves bayward with increasing alongshore distance
x. At the furthest downstream location, x ) 2000 m, the
numerical simulation illustrated in Figure 2 predicts that
pollutant concentrations decrease >100 000 fold over a crossshore distance of <30 m. A very similar concentration field
is predicted by the exact solution (compare left and right
lower panels, Figure 2), suggesting that, despite the transportrelated assumptions invoked in its derivation, the exact
solution (eq 6) is a reasonable representation of pollutant
mixing and transport in the nearshore.
Cross-shore variation in pollutant concentration predicted
by the exact solution and CFD simulations (with three
different choices of grid size) are presented for x ) 1000 m
in Figure 3. Consistent with the discussion above, the CFD
and exact solutions predict a plateau in concentration close
to shore, and a sharp concentration front at water depths
between 0.3 and 5 m. Although not shown in Figure 3, there
is also a concentration singularity at y ) 0, where the pollution
line source discharges to zero water depth. The CFD-pre-

grid sizes shown, all at x ) 1000 m.
dicted plateau concentration increases as the cross-shore
resolution of the numerical grid is refined, from 2 m to 50
cm (Figure 3). This observation highlights a fundamental
challenge associated with numerical predictions of FIB
concentrations in ankle depth water: sharp fronts in pollutant
concentration are subject to numerical diffusion that is grid
resolution dependent (92, 93). The numerical predictions
converge at the outer edge of the concentration front (depths
>4 m), but do not reliably predict the ankle-depth pollutant
concentration, most likely due to numerical diffusion and
the concentration singularity at y ) 0.

Comparing eqs 1 and 8a we conclude that, in our version of
the beach boundary layer model, the functional relationship
in eq 1 is given by f(m′) ) m′/z0k. The cross-shore mass
transfer velocity k [units of L T-1] encapsulates the physics
of nearshore transport and mixing, and is proportional to
the reference eddy diffusivity ε0 and inversely proportional
to yBBL, where the latter is an estimate for the width of the
beach boundary layer. The approximate expression for yBBL
in eq 8c is valid provided that x > 10l. Solving for the flux of
FIB out of ankle depth water, m′′ ) m′/z0, eq 8a can be
rearranged into a form that is mathematically identical to
the film theory expression for interfacial mass transfer (90):
m′′ ) k(Cankle - Cbay)

(9)

These results have significant implications for the influence
of beach-side pollution sources on FIB concentrations in
ankle depth waters, as explored in the next section.

where Ccriterion is a water quality criterion and m′criterion is the
beach-side pollution loading rate above which an exceedence
of the criterion occurs. For the set of parameters values in
Table S1 (Supporting Information), x ) 1000 m, and using
the EPA recommended criterion for enterococci bacteria
(ENT) at marine bathing beaches (104 bacteria per 100 mL),
we obtain the following model parameter values: yBBL ) 0.7 m,
k ) 3 × 10-4 m/s, and m′criterion ) 3 × 105 bacteria m-1 h-1.
Given this criterion loading rate, and the line source
expressions listed in Table 1, plots of eq 10a are presented
for seven different beach-side pollution sources in Figure 4.
While all pollution sources can trigger criterion exceedence
(i.e., Cankle/Ccriterion > 1), some sources are clearly more
problematic than others. Consistent with the findings of
Wright et al. (39), dog feces are a potent contributor of
ENTsas little as 1 g of dog feces deposited at low tide per
meter of beach is sufficient to cause a water quality
exceedence during the following rising tide (red line, Figure
4). By comparison, an average of 30 and 80 g of dry feces are
produced by small and large dogs, respectively, during a single
fecal event (39). For all other sources, the model predicts
that the concentration of ENT in ankle depth water is 10
times greater than the EPA criterion whenever one or more
of the following conditions are met: (1) ENT concentrations

in foreshore sediments exceed 500 bacteria/10 g (green line
in Figure 4); (2) more than 10 bathers wade into the water
per hour per meter of beach (dark blue line); (3) ENT
concentration in shallow groundwater exceeds 2000 bacteria/
100 mL (light blue line); (4) more than 70 g of bird droppings
are washed by the tide per meter of beach (brown line); (5)
more than 500 g of decaying vegetation are washed by the
tide per meter of beach (pink line); and (6) ENT concentration
in runoff exceeds 500 000 bacteria/100 mL in small drains
spaced 10 m apart (black line). It should be noted that the
relatively low impact predicted for drains assumes a flow
rate of 200 L day-1 (see Table 1), which is typical for dry
weather runoff volumes from small (104-105 m2) urban
catchments in Newport Bay in southern California (unpublished data), but will be on the low side for many other beach
settings. At beaches where the average flow rate of runoff
from drains exceeds 200 L day-1, the black line in Figure 4
will shift to the left. Indeed, Dorsey (59) evaluated water
quality improvement projects at 17 beach sites in California,
and found that dry weather diversionssin which dry weather
runoff from storm sewer drains is diverted from the beach
to the sanitary sewer system for treatmentswere the most
likely to improve beach water quality.
The location of curves in Figure 4 depends on the value
chosen for the cross-shore mass transfer velocity. Intriguingly,
the value adopted here (k ) 3 × 10-4 m/s) is within the range
of k values (10-5 to 0.1 m/s) reported for interfacial mass
transfer in turbulent flows (95), potentially linking the
problem of beach water quality to the well-developed
literature on turbulence-driven interfacial flux (95). However,
it is unclear at this stage how environmental factors unique
to beaches (e.g., generation of nearshore turbulence by waves
and currents, the prismatic geometry of the interface, and
bed roughness, to name a few) and to FIB and pathogens
(e.g., their origin within the nearshore wedge, size, diffusivity,
and potential particle association) influence the value of k.
Therefore, the mass transfer velocity value used to generate
the curves in Figure 4 should be viewed as illustrative, and
by no means definitive.
One quirk of our exact solution is the semi-infinite nature
of the line source geometry, which starts at fixed point along
the beach, at x ) 0. A less general result can be obtained by
j
forcing ∂C/∂x
) 0 in eq 4, whereupon the predicted crossshore mass transfer velocity becomes

where εankle is the eddy diffusivity in ankle depth water (located
at cross-shore position yankle) and ybay is the cross-shore
distance over which the beach boundary layer persists.
Unfortunately, this simplification, while eliminating the need
to specify an alongshore distance x, does not allow for the
computation of ybay from known or presumed parameters;
c.f., the expression for yBBL in eq 8c.
Practical Implications and Future Research. The large
impact of beach-side sources on nearshore water quality,
illustrated above, derives from the low dilutions associated
with the prismatic geometry of the water column, together
with the physics of nearshore mixing and transport which
is dominated by along-shore advection (e.g., from tidal flow
in and out of a tidal embayment) and cross-shore turbulent
diffusion (e.g., from waves and currents). These geometrical
and physical transport characteristics result in the development of a concentration boundary layersor “beach boundary
layer”sthat traps pollution in shallow water very close to
shore, where routine water quality monitoring is carried out
and most human recreational contact occurs. As a practical
matter, these observations highlight the importance of
controlling beach-side sources of fecal pollution, particularly
8810 9 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY / VOL. 44, NO. 23, 2010

in cases where fecal-oral pathogens are present (e.g., from
sewer overflow into storm sewer drains).
The very sharp concentration fronts predicted by the
numerical and exact solutions are consistent with the
observation that FIB concentration falls off rapidly with
increasing water depth in sheltered embayments. According
to eq 9, when Cankle > Cbay, beach-side pollution sources are
primarily responsible for FIB impairment in ankle depth
waters, and the net flux of FIB is directed from onshore to
offshore; that is, m′′ > 0. The sign of the cross-shore gradient
reverses (Cankle > Cbay) at beaches impacted by the onshore
transport of bay-side sources, and the net flux of FIB is
directed from offshore to onshore; that is, m′′ < 0. Thus, the
sign of the cross-shore FIB concentration gradient indicates
the relative importance of beach-side and bay-side pollution.
Our results have implications relative to the design of
recreational beach monitoring programs. The CFD and exact
solutions predict a concentration singularity at the waterline,
or “triple-point”, where water, beach, and air all intersect.
Clearly, real beaches will not have infinite concentrations at
the triple-point, but our results suggest that FIB concentrations in “ankle depth” water are likely to be very sensitive to
small variations in how and where water samples are
collected. This observation may help to explain why recreational beach water quality data exhibit extreme (fractallike) variability (96)sa fact that negatively impacts the
reliability of public water quality notification programs (97)
and recreational waterborne illness risk and cost assessments
(98). Shifting the sampling location from ankle to waist depth
should yield a more representative, and stable, estimate of
the “plateau” concentration within the beach boundary layer
(see Figure 3).
To achieve an exact solution to the governing partial
differential equation (eq 3), we neglected all ecological and
nonconservative processes that might affect FIB concentrations in shallow nearshore waters, and made further assumptions regarding the dominant mixing and transport
processes associated with nearshore flows. While these
assumptions allow for an exact solution to the governing
partial differential equation, and a specification of the
function f in eq 1, it remains to be seen under what conditions
they are satisfied in practice. For example, our exact solution
assumes that cross-shore advective exchange is negligible
(compared to other processes), and hence it may be
inapplicable at beaches with rip currents and/or cross-shore
directed anthropogenic currents (e.g., prop wash from boats).
Another concern is the uncertainty associated with shoreline
loading rate and transport parameters, which could be
substantial. One advantage of the exact solution derived here
is that parameter uncertainty can be propagated, for example
through Monte Carlo simulations, to yield uncertainty
estimates for nearshore pollutant concentrationsssomething
that is difficult to accomplish in the context of numerical
simulations of nearshore water quality.
