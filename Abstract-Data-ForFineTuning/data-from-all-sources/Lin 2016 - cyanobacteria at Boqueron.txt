Background: Blooms of marine phytoplankton may adversely affect human health. The potential
public health impact of low-level exposures is not well established, and few prospective cohort
studies of recreational exposures to marine phytoplankton have been conducted.
Objective: We evaluated the association between phytoplankton cell counts and subsequent illness
among recreational beachgoers.
Methods: We recruited beachgoers at Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico, during the summer of 2009.
We conducted interviews at three time points to assess baseline health, water activities, and subsequent illness. Daily water samples were quantitatively assayed for phytoplankton cell count. Logistic
regression models, adjusted for age and sex, were used to assess the association between exposure to
three categories of phytoplankton concentration and subsequent illness.
Results: During 26 study days, 15,726 individuals successfully completed all three interviews.
Daily total phytoplankton cell counts ranged from 346 to 2,012 cells/mL (median, 712 cells/mL).
The category with the highest (≥ 75th percentile) total phytoplankton cell count was associated
with eye irritation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.66], rash
(OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.57), and earache (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.77). In phytoplankton
group-specific analyses, the category with the highest Cyanobacteria counts was associated with
respiratory illness (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.67), rash (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.66), eye
irritation (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.62), and earache (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.93).
Conclusions: We found associations between recreational exposure to marine phytoplankton
and reports of eye irritation, respiratory illness, and rash. We also found that associations varied by
phytoplankton group, with Cyanobacteria having the strongest and most consistent associations.

Introduction
Harmful algal blooms occur when phytoplankton accumulate and negatively affect the
environment and human or animal health.
Harmful blooms are associated with a small
subset of phytoplankton species. Out of
4,000 marine phytoplankton, it is estimated
that some 200 are high biomass producers,
and only ~80 are potential toxin-producers
(Masó and Garcés 2006; Smayda 1997;
Smayda and Reynolds 2003; Zingone and
Enevoldsen 2000). Although naturally occurring in fresh, estuarine, and marine waters,
the growth, toxicity, and geographic distribution of harmful algae have increased in
part because of environmental factors such
as nutrient enrichment and warmer water
temperatures (Dyble et al. 2008; Moore et al.
2008; Paerl et al. 2001; Paerl and Huisman
2008, 2009; Sellner et al. 2003). Most epidemiologic studies of harmful algal blooms,
specifically those generated by cyanobacteria,
have been conducted at freshwater sites. In
the United States, freshwater harmful algal
blooms have been associated with waterborne
disease outbreaks that include dermatologic,

gastrointestinal, respiratory, febrile, ear, and
eye symptoms (Dziuban et al. 2006; Hilborn
et al. 2014; Yoder et al. 2004). The World
Health Organization (WHO) has established
guidelines for cell count categories associated
with the risk of human health effects (Bartram
and Chorus 1999). The lowest guidance level
of 20,000 cyanobacterial cells per milliliter
was derived from an epidemiologic study of
freshwater cyanobacteria exposure (Pilotto
et al. 1997). Currently, there is no federal
regulation of cyanobacteria or cyanotoxin
exposure for recreational waters in the United
States; however, several state and local governments have established guidelines for exposure
based on their own risk assessments or those
of the WHO (Burch 2008).
Adverse human health outcomes have
been associated with marine dinoflagellates,
diatoms, and cyanobacteria (WHO 2003).
For example, harmful algal blooms produced
by Karenia brevis, a marine dinoflagellate,
have been reported to produce brevetoxins
that are associated with gastrointestinal and
respiratory illnesses (Backer et al. 2003, 2005;
Hlavsa et al. 2011; Kirkpatrick et al. 2010).

Lyngbya majuscula, a benthic marine cyanobacterium, is known to produce toxins, such
as debromoaplysiatoxin and lyngbyatoxin,
and to cause acute dermal lesions among
swimmers (Nagai et al. 1996; Osborne et al.
2001, 2007; Osborne and Shaw 2008; WHO
2003). The picoplanktonic Synechococcus, a
cyanobacterium, has been reported to produce
microcystins, a group of potent hepatotoxic
cyanotoxins (Carmichael and Li 2006). A
limited number of epidemiologic studies have
investigated the effects of harmful marine algal
exposures, and most of these have focused
on blooms of K. brevis (Backer et al. 2003;
Kirkpatrick et al. 2010). As a result, thresholds or concentrations of phytoplankton
associated with adverse health effects are not
well-established for marine waters.
Given the association between increasing
ocean temperatures and increased frequency
of harmful algal blooms around the world,
there is a need to understand the impact of
harmful algal blooms on human health as

climate change progresses (Dale et al. 2006;
Gingold et al. 2014; Moore et al. 2008;
Peperzak 2005). The objective of the present
study was to evaluate the association between
phytoplankton cell counts and subsequent
illness among recrea­tional beachgoers at a
tropical marine beach.

Methods
We conducted a prospective study of beachgoers at Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico, in
the summer of 2009. We assessed the relationship between phytoplankton counts and
the development of illness after recreational
exposure. This study was in the context of the
National Epidemiological and Environmental
Assessment of Recreational (NEEAR) Water
Study. A description of the study design,
objectives, and protocols and a report of the
associations between fecal indicator organisms
and swimming-associated illness have been
published (Wade et al. 2010b).
Site description. Boquerón Beach is
located on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico
(Figure 1). It is approximately 1 mile long
and is located on Boquerón Bay, adjacent to
the Caribbean Sea.
Interviews. We offered beachgoers
enrollment in the study at the beach on
summer weekends and holidays for a total
of 26 days. Inclusion criteria consisted of
a) an adult household member > 21 years
of age; b) completion of three interviews
(enrollment, beach exit, follow-up); and
c) no previous participation in the study
within the prior 28 days. An adult answered
questions for all other household members
at the beach. Interviews began at Boquerón
Beach on 16 May 2009 and concluded on
2 August 2009.
Participants gave verbal informed consent

language, English or Spanish, and were interviewed by study personnel proficient in the
language. All study materials were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The enrollment interview collected information about demographics, baseline health,
chronic health conditions, and contact information for follow-up. The exit interview
collected information about water exposure
and other activities in which the participants
engaged while at the beach that day. Water
exposure was ascertained with the following
questions: “Did you immerse your body,
not necessarily your head, in the water
today?” “Did you put your face in the water
or submerge your head in the water today?”
and “Did you swallow the water?” The telephone interview, conducted 10–12 days later,
recorded self-reported illness experienced since
the beach visit. Participants were offered incentives, such as a cooler, a tote bag, or a beachrelated item, to encourage completion of the
exit interview. A US$25 check was provided to
each household after the follow-up telephone
interview was completed.
Health end points. The health end points
were defined a priori and were similar to
those previously studied in relation to recreational water quality and health (Colford
et al. 2007; Prüss 1998; Wade et al. 2010a).
They included incident cases of gastrointestinal (GI) illness, respiratory illness, rash
(independent of sunburn), earache, and eye
irritation occurring during the 10- to 12-day
period between the beach visit and the followup telephone interview. The definitions for
each illness are shown in Table 1. Signs and
symptoms of each health end point were
inquired about separately. For example, the
following was asked for stomachache: “Have
you or anyone else had a stomach­a che or
abdominal cramping since the interview at
Boquerón Beach?” Individual signs/symptoms
of illness included the following: stomachache; diarrhea; nausea; vomiting; urinary tract
infection; fever; headache; sore throat; cough;
cold; runny or stuffy nose; earache, ear infection, or runny ears; watery eyes; eye infection;
infected cut; and rash or itchy skin. For each
question, participants could answer yes or no;

or to say that they did not know.
Water samples. Three fixed transects were
selected at least 60 m apart to encompass
the majority of the beach site. Water at sites
along each transect was repeatedly sampled
for marine phytoplankton counts and toxins;
samples were collected from waist depth at
each location at 1100 hours on each study day
(Figure 1). All samples were refrigerated or
placed on ice within 30 min of collection and
were maintained under refrigeration during
shipment to GreenWater Laboratories/
CyanoLab (Palatka, Florida) for analysis.
Water samples were combined into a daily
composite sample and were quantitatively
assayed for total and group phytoplankton
cell counts (cells per milliliter) by an experienced phycologist who used the counting
method described in Standard Methods for
the Examination of Water and Wastewater
(American Public Health Association 1998).
The limit of detection using 5-mL samples at
100× magnification was 0.2 cells/mL. Water
samples were also analyzed for two cyanobacterial toxins, lyngbyatoxin-a and debromoaplysiatoxin, using high-performance liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLCMS) (Nagai et al. 1996; Osborne et al. 2008).
These toxins were selected a priori based on the
characteristics of the site; the limit of detection
for both toxins was 1.0 ppb. Major phytoplankton groups were identified and included
Cyanobacteria, Dinophyta (dinoflagellates),
Bacillariophyta (diatoms), and miscellaneous
other groups and morphotypes.
Statistical analysis. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to evaluate the association
between exposure to different categories of
phytoplankton cell count and incidence of
reported illness. The outcome was a binary
indicator for each health end point as defined
in Table 1. Each outcome was modeled separately. Each analysis excluded participants
who reported having the outcome of interest
in the 3 days before their beach visit.
Phytoplankton cell count was categorized
as high (≥ 75th percentile), medium (> 25th
to < 75th percentile), and low (≤ 25th percentile). The lowest category served as the referent
in the regression models. Cell counts were

Marine phytoplankton and reported illness

considered in total and by phytoplankton
group (e.g., Bacillariophyta, Cyanobacteria,
Dinophyta). Picocyanophytes, a subgroup
of Cyanobacteria, were examined separately
from the Cyanobacteria group because they
occurred at an order of magnitude higher
than the other groups. To focus on those
with recreational water contact, only participants who reported body immersion were
included in models of the association between
­phytoplankton concentration and illness.
Covariates based on information from
previous studies were considered for inclusion
in the final model. Using frequency tables
and chi-square tests, we identified factors
associated with illness and/or water exposure
to potential phytoplankton. These factors
included age, sex, any other chronic illnesses,
self-reported contact with algae, Enterococcus
count, and digging in sand. After adjusting
for different combinations of covariates, the
association between phytoplankton exposure
and incidence of reported illness varied by
less than 0.1. The final model (adjusting for

age and sex) was based on minimizing the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) in order
to balance model parsimony and fit. In sensitivity analyses, we considered other definitions of water exposure: head immersion and
swallowing water. Duration of time spent in
the water was evaluated as a potential effect
measure modifier in stratified analyses.

Results
Respondent characteristics and demographics. During the 26 study days, we
included 15,726 individuals from 6,611
households. This represented 76% of the
households initially approached and 96%
of those completing the beach interview.
There were slightly more female participants
(55%), and nearly all (> 99%) participants
self-identified as Hispanic. The average age
was 30 years (range: < 1 to 92 years); children
< 12 comprised < 20% of the study population. Approximately one quarter of all
participants reported having a chronic illness:
13% reported having allergies, 11% reported

having asthma, 5% reported having a chronic
GI illness, and 3% reported having a chronic
skin condition. Women reported more
chronic illnesses, specifically chronic GI illness
(6% women; 3% men; χ2 p-value < 0.0001)
and allergies (14% women; 11% men; χ2
p-value = 0.0004). Age categories (0–4 years;
5–11 years; 12–19 years; 20–34 years;
35–64 years; ≥ 65 years) revealed differences
in chronic illness (χ 2 p-value = 0.0002);
chronic GI illness increased with age, reports
of allergies were infrequent among the
youngest participants (0–4 years), and reports
of asthma were most frequent among children
< 12 years of age. Participants were excluded
from analyses if they reported having the
illness being evaluated in the 3 days before
their beach visit. At enrollment, 8% of participants reported having a sore throat, and < 3%
reported vomiting, other GI illness, rash, eye
irritation, or earache in the previous 3 days.
Table 2 summarizes the basic characteristics
for all study participants and for those who
reported body immersion in the water.
Beach visit activities. Upon leaving the
beach, 77% of all participants reported body
immersion in the water, 64% reported head
immersion, and 36% reported getting water in
their mouths. Table 3 summarizes a sample of
activities that participants reported engaging in
at the beach. We analyzed the 12,111 participants (77%) who reported at least immersing
their bodies in the water to improve the
accuracy of exposure classification based on
cell counts. As part of a sensitivity analysis,
more substantial exposures were considered,
including those who reported swallowing water
as a marker of extreme exposure (n = 5,615).
Among participants with body immersion,
the mean duration spent in the water was just
> 2 hr. One quarter of all participants spent
≥ 3 hr in the water, and the maximum time
spent in the water was 8 hr.
Illness after beach visit. During the 10- to
12-day period between the beach visit and
the follow-up telephone interview, respiratory
illness was most commonly reported, with an
overall incidence of 7%. The incidence was

Water quality. During the 26 study
days, the median phytoplankton cell
count was 712 cells/mL per day (range,
346–2,012 cells/mL). Of all groups identified, Bacillariophyta had the highest median
(386 cells/mL per day). Cyanobacteria
(excluding Picocyanophytes) had a median
of 132 cells/mL per day. Picocyanophytes
were only detected on 8 days but achieved
a maximum count of 126,891 cells/mL.
Dinophyta had a low median (37 cells/mL
per day). Samples below the limit of detection (< 0.2 cells/mL) were assigned a value
of 0 for calculating phytoplankton distributions. Table 4 summarizes the phytoplankton
­distribution over the study period.
Other phytoplankton groups were
detected on < 8 study days at very low cell
counts. These groups included Haptophyta
(mean = 8.6 cells/mL), Chrysophyta
(mean = 2.8 cells/mL), Rhodophyta
(mean = 0.7 cells/mL), Euglenophyta
(mean = 0.2 cells/mL), and Chlorophyta
(mean = 0.1 cells/mL). See Appendix 1 for a
list of the genera and morphotypes that were
identified and their distribution according

to phytoplankton group. Concentrations of
lyngbyatoxin-a and debromoaplysiatoxin were
below the limit of detection of 1.0 ppb in
every sample.
Enterococcus colony forming units (CFU)
and phytoplankton counts were not correlated (Spearman’s r = –0.14, p-value = 0.5).
As previously reported by Wade et al.
(2010b), low to moderate levels of fecal
indicator bacteria were detected at Boquerón
Beach, and the geometric means of the daily
samples collected were all below the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
guideline value of 35 CFU per 100 mL (Wade
et al. 2010b). Spearman’s correlations between
total phytoplankton counts and different
environmental factors (e.g., wind speed and
direction, air temperature, water temperature,
turbidity) were all < 0.3 (data not shown).
Phytoplankton count and incident illness.
Among beachgoers who reported body
immersion, the highest category of total
phytoplankton cell count (≥ 75th percentile)
was associated with eye irritation [adjusted
odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.01, 1.66], rash (OR = 1.27;
95% CI: 1.02, 1.57), and earache (OR = 1.25;
95% CI: 0.88, 1.77) (Table 5). Cyanobacteria

cell counts were associated with respiratory
illness, eye irritation, rash, and earache. These
associations, although not all statistically
significant at α = 0.05, strengthened with
increasing Cyanobacteria cell count categories
(Figure 2). In particular, respiratory illness,
rash, and earache all had associations that
increased relatively monotonically with each
Cyanobacteria cell count category. Respiratory
illness had the strongest association with all
Cyanobacteria cell count categories. Table 5
shows the associations between phytoplankton
group cell count and incident illness among
beachgoers who reported body immersion.
Picocyanophytes were not associated
with any subsequent illness among participants who reported body immersion in the
water (Table 5). However, among those who
reported swallowing water (n = 5,615), the
presence of Picocyanophytes was significantly
associated with earache (OR = 1.62; 95% CI:
1.14, 2.30), which was reported by 3.3%
(n = 56) of those exposed and 2.1% (n = 83)
of those unexposed. Similarly, among participants who reported swallowing water, the
highest category of Cyanobacteria cell count
was associated with earache (OR = 1.75;
95% CI: 1.09, 2.82), which was reported by

We report the results of a prospective evaluation of the health effects associated with
recreational water exposure to marine phytoplankton in the absence of a harmful algal
bloom. Given the popularity of visiting
beaches (Leeworthy et al. 2005) and the
apparent increase in harmful algal blooms
around the world (Sellner et al. 2003), we
sought to better understand the effects of
marine phytoplankton on human health. We
found an association between total phytoplankton cell count and incident illness:
specifically, eye irritation and rash. These
outcomes have also been associated with
freshwater blooms (Billings 1981; Pilotto et al.
1997; Rapala et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2008).
Our study design established a temporal
sequence between exposure and outcome. By
having interviews performed at different time
points, participants did not have to wait a
long time to recall their experiences, and their
exposure response could not be influenced by
any subsequent illness. The high participation
rate (> 75%) reduced the possibility of selection bias. After considering a range of potential confounders, we only adjusted for age
(as a continuous variable) and sex in order to
balance model parsimony and fit. Because our
final model produced similar results to those
of the full model (adjusting for age, sex, any
other chronic illnesses, self-reported contact
with algae, Enterococcus count, and digging in
sand), there did not appear to be a major bias
due to confounding (data not shown).
Our study design allowed one adult to
answer questions for all other household
members at the beach. Although there was a
possibility for responder bias or misinformation, there was an average of only 3.2 individuals per household, and other household

also differ after exposure to communities of
Cyanobacteria in fresh and marine waters. The
maximum Cyanobacteria cell count (excluding
Picocyanophytes) was 1460.8 cells/mL. In
epidemiologic studies conducted at freshwater
sites, illnesses were associated with cyanobacterial counts > 5,000 cells/mL (Pilotto et al.
1997) and at counts < 20,000 cells/mL relative
to no water contact (Lévesque et al. 2014).
More work is needed to define Cyanobacteria
concentrations that are safe for human health
in marine waters.
We analyzed Picocyanophytes separately
because of the different orders of magnitude
of the cell counts. Although most of the
cyano­b acteria literature describes marine
picoplankton as nontoxic, there are some
reports of toxic effects caused by homogenized Synechococcus and Synechocystis and their
extracts (Martins et al. 2005, 2007; Walsh
et al. 2008). Microcystins have been shown to
cause adverse health effects (Codd et al. 1999;
Falconer 1999; Giannuzzi et al. 2011), and a
study of Synechococcus strains suggested that
some marine picoplankton may be capable
of synthesizing microcystins (Carmichael
and Li 2006).
We observed an association between
earache and Cyanobacteria among those who
reported swallowing water. This finding is
consistent with the positive but nonsignificant
association we estimated among all those who
immersed themselves in water. In the context
of earache, we hypothesize that the stronger
association, when restricted to those who
swallowed water, may reflect more frequent
head immersion and more intense exposure
overall rather than being a direct consequence
of swallowing water. Earache has been associated with swimming, especially when the
head is immersed (Wade et al. 2013). The

members often assisted with the questionnaire
responses. A limitation of our self-reported
outcome data was a lack of specific details
about some of the illnesses. Therefore, it was
difficult to confirm the etiology of the illness
on the basis of the participant responses
alone. For example, we could not necessarily
distinguish among rashes as being associated
with cnidarians, sea lice, cercariae, salt water
itself, or even something completely unrelated
to the beach visit.
Cyanobacteria concentration was associated with all illnesses except GI illness;
the odds of illness increased with cell count
category. Our findings were consistent with
reports of skin and eye irritations associated
with Lyngbya majuscula blooms (Osborne et al.
2007; Osborne and Shaw 2008). Despite these
similar illnesses, the Lyngbya-associated toxins,
debromoaplysia­toxin and lyngbyatoxin-a, were
below the limit of detection in all samples,
and Lyngbya comprised only 3% of total
planktonic Cyanobacteria among samples
(see Appendix 1). Debromoaplysiatoxin and
lyngbyatoxin-a are photolabile and are unlikely
to persist in the water column (Moikeha et al.
1971). It is possible that people had contact
with toxins or toxic material in the water or
on the ocean floor because we did not sample
the seabed or measure other cyanotoxins
­potentially associated with Cyanobacteria.
Unlike previous epidemiologic studies of
freshwater cyanobacterial blooms (Lévesque
et al. 2014; Pilotto et al. 1997), GI illness
was the only illness that did not appear to be
associated with marine Cyanobacteria in the
absence of blooms, even when we restricted
the analysis to participants who reported swallowing water. Although the lack of association
with GI illness may have been because of low
Cyanobacteria cell counts, health effects may

category and 1.8% (n = 29) of those exposed
to the lowest category.
As shown in Table 5, the medium
category of Bacillariophyta was associated
with respiratory illness (OR = 1.28; 95% CI
1.07, 1.54); however, the odds ratio did not
increase for the highest category (OR = 1.10;
95% CI: 0.89, 1.35). Exposure to Dinophyta
was not associated with any illness.
To assess potential effect measure modification by the length of time spent in water,
we conducted analyses stratified by number of
hours spent in the water (< 1 hr, 1 to < 2 hr,
2 to < 3 hr, ≥ 3 hr). We also restricted our
analysis to other categories of water exposure
(head immersion, swallowing water). The
results were similar in the stratified analyses,
with the exception of a stronger earache association with Cyanobacteria and Picocyanophytes
after restricting to participants who reported
swallowing water (data not shown).

presence of any Picocyanophytes (vs. none
detected) was associated with earache among
participants who reported swallowing water.
To our knowledge, this association has not
been previously reported.
Associations with specific outcomes
varied among other phytoplankton groups.
Bacillariophyta cell counts in the 25th to
75th percentile range, but not counts above
the 75th percentile, were significantly associated with respiratory illness when compared
with counts below the 25th percentile. To
our knowledge, Bacillariophyta have not been
associated with respiratory illness in previous
studies. Previous studies of marine diatoms,
such as those of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia
that produce domoic acid, have focused on
adverse outcomes occurring after ingestion of
contaminated shellfish rather than on recreational water exposure (Van Dolah 2000).
Because phytoplankton cell counts were
low, we cannot be confident that associations

with health outcomes were a result of phytoplankton exposure alone, or if phytoplankton
were markers for other unmeasured causative factors, such as potentially pathogenic
microbes or physical-chemical conditions
associated with marine phytoplankton. In
addition, we are unable to rule out noncausal
mechanisms related to chance or bias (e.g.,
uncontrolled confounding, selection bias,
information bias). Although phytoplankton
may provide nutrients and substrates for the
survival of microbial communities, there
is limited knowledge on the occurrence of
phytoplankton-associated pathogens (Brettar
et al. 2007; Maugeri et al. 2004).
We categorized cell count a priori as
high (≥ 75th percentile), medium (> 25th to
< 75th percentile), and low (≤ 25th percentile) because health guidelines for concentrations of marine phytoplankton have yet to
be established. As a result, it is possible that
the highest cell count category was actually

Conclusions
We found associations between recreational
exposure to marine phytoplankton and subsequent reports of eye irritation, respiratory
illness, earache, and rash at a tropical beach
in the absence of an algal bloom. In addition,
we found that associations varied by phytoplankton group, with Cyanobacteria having
the strongest associations with most of the
outcomes assessed.

below any level that could cause potential
adverse health effects. For example, although
we did not find an association of illness
with Dinophyta, maximum cell counts for
Dinophyta were only 105.9 cells/mL. In
contrast, epidemiologic studies of the marine
dinoflagellate, K. brevis, and associated
respiratory illness measured maximum cell
counts ranging from 8,120 cells/mL (Backer
et al. 2003) to 121,000 cells/mL (Backer
et al. 2005).
We reported cell counts per milliliter of
water so that our findings could be compared
with those of previous studies and the WHO
guidelines for freshwater exposures (Bartram
and Chorus 1999). A limitation of our phytoplankton assessment was that we had no
information on cell size to calculate biomass
concentrations. Cell size can influence total
phytoplankton exposure. For example, a few
large cells of one species may contribute more
to the overall biomass than many small cells
of a different species (Hillebrand et al. 1999).
Finally, our study participants spent a
large amount of time in the water; half of
them spent ≥ 2 hr in the water. It is possible
that we observed associations between health
outcomes and low phytoplankton counts, in
the absence of active phytoplankton blooms,
because the participants spent so much time
in the water. However, the associations did
not vary significantly when stratified by total
time in the water (data not shown).
Our results offer insight into the potential
health effects of marine phytoplankton in the
absence of a harmful algal bloom. Although
some associations could be due to chance or
bias, most seem plausible based on the existing
literature. The evaluation of health effects associated with recreational exposure to marine
phytoplankton at sub-bloom concentrations
warrants further investigation.
