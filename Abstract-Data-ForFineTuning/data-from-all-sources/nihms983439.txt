Abstract
EPA Author Manuscript

Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative to fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), particularly as
surrogates of enteric virus fate and transport, due to their closer morphological and biological
properties. Based on a review of published data, we summarize densities of coliphages (F+ and
somatic), Bacteroides spp. and enterococci bacteriophages (phages) in individual human waste,
raw wastewater, ambient fresh and marine waters and removal through wastewater treatment
processes utilizing traditional treatments. We also provide comparisons with FIB and enteric
viruses whenever possible. Lastly, we examine fate and transport characteristics in the aquatic
environment and provide an overview of the environmental factors affecting their survival. In
summary, concentrations of bacteriophages in various sources were consistently lower than FIB,
but more reflective of infectious enteric virus levels. Overall, our investigation indicates that
bacteriophages may be adequate viral surrogates, especially in built systems, such as wastewater
treatment plants.

Introduction
Due to intrinsic economic, aesthetic and recreational benefits, an estimated 39% of the
United States population, and over 50% of the global population lives in close proximity to
rivers, lakes or oceans (Kummu et al. 2011; National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration 2013). Enteric pathogens can enter aquatic environments through wastewater

treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents, industrial waste, concentrated animal feeding
operations or by more imperceptible means such as undocumented septic system failures,
leaking sewers, as well as from agricultural and wild animals. Human excreta, however, are
the primary source of infectious enteric viruses of potential concern to recreators, due to
high shedding rates of infected individuals (Osborne et al. 2015; Taniuchi et al. 2015; Sabria
et al. 2016) and low dose required for illness (Atmar et al. 2014; Messner et al. 2014). Since
enteric viruses are the leading etiologic agents of waterborne disease outbreaks in
recreational water settings (Sinclair et al. 2009), exposure to human waste (e.g. untreated
sewage, secondary disinfected wastewater effluent, primary wastewater effluent) represents
the highest manageable pathogen risk to public health (Soller et al. 2010a; Soller et al.
2010b). While the health risk resulting from exposure to cattle manure may not be
substantially different due to the presence of zoonotic pathogens, most other animal sources
tend to be of lesser concern (Soller et al. 2010b; Soller et al. 2014).

Due to the difficulties associated with direct detection of pathogens in water, the potential
presence of fecal pollution is typically assessed by using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) which
include, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (Ashbolt 2001). The utility of
culture-based assessments of FIB for use in protecting public health, however, has
limitations. Since FIB reside in the gastrointestinal tract of many different animals, they
cannot be used to distinguish between fecal contamination sources. FIB also display
different fate and transport characteristics within waste treatment infrastructure and natural
aquatic environments when compared to that of viral and protozoan pathogens (Ashbolt
2001; Boehm et al. 2009a). Bacteriophages are viruses that are dependent on a bacterial host
for replication, and those infecting FIB or other commensal intestinal species (e.g.
Bacteroides) are subsequently shed by hosts and follow similar routes of diffusion into the
environment to that of enteric viral pathogens. Furthermore, bacteriophages have similar
morphological characteristics to those of many enteric pathogenic viruses suggesting that
they can better mimic their survival (Payment et al. 2001; Payment and Locas 2011).
Therefore, bacteriophage have been considered potentially attractive surrogates of viral
pathogens because of their similarity in persistence in both built environments (e.g.
WWTPs) as well as recreational waters. In this review, we focus on E. coli, Bacteroides spp.,
and enterococci bacteriophages to explore their potential as fecal indicators.

Bacteriophages infecting E. coli, Bacteroides spp. and enterococci
Coliphages
Coliphages are viruses that have the ability to infect E. coli, and are split into two categories
based on the route of bacterial host infection. Somatic coliphages attach through specific
protein receptors found on the outer host cell membrane (Kott 1974), while male specific (F
+) coliphages (F-RNA & F-DNA) infect via the host’s sex (F) pili (Davis 1961). They are
the most extensively studied phages for considerations as possible indicators of fecal
pollution and surrogates for viral fate and transport (Skraber et al. 2002; Cole et al. 2003;
Duran et al. 2003; Skraber et al. 2004a) and are a part of multiple regulatory frameworks
involving monitoring of groundwater (United States Environmental Protection Agency
2006), biosolids (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012), water recycling

(Queensland Government Environmental Protection Agency 2005; North Carolina
Environmental Quality 2011) and aquaculture practices (Food and Drug Administration and
Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission 2015). In addition, coliphages are now being
considered for monitoring of recreational waters (United States Environmental Protection
Agency 2015; 2016). Please see recent reviews regarding coliphages as model organisms
(Jofre et al. 2016) and possible indicators of fecal contamination (United States
Environmental Protection Agency 2015).

EPA Author Manuscript

Somatic coliphages are classified into four major taxonomic groups, Myoviridae (linear
double-stranded DNA), Siphoviridae (linear double-stranded DNA), Podoviridae (linear
double- stranded DNA), Microviridae (circular double-stranded DNA); with the F+ divided
into Leviviridae (single-stranded RNA), Inoviridae (single-stranded DNA) and Tectiviridae
(double-stranded DNA) (Lute et al. 2004; Mesquita et al. 2010). While somatic coliphages
are typically detected using E. coli, they have also been known to also infect Klebsiella and
Shigella spp. (Leclerc et al. 2000; Muniesa et al. 2003). Among the F+ coliphage families,
F-DNA coliphages belonging to Inoviridae have received less attention as water quality
indicators since they are not as abundant as F-RNA coliphages (Leviviridae), and
morphologically are less similar to enteric viruses (Furuse 1987; Leclerc et al. 2000). Based
on the nucleotide sequence similarities, F-RNA coliphages belonging to the family
Leviviridae, are subdivided into two genera Levivirus and Allolevivirus (King et al. 2011).
Considering serological properties, and physiochemical measurements, Levivirus is further
subdivided into genogroups I and II, and Allolevivirus into III and IV (Vinje et al. 2004;
Friedman et al. 2009). Further studies positively link certain genogroups to a specific source
of fecal contamination; human excreta largely contain higher proportions of genogroups II
and III, while non-human sources (bovine, swine and avian) predominantly, but not
exclusively harbor genogroups I and IV (Griffin et al. 2000; Cole et al. 2003; Noble et al.
2003). However, association of F+ genotypes and fecal sources is imperfect as crossreactivity has been recorded (Hsu et al. 1995; Stewart-Pullaro et al. 2006; Stewart et al.
2006; Wolf et al. 2010; Hartard et al. 2015).
Bacteroides spp. phages

EPA Author Manuscript

Bacteroides are Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic, pleomorphic rod-shaped bacteria that are
commonly found in high concentrations in both human and other animal feces (Harwood et
al. 2014). Bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides have been extensively studied to investigate
their potential for microbial source tracking (MST) (Gomez-Donate et al. 2011; Nnane et al.
2011; Harwood et al. 2013; Jofre et al. 2014; Diston et al. 2015; Venegas et al. 2015). Some
Bacteroides spp. host strains (HSP40, RYC2056 and RYC4023) are useful in discriminating
phages from different animal fecal sources (Gomez-Donate et al. 2011), however
geographical limitations (Cornax et al. 1990; Grabow et al. 1995; Araujo et al. 1997), crossreactivity with domestic animal fecal samples (Gomez-Donate et al. 2011), or otherwise low
and highly variable detection rates (Tartera and Jofre 1987; Tartera et al. 1989) have
prompted research into other more applicable Bacteroides spp. strains. B. thetaiotaomicron
(GA17) and B. fragilis (GB124) have been identified as closely associated with human fecal
pollution sources for MST purposes (Payan et al. 2005; Ebdon et al. 2012). Distribution of
GA17 bacteriophages seems to be largely limited to Europe, although detectable levels have

also been reported in Tunisia and Columbia (Blanch et al. 2006; Sirikanchana et al. 2014;
Venegas et al. 2015; Yahya et al. 2015), while B. fragilis (GB124) seems to be somewhat
more widespread, but suffers from lower concentrations in sewage and environmental waters
(Ebdon et al. 2007; Nnane et al. 2011; Ebdon et al. 2012; Harwood et al. 2013; McMinn et
al. 2014; Diston and Wicki 2015). Efforts in identifying new Bacteroides spp. bacteriophage
hosts continue with the identification of strains that can potentially differentiate between
human feces (ARABA 84, CA8) versus animal wastes (RBA 63 and KBA 60) (Wicki et al.
2011; Diston and Wicki 2015; Venegas et al. 2015).
Enterococci phages

EPA Author Manuscript

Intestinal Enterococcus spp. are facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive cocci that are
abundant in both human and animal feces. Some species (e.g. E. faecalis and E. faecium)
have been identified as being frequently found in human intestines, while members of other
species (E. casseliflavus, E. mundtii and E. gallinarum) typically reside in non-human hosts
(recently reviewed in (Byappanahalli et al. 2012)). This bacterial host strain association
suggests that the resulting enterophages could be used for MST purposes (Bonilla et al.
2010; Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2010; Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2013). Studies have
reported detection of E. faecalis phages in human feces, while absent from non-human
sources, so understandably the majority of enterophage MST research has utilized this
bacterial species (Bonilla et al. 2010; Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2010; Purnell et al. 2011;
Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2013). Enterophages have been shown to have survival times
similar to human enteric viruses in both fresh and marine waters, however, the majority of
this research has been restricted to tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Bonilla et
al. 2010; Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2012; Santiago-Rodriguez et al. 2013). To determine the
utility of enterophages as indicators of fecal pollution and enteric virus surrogates, future
studies are needed outside this limited geographical area.

Indigenous bacteriophages in wastewater and environmental waters

EPA Author Manuscript

Our literature search primarily focused on manuscripts (a minimum of two) that reported
quantifiable bacteriophage densities rather than presence/absence or percentage data. If
available, we also included bacterial indicator (FIB) and viral pathogen measurements
(infectious enteric viruses, molecular signal for Adenoviruses and Noroviruses) when
reported from the same samples used to generate bacteriophage data. Infectious enteric
viruses in this context refers to those organisms that can be grown in continuous mammalian
cell lines. The studies included here that reported on the infectious viruses predominantly
relied on Buffalo Green Monkey (BGM) kidney cell line, although some also used
rhabdo(myo)sarcoma, Human Caucasian Colon Adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) or African Green
Monkey kidney (MA-104) lines. Data was collected from text, tables, supplemental
materials or estimated from figures when not available otherwise. We collected the mean of
each data set from which an overall mean was calculated per organism and/or matrix. In
instances where there was no detectable data reported, we substituted it with a zero.
Concentrations of all microorganisms were log10 transformed and normalized to 100 mL,
irrespective of how the data was originally reported. When necessary log10 reduction values
were determined using the following formula: log10 reduction = log10T0−log10TN where T0

is the concentration at the beginning of the wastewater treatment process and TN is the
concentration at the end of the treatment stage or the entire treatment train. Lastly, it is
important to highlight various assumptions we employed when collecting the data. We
assumed that all methods regardless of the protocol used or the intended microbial target
perform equally well while also assuming that matrix (human and animal waste, wastewater,
freshwater and marine water), geographic location and seasonality did not affect method
performance. Because of these limitations we are unable to define any conclusive
relationships in the gathered data, but focus instead on describing general trends we
observed.

EPA Author Manuscript

Our review included data from a total of 89 published manuscripts from five continents and
25 countries including Argentina, Austria, Canada, China, Columbia, Cyprus, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Singapore,
South African Republic, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunis, United Kingdom
and United States. Occurrence data included values from human and non-human excreta,
environmental waters as well as WWTP inactivation studies of FIB, coliphages (somatic and
F+), B. fragilis bacteriophages (RYC2056, GB124, HSP40), B. thetaiotamicron
bacteriophages (GA17), enterophages infecting E. faecalis and viral pathogens (infectious
enteric viruses as well as Noroviruses and Adenoviruses quantified via qPCR).
Occurrence in feces and wastewaters
Human fecal sources—The focus of this section is to primarily review the
concentrations of indigenous viral indicators, while including bacterial indicators as well as
human viral pathogens measured in untreated wastewater. Our emphasis on untreated
wastewater rather than human fecal matter and other on-site collection/disposal systems (e.g.
septic tanks) was governed by the preponderance of wastewater data in the published
literature. When available, studies indicate that concentrations of bacteriophage were
typically lower in feces of individual humans and from on-site systems when compared to
centralized infrastructure (such as WWTPs) (Calci et al. 1998; Lucena et al. 2003; Harwood
et al. 2013; Diston and Wicki 2015). While standard methods are generally used for fecal
indicator enumeration, typically little to no data was reported for recoveries from the
matrices studied, hence adding uncertainties to reported concentrations.

EPA Author Manuscript

Overall, concentrations of FIB were routinely higher compared to those of bacteriophages,
while human viral pathogen levels tended to be the lowest (Figure 1). Of the FIB, mean fecal
coliform concentrations (log10 6.84 ± 0.77 CFU/100 mL) were the highest and ranged from
log10 4.74 −8.87 per 100 mL, followed by E. coli which ranged from log10 6.34−7.00 per
100 mL (mean log10 6.42 ± 0.63). Mean enterococci concentrations were the lowest of the
three (log10 5.88 ± 0.55) and ranged from log10 4.4−6.91 per 100 mL (Figure 1).
When bacteriophage concentrations were examined, both coliphage types (somatic and F+)
were generally higher than any Bacteroides spp. or enterococci phages (Figure 1). The
observed mean concentrations for somatic and F+ were log10 5.26 ± 0.96 (range: log10 1.25–
8.00) and log10 5.24 ±0.92 (range: none-detected −log10 8.00) PFU per 100 mL, respectively
(Figure 1); levels similar to those reported recently in a comprehensive systematic literature
review (Eftim 2016). Of the Bacteroides spp. bacteriophages, RYC2056 type was the most

numerous and it ranged from none- detected to log10 4.92 with an average of log10 4.05
± 1.40 PFU per 100 mL. Levels of B. fragilis HSP40 bacteriophage followed with an
average of log10 3.10 ± 1.49 (ranging from log10 1.60–4.65) PFU per 100 mL (Figure 1).
The average of two remaining Bacteroides spp. phages were lower (log10 2.62 ± 2.25 and
log10 2.61 ± 1.38) and ranged from no detection for both groups to log10 5.04 and log10 4.36
PFU per 100 mL for GA17 and GB124, respectively (Figure 1). It should be noted that
GA17 and GB124 averages are likely to be affected by an uneven geographic distribution,
most notably in the areas where they are not endemic. Bacteriophages infecting E. faecalis
exhibited the lowest average concentration (log10 2.19 ± 0.52), ranging from log10 1.15
−2.89 PFU per 100 mL.

EPA Author Manuscript

Levels of infectious human enteric viruses were clearly the lowest of all microorganisms
examined and averaged log10 0.52 ± 0.82, with a range of log10 0.64–2.41 MPN per 100 mL
of wastewater (Figure 1). Noting again, that recovery data was generally not provided, yet is
known to be highly variable (Petterson et al. 2015). Human viral gene targets measured by
qPCR methods were considerably higher compared to culturable infectious virus
concentrations, averaging log10 3.84 ± 1.33 for Norovirus (combined average of genogroups
I and II) and log10 2.54 ± 2.27 for Adenovirus (Figure 1). Norovirus levels are comparable
to those recently reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis detailing Norovirus
occurrence in raw sewage (Eftim et al. 2017).
Non-human fecal sources—This section focuses on bacteriophage data measured in
animal solid waste as well as animal wastewater and/or fecal slurries. Animal solid waste
included samples collected from 21 species belonging to ruminants (cattle, elk, sheep, deer,
goat), non-ruminant herbivores (donkey, horse, rabbit), omnivores (baboons, gorillas,
orangutans, pigs, vervet monkeys), carnivores (cat, dog) and birds (chicken, duck, goose,
pigeon, seagull, turkey). Animal fecal slurries and wastewater represented a mixture of
individual samples, in many instances from multiple animal species.

EPA Author Manuscript

Similar to untreated municipal wastewater, somatic and F+ coliphages were present in the
highest concentrations, along with B. fragilis RYC2056 phage. In animal fecal slurries and
wastewater, average concentrations were log10 4.67 ± 0.96, 4.39 ± 0.28 and log10 3.61 ±1.89
per 100 mL for F+, RYC2056 and somatic coliphages, respectively (Hill and Sobsey 1998;
Puig et al. 1999; Hill and Sobsey 2001; Hill et al. 2002; Payan et al. 2005; Blanch et al.
2006; Ebdon et al. 2007; Muniesa et al. 2012a; Harwood et al. 2013; McMinn et al. 2014).
In animal solid waste, somatic coliphages were higher (log10 2.55 ±2.05 per gram)
compared to F+ (log10 1.29 ±1.32 per gram), but there was not enough data to compare for
RYC2056 (Grabow et al. 1995; Calci et al. 1998; Miller et al. 1998; Muniesa et al. 1999;
Yee et al. 2006; McMinn et al. 2014; Diston and Wicki 2015). The other Bacteroides spp.
phages were mainly measured in slurry and wastewater and their concentrations ranged from
log10 1.52 ± 1.95, log10 0.69 ± 0.80 and log10 0.23 ± 0.63 per 100 mL for GA17, GB124
and HSP40, respectively (Payan et al. 2005; Ebdon et al. 2007; Muniesa et al. 2012b;
Harwood et al. 2013; McMinn et al. 2014; Diston and Wicki 2015). In addition, GB124
phage was not detected in any solids examined (McMinn et al. 2014; Diston and Wicki
2015). Enterophage was also not detected in any animal solid samples, but there was

Removal through conventional municipal wastewater treatment processes

EPA Author Manuscript
EPA Author Manuscript

In this subsection, our interest was to describe microbial removal at full-scale wastewater
treatment, and therefore we excluded all laboratory and bench scale studies. Due to paucity
of the available data we pooled together all Bacteroides spp. phages into one group. Since
there was not enough data to describe removals through individual stage(s) of the wastewater
treatment train we pooled data and present it as log10 reduction irrespective of any particular
unit of operation (e.g. primary treatment, secondary treatment, disinfection). Even though
there was uneven number of studies per organism, the distribution of papers describing
removal through a particular unit of operation for each microorganism was relatively
consistent. When grouped by the absence or presence of disinfection, the percentage of
manuscripts belonging to each category was 54/47% (fecal coliforms), 63/37% (E. coli),
57/43% (enterococci), 74/26% (somatic coliphages), 71/29% (F+ coliphages), 68/32%
(Bacteroides spp. bacteriophages), 50/50% (Adenoviruses), 44/56% (Nororvirus) and
81/29% (infectious enteric viruses). The pooled data was subjected to Kruskal-Wallis
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunn’s post-hoc test performed using Sigma Plot
version 13.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) to determine whether statistically significant
difference (P > 0.05) exists in log10 reductions among different organisms (Table 1).
Overall, the greatest removal was achieved for culturable FIB, followed by molecular signal
for pathogenic viruses, bacteriophages and finally infectious human enteric viruses (Figure
2). Specifically, reported and/or calculated log10 reductions (± standard deviation) for FIB
were as follows: 2.96 ± 2.07, 2.38± 1.26 and 2.22 ± 1.61 for fecal coliforms, E. coli and
enterococci, respectively (Figure 2). The average removal of q(RT)-PCR signal of
Adenoviruses and Noroviruses was approximately one log10 lower compared to culturebased FIB and measured 1.62 ± 0.93 and 1.60 ± 0.85, respectively (Figure 2). Bacteriophage
removal was similar to that for human viruses and averaged 1.46 ±1.24, 1.46 ± 1.18 and 1.29
± 1.33 for somatic and F+ coliphages and Bacteroides spp. phages, respectively (Figure 2).
Infectious human enteric virus removal was the lowest, averaging 0.90 ± 1.01 log10
reduction (Figure 2).

EPA Author Manuscript

Comparison of compiled data (Table 1) indicated that fecal coliform and E. coli log10
reductions were significantly higher compared to those of bacteriophages and infectious
enteric viruses (P value range 0.019–<0.001), but there was no significant difference when
compared to human viral gene targets (i.e. Adenoviruses and Noroviruses) (P>0.05).
Enterococci removal was significantly greater compared to infectious enteric viruses
(P=0.006), but there were no other statistically significant differences (P>0.05).
Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences when comparing removals of
bacteriophages to those of infectious human enteric viruses, including Adenoviruses and
Noroviruses (P>0.05). This finding suggests that bacteriophages may be better suited to act
as surrogates for human viral pathogen removal through wastewater treatment processes
compared to culturable FIB measurements.

Freshwater—In general, freshwater concentrations of FIB were observed at higher levels
than both bacteriophages and human enteric viruses. Results from a literature analysis
showed mean concentrations of fecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci atlog10 3.46 ± 1.41,
log10 3.59 ±1.70 and log10 3.00 ± 1.47 CFU/100 mL, respectively (Figure 3). Among
bacteriophages, somatic coliphages were detected at the highest concentrations ranging from
0.95 log10 PFU/100 mL to upwards of 5.00 log10 PFU/100 mL in more heavily impacted
freshwaters with mean levels of log10 3.18 ±1.35PFU/100 mL typically observed (Figure 3).
F+ coliphage levels in surface freshwaters averaged log10 2.00 ±1.29 PFU/100 mL mean
levels, approximately log10 1–1.5 lower than somatic coliphages (Figure 3). While
detectable levels of Bacteroides phage are found in environmental waters, they were less
prevalent than somatic coliphages. In freshwaters, levels of Bacteroides phages (all types
combined) were detected at mean concentrations of log10 2.00±1.12 PFU/100 mL, levels
similar to that of F+ coliphages, but an order of magnitude lower than mean levels of
somatic coliphages (Figure 3). Of the three Bacteroides phages, GB124 and HSP40 were
detected at higher mean levels (log10 2.31±1.26 and log10 2.29±1.14 log10 PFU/100 mL,
respectively) compared to RYC2056 (log10 0.9±0.7 mean PFU/100 mL). Phages infecting E.
faecalis were detected at the lowest levels, averaging log10 1.63±1.02PFU/100 mL,
approximately log10 .5 PFU/100 mL lower than Bacteroides phages and F+ coliphages, and
~log10 1.5 PFU/100 mL lower than that of somatic coliphages. Infectious enteric viruses
were detected at lower concentrations than both FIB and bacteriophage, with mean levels of
log10 −1.27 ± 0.95 PFU/100 mL reported (Figure 3). Levels of Adenovirus (log10 1.67
± 2.11 genomic copies/100 mL), Norovirus GI and GII (log10 0.63 ± 0.92 genomic
copies/100 mL) and Rotavirus (log10 0.57 ±1.30 genomic copies/100 mL) determined by
q(RT)-PCR in freshwater were higher than infectious enteric virus concentrations (Figure 3).

EPA Author Manuscript

Marine Water—In marine waters, mean concentrations of fecal coliforms, E. coli and
enterococci were measured at log10 2.88 ± 2.95, log10 1.87 ± 0.58and log10 2.03 ± 1.33
CFU/100 mL, respectively (Figure 3). Overall, FIB concentrations were one to two orders of
magnitude lower compared to freshwaters samples with the largest difference observed for
E. coli (Figure 3). Mean somatic coliphages in marine waters (log10 1.66 ± 1.73) were up to
log10 1.5 PFU/100 mL lower than the levels in freshwater, and ranged from no detection to
log10 6.28 PFU/100 mL (Figure 3). Recorded concentrations of F+ coliphages in marine
waters were lower than those of somatic, averaging log10 0.89±2.23 PFU/100 mL (Figure 3),
an order of magnitude below levels observed in the freshwater. Bacteroides spp. phage (all
types combined) concentrations in marine waters ranged from no detection to log10 4.26

Factors influencing fate and transport of bacteriophages
Through various mechanisms such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs), WWTP
discharges, failing septic systems, or fecal deposits, bacteriophages can enter environmental

waters where they are subject to various selective pressures and environmental insults that
govern their fate and transport. Here we briefly examine some biotic and abiotic factors
influencing survival of bacteriophages in the environment and provide a comparison with
FIB and human enteric viruses when possible. Scarcity of the available data necessitated
pooling the information together irrespective of the study design (e.g. laboratory, bench scale
or field study) or the coliphage origin (e.g. prototypes such as MS2 and ΦX174 as opposed
to indigenous organisms).

Depending on factors such as viral surface charge, pH of the water and levels of suspended
solids in water column, bacteriophages and enteric viruses are often attached to particulate
matter in aquatic environments. However, the processes of viral dispersion, transport and
subsequent attenuation are poorly defined (Ferguson 2003). Attachment to particles is
particularly important when considering the movement since it can partition the organisms
and therefore prevent them from reaching the surface or ground waters. Attachment of
coliphages to particles can be highly variable (ranging from 20% to 60%) and is influenced
by environmental factors, as well as heterogeneity of different bacteriophage groups
(Characklis et al. 2005). This partitioning behavior seems to be somewhat similar to that of
infectious enteric viruses whereby 72 to 78% of samples containing infectious virions are
associated with particles as opposed to 14 to 50% found in the overlaying water column
(Rao et al. 1984). Studies of coliphage transport indicate that the attachment to particles is
the most important process in phage removal, while detachment rates are typically 100 to
1000 times lower (Hijnen et al. 2005), although this process can be considerably influenced
by the oxygen content with greater adsorption observed in more oxic environments
(Frohnert et al. 2014). By comparison, FIB attachment to particles has been reported to be
somewhat more constant (20–55%) (Characklis et al. 2005), a finding that could be
attributed to a more uniform isoelectric point of bacteria (Harden and Harris 1953; Jewett et
al. 1995; Stevik et al. 1999).

Bacteriophage transport is also dependent on the type of soil/sediment as well as velocity of
the surrounding water (Cho et al. 2016). For example, coarse-grained, heterogeneous, gravel
aquifers with high velocities have low filtration capacity and to achieve estimated 7 log10
removal of MS2 bacteriophage it would require a setback distance of 3.9 km, but would
require only ~129 meters in sandy fine gravel (Pang et al. 2005). The possibility of a
“shielding effect” conferred by particle association (Templeton et al. 2005) combined with
relatively high concentrations of coliphages (Chung 1993; Paul et al. 1993; Karim et al.
2004; Skraber et al. 2009; Yamahara et al. 2012) and enteric viruses (Smith et al. 1978;
LaBelle and Gerba 1979; Rao et al. 1984) typically recorded in sediments and soils (as
compared to the overlaying water columns), suggests that they can act as virus reservoirs. In
comparison, FIB appear to be similarly influenced by the soil type but less affected by the
velocity which is not surprising consider the straining effect of porous media (Ferguson
2003; Hijnen et al. 2005). Similar to coliphages, sediments can also act as reservoirs of FIB
(Yamahara et al. 2012). Human activities, such as boating and swimming, along with
changes in water currents and activities of wildlife, can resuspended and subsequently
physically desorb viruses and bacteria attached to sediment particles therefore potentially
increasing the viral loads in the water column (Ferguson 2003).

The effect of temperature on survival of bacteriophages is one of the most studied
environmental factors. Numerous experiments demonstrated extended survival at lower
temperatures in variety of matrices including sediments/soils (Hurst et al. 1980; Chung
1993; Gantzer et al. 2001; Ottosson and Stenstrom 2003), freshwaters (Long and Sobsey
2004; Skraber et al. 2004b; Yang and Griffiths 2013; Ravva and Sarreal 2016), marine water
(Chung 1993), wastewater (Moce-Llivina et al. 2003; McMinn et al. 2014), groundwater
(Yates et al. 1985; Gordon and Toze 2003) and tap water (Allwood et al. 2003). In general
FIB decay is accelerated compared to bacteriophages and enteric viruses at all of the
temperatures examined, while bacteriophages typically survived longer than infectious
enteric viruses (Yates et al. 1985; Chung 1993; Gantzer et al. 2001; Allwood et al. 2003;
Gordon and Toze 2003; Moce-Llivina et al. 2003; Skraber et al. 2004b; Charles et al. 2009).
Somatic coliphages typically persisted longer than the F+ group (Gantzer et al. 2001; MoceLlivina et al. 2003; McMinn et al. 2014), with different genotypes of the latter exhibiting
differential survival characteristics(Long and Sobsey 2004; Muniesa et al. 2009; Yang and
Griffiths 2013; Ravva and Sarreal 2016). Survival of Bacteroides spp. phages varied, with
some strains behaving more similarly to F+ (Duran et al. 2002; McMinn et al. 2014), while
others resembled somatic subgroup more closely (Duran et al. 2002; Moce-Llivina et al.
2003).

Another important factor for bacteriophage survival is sunlight and associated UV radiation.
Irrespective of the source of radiation (simulated or ambient sunlight), reported decay of
FIB, bacteriophages and enteric viruses were always lower in dark treatments as opposed to
sunlight exposed ones (Sinton et al. 1999; Sinton et al. 2002; Noble et al. 2004; Silverman et
al. 2013; United States Environmental Protection Agency 2015; Sun et al. 2016).
Comparable to the effect of temperature, FIB decay was always greater compared to that of
bacteriophages and viruses, but the magnitude of the effect on different microorganisms
seems to be at least somewhat dependent on the water type, as differential decay metrics are
reported for freshwater compared to marine waters (Sinton et al. 1999; Sinton et al. 2002;
Silverman et al. 2013; United States Environmental Protection Agency 2015). Sunlight
wavelength (UVA, UVB and visible spectrum) (Sinton et al. 1999; Sinton et al. 2002; Fisher
et al. 2011; Silverman et al. 2013; United States Environmental Protection Agency 2015;
Sun et al. 2016) as well as the presence of natural organic matter (Silverman et al. 2013;
United States Environmental Protection Agency 2015; Sun et al. 2016) are also reported to
influence the magnitude and type of bacteriophage inactivation (exogenous, direct and
indirect endogenous). Lastly, it is important to note that decay studies characterizing seeded
coliphage laboratory strains exhibit different transport and survival characteristics (Brion et
al. 2002; Long and Sobsey 2004; Ravva and Sarreal 2016) compared to indigenous
organisms. As a result, generalizations combining coliphage survival from spiking
experiments and environmental isolates is not prudent.

Summary
Bacteriophages are alternative fecal indicator organisms that are better suited than FIB to act
as surrogates for enteric viral pathogens presence and removal in built and natural
environments. Our review suggests that removal of bacteriophages through wastewater
treatment plants was more similar to that of infectious viral pathogens than FIB to infectious

viral pathogens, suggesting the potential advantage of their use as alternative viral indicators
in this arena. While bacteriophage densities in fresh and marine waters are lower compared
to FIB, but higher than viral pathogens, the accurate assessment of their concentrations is
confounded by the lack of recovery data for these matrices. Additionally, there is evidence
that bacteriophage fate and transport in the ambient waters may resemble that of viral
pathogens more closely than FIB and therefore bacteriophages may be promising surrogates
under some environmental conditions.

Reported and/or calculated log10 reduction of FIB, bacteriophages and viral pathogens
through wastewater treatment processes. Reduction data per organism type are pooled
irrespective of the particular unit of operation (e.g. primary treatment, secondary treatment,
disinfection). Box is delimited by 25th and 75th percentiles, solid line within the box
represents median and dashed line represents average. Whiskers are 10th and 90th percentile
values. Values outside of the range are depicted as filled dots. Number in parenthesis
indicate number of studies* used to derive the data.
