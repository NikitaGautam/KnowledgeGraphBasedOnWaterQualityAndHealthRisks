At Marine Bathing Beaches

Abstract: Findings are described from the second
year of an epidemiological-microbiological study conducted at New York City beaches as part of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency program to develop
health effects-recreational water quality criteria.
Symptomatology rates among swimmers (defined as
immersion of the head in the water) relative to nonswimming but beach-going controls at a "barely acceptable" (BA) beach and a "relatively unpolluted"
(RU) beach were examined. Data were collected by
contacting family groups at the beach on weekends,
obtaining information on bathing activity, and then
questioning them by phone some 8-10 days later. In

addition measurements were made for a number of potential water quality indicators.
It was observed that the symptom rates, categorized as gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, "other",
and "disabling" (stayed home, stayed in bed, consulted a physician), were higher among swimmers than
nonswimmers. As in the pretest conducted the previous year, the rate of GI symptoms was significantly
higher among swimmers relative to nonswimmers at
the BA but not the RU beach. Children, Hispanic
Americans, and the low-middle socioeconomic groups
were identified as the most susceptible portions of the
population. (Am J Public Health 69:690-696, 1979.)

Discharge via outfalls into ocean and estuarine waters
remains the most common means for the disposal of sewage
effluents by coastal communities. Therefore, there is a continuing requirement for sewage effluent guidelines, set on a
plant-by-plant basis and derived from criteria and guidelines
at potentially impacted targets such as bathing beaches and
shellfish-growing areas. Existing recreational water quality
criteria, guidelines, and standards have been reviewed by
McKee and Wolf in 1963,' by Senn, et al,2 in the same year
and, more recently, by Mechalas, et al.3 The microbiological
guideline for direct contact recreational waters recommended by the National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC)
to the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration in
1968,4 set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1976,5 and used in many states, is a geometric mean
fecal coliform density of 200 per 100 ml of water.* The guideline was based on findings reported by Stevenson in 19536

from epidemiological studies conducted on Lake Michigan
and the Ohio River. As noted by the Senn committee,2 Henderson,7 and many other workers since then,8 a major difficulty with the NTAC guidelines or any microbiological guideline or standard for recreational waters is the paucity of relevant epidemiological information and the seemingly contradictory findings from the two major efforts to obtain the required data, those of Moore9 and Stevenson.6 With regard to
the development of criteria, even the excellent analysis of a
recent outbreak of swimming-associated shigellosis'0 is wanting in that it does not provide data on the quality of the water
at the time of exposure, a frequent problem in the retrospective analyses of outbreaks. Henderson's and Moore's
objections notwithstanding, there is a requirement for health
effects, recreational water quality guidelines and standards.
If for no other reason, they are needed, as Shuval"I points
out, in setting design and operating criteria for municipal
sewage treatment plants and in locating their outfalls relative
to potential recreational resources.
Recognizing the need as stated above, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been conducting a program to develop health effects-recreational water quality criteria for marine and fresh waters. The overall program calls
for studies at a number of different geographic locations in
order to develop some general relationship between swimming-associated illness as measured by symptomatology, to
some potential microbial indicator of water quality. The results to be presented at this time were obtained during the
second year of the study at New York City beaches; appropriate data from the first year (pretest), are also presented.
Some of the findings from the pretest were described earlier. 12, 13

MICROBIAL INDICATORS AT MARINE BATHING BEACHES

Materials and Methods
The overall study at the New York City beaches, the
experimental design, and the rationale for the design relative
to those used in previous studies were described in an earlier
publication. I2 The study was conducted in three phases. The
first phase, a pretest of the epidemiological and microbiological methodology, was performed during the summer
of 1973; the second phase was conducted during the summer
of 1974. The major objective of the study was the examination of symptom rates for swimmers relative to nonswimming controls at a "barely acceptable" (BA) as compared to a "relatively unpolluted" (RU) beach. A barely acceptable beach was defined as the most "polluted" beach
available which was not posted as being unsafe for recreational use according to local criteria. A relatively unpolluted
beach was defined as a beach which was subject to the least
amount of pollution and at which the populations were demographically comparable to those at the BA beach.
The "important" illnesses and the "correct" indicators
of the quality of the water were treated as unknowns. Therefore, illness information was sought in the context of symptomatology; and measurements were made for a number of
potential water quality indicators. Briefly, the design consisted of a series of discrete study periods during which: 1)
the potential participants, primarily as family groups, were
contacted at the beach on weekends; 2) individuals who
swam in the midweeks immediately before and after the
week-end were eliminated from the study; 3) measurements
for a number of potential water quality indicators were made
during the course of the study periods at the test beaches;
and 4) follow-up information concerning symptomatology
and demographic characteristics was solicited by phone
some 8-10 days after the beach interview. The design differed from that used in Stevenson's prospective studies6 in
that swimming was defined more stringently as exposure of
the head to the water and discrete trials were conducted over
relatively short periods of times (1-2 days). Thereby, the effects of day-to-day variability in pollution level reaching the
test beaches were minimized. In addition, a beach-going but
nonswimming control population was obtained. During 1973
and 1974, an area in the vicinity of 20th Street at Coney Island was used as the BA beach, chosen because it is a heavily used beach area immediately adjacent to one that was
posted as unsafe for swimming according to local standards.
During 1974, Riis Park in the Rockaways was used as the RU
beach, a change from Rockaways 67th Street used in 1973.
The change was necessary in order to increase the size of the
study population. The densities of the various microbial indicators were comparable at both Rockaways beaches.
Beach activity information was used to categorize the
participants as either swimmers (in the water for 10 minutes
or more, head and face actually immersed therein) or nonswimmers. The symptoms for which queries were made and
the categories into which they were grouped will be described under "Results". An estimate of disability was obtained by asking whether the respondents remained home,
remained in bed, or sought medical advice; hospitalization
was not reported by any of the subjects, and the observation
AJPH July, 1979, Vol. 69, No. 7

period was too short to identify illnesses with long incubation periods. Demographic information included age,
sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as reflected by a
persons to rooms ratio.
Water samples were collected periodically during the
time of maximum swimming activity at the beaches. Two
samples were collected from each beach at approximately
1 1:00 am, 1:00 pm, 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm. The samples were
collected at chest depth approximately four inches below the
surface of the water. Upon collection, the samples were iced
and delivered to the laboratory where they were assayed
within eight hours of collection. Total and fecal coliform
densities were obtained using the most probable number procedure as described in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater.'4 The densities of total coliforms and the component genera thereof (Escherichia, Klebsiella, Citrobacter-Enterobacter) were also measured using
the mC procedure of Dufour and Cabelli.15 Enterococci,16
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,17 and Clostridium perfringens'8
densities were determined using membrane filter procedures
developed in this laboratory. Enterovirus densities were not
examined for a number of reasons including problems in
methodology and logistics. Shigellae were not quantified because of methodology problems. Salmonella densities were
not obtained during the second year of the study because of
the very low densities observed during the pretest.12
The symptom rates, categorized as respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), "other", and disabling, for swimmers and
nonswimmers at the BA and RU beaches were analyzed statistically by Cochran's two-way, chi-square analysis of association.'9 During the 1974 trials, in contrast to the pretest
conducted the previous year, gastrointestinal symptomatology was analyzed by demographic group in order to identify the sensitive portions of the populations. In addition,
during the 1974 trials, the credibility of the information obtained on GI symptomatology was examined by comparing
the rates and trends for total GI symptoms to those for the
"highly credible" portion thereof. "Highly credible" symptoms included all cases of vomiting, instances of diarrhea
which were accompanied by a fever or which were disabling,
and cases of nausea and stomachache which were accompanied by a fever.

Results
The data presented herein were obtained from follow-up
telephone questionnaires during the 1974 trials. As can be
seen from Table 1, the response rate to follow-up phone
questionnaires among individuals who gave a phone number
during the course of the beach interview was about 80 per
cent at both beaches. This response rate was considered satisfactory with the understanding that the findings have relevance only to that portion of the overall New York City population which have telephones. Only 2.6 per cent of the
beach interviewees did not have phones. An additional 19
per cent of those approached were either uncooperative during the beach interview, were midweek swimmers, or were
not from New York City.

The study population, individuals for whom follow-up
questionnaires were obtained and who did not swim in the
midweeks before and after a weekend trial, consisted of approximately 8,000 individuals in four subpopulations, swimmers and nonswimmers at the BA and RU beaches. They
were distributed demographically as shown in Table 2. The
demographic characteristics of the beach interviewees and
those successfully followed-up were comparable. The characteristics of the four subpopulations was not as comparable
in 1974 as in the 1973 pretest, particularly as regards ethnicity and persons/room ratio.
As in 1973, about two-thirds of the beachgoers were
classified as "swimmers"; and there were no striking differences between the Coney Island and the Rockaways populations with regard to the percentage so classified. Swimming was more frequent among males, Hispanic Americans,
and the 0-19 years of age groups. Of the nonswimmers at the
Coney Island and the Rockaways beaches, only 8.5 per cent
and 5.4 per cent respectively did not go swimming because
of existing symptoms or illness. None of the individuals at
the BA beach and only 0.1 per cent of those at the RU beach
did not go swimming because of GI symptomatology.
The attack rates for the various symptoms as reported
by telephone interview 8-10 days after the beach interview by
swimmers and nonswimmers at the two beaches are given in
Table 3. The most striking findings were the increases in the
rates of vomiting, diarrhea, and stomachache among swimmers relative to nonswimmers at the BA but not at the RU
beach. To a somewhat lesser extent, the same results were
obtained with the questions characterizing disability. Ear,
eye, nose, and skin symptomatology as well as fever were
higher among swimmers than non-swimmers at both
beaches.
The rates for the broad categories, themselves (gastrointestinal, respiratory, other, and disabling) for swimmers
and nonswimmers at both beaches, with the levels of significance as determined from Cochran's two-way chi-square
analysis of association for the 1974 data are shown in Table
4. Except for the "'other" category, the rates were higher for
*33 percent at the Coney Island (BA) beach and 7.5 per cent at

swimmers than for nonswimmers at both beaches, but the differentials in rates (swimmers minus nonswimmers) were
higher at the BA than at the RU beach. The only statistically
significant difference was the GI symptoms between swimmers and non-swimmers at the BA beach. The attack rates
for the four subpopulations (swimmers and nonswimmers at
both beaches) were adjusted for each demographic category
relative to that for the total samples (Table 5). The differential in rates for gastrointestinal and disabling symptoms
at both beaches were not changed appreciably by the adjustments.*
The results from the analysis of GI symptom rates by
demographic groups for swimmers and nonswimmers at both
beaches are presented in Table 6. The rates among children,
Hispanic-Americans, and low-middle socioeconomic individuals who swam at Coney Island were significantly and
appreciably higher than among those who did not. This was
not so for the residual from each demographic category
(adults, blacks plus whites, and the highest SES group). The
GI symptom rates for nonswimmers among the children at
the RU beach were appreciably higher than those for the corresponding groups at the BA beach. The rate for nonswimming children at the RU beach was significantly higher
than that for children who swam.
Secondary transmission of illnesses within a family
could provide an erroneous picture of the symptom rates associated with swimming. Therefore, those instances in
which more than one individual in a family group reported
gastrointestinal symptoms were identified in the telephone
interview. There were 24 such instances, 13 at the BA beach
and 11 at the RU beach. In all but three, two at the BA beach
and one at the RU beach, the onset of symptoms for any two
members of the same household was within a two-day period.
The credibility of the information on gastrointestinal
symptomatology was assessed by comparing the trends of all
responses to those considered "highly credible".** The
rates for the "highly credible" symptoms among the four
study groups were examined for the total population and
separately for children, Hispanic-Americans, and the low to
middle socioeconomic groups. The trends for the highly credible portion (Table 7) were similar to those for all GI symptoms (Table 6). Rates of "highly credible" GI symptoms for
the three most sensitive groups of swimmers also were significantly higher than those for their nonswimming controls.
Microbiological findings are presented in Table 8. Appreciable and statistically significant differences in the densities of a number of potential water quality indicators were
obtained at the BA as compared to the RU beach. These
findings were similar to those obtained the previous year.12
*
The 1974 data for disabling GI symptoms by type were not analyzed statistically because of the small size of the resultant cells.
The disabling GI symptom rate for swimmers was 10/1000 higher
than that for non swimmers at the BA beach. At the RU beach, the
rate for nonswimmers was higher than that for swimmers by 2/1000.

** 1) all cases of vomiting, 2) cases of diarrhea accompanied by
a fever or a disability response, and 3) cases of nausea and stom-

achache accompanied by a fever.

Discussion
The data presented herein suggest that there are measurable health effects associated with swimming in sewage
polluted waters. These effects are manifest primarily as relatively high rates of gastrointestinal symptoms among children. Although no hospitalization was reported, the symptoms were severe enough in about one-half the cases for the
individual to remain home, stay in bed, or seek medical ad-

vice. These effects occur at pollution levels below most
existing guidelines and standards as seen from microbial indicator densities. They are consistent with those reported
during the pretest year12 and those reported by Stevenson
from the Ohio River study.6 They are not inconsistent with
those reported by Moore9 since neither poliomyelitis nor salmonellosis were reported in the present study.
There are a number of questions concerning the design
and results of the study which might affect the conclusions
drawn. The credibility of symptoms as reported by the participants or their parents could be questioned in the absence
of follow-up clinical and laboratory findings. An attempt was
made to obtain such follow-up information during the pretest. However, the relatively benign nature of the symptoms,
the lack of response of the study population to our request
for a phone call at their onset, and logistic considerations
made this impossible. The alternative was the analysis of
"highly credible" symptoms (as described); we interpret the
findings obtained as indicative of credible reporting on the
part of the respondents.
Demographic differences among the four study populations, particularly those relating to age, ethnicity, and persons/room ratio, could have confounded analysis of the data
and the conclusions drawn. However, the generally obtained
demographic comparability of the swimmers to their nonswimming controls, the absence of appreciable differences in
the residual rates for GI and disabling illnesses when the

rates were adjusted, and the results of the analysis of GI
symptomatology by demographic grouping tend to minimize
this possibility.
There is the concern with the higher rates for GI symptoms among the nonswimmers at the Rockaways relative to
those at Coney Island, especially since the swimmer rates
for the two beaches generally were not significantly different
from each other. There are a number of beach, home, and
population factors which could produce this situation. For
this reason, the study was designed so that the control population for the swimmers was nonswimmers at the same
beach.
The anomolous finding of a significantly higher rate of
TABLE 7-Attack Rates for "Highly Credible"a Gastrointestinal

Symptoms

GI symptoms for nonswimmers relative to swimmers at the
RU beach probably was not due to overreporting, since this
was also true of the "highly credible" portion. The nonswimming children may have been more prone to illness, although only 0.1 per cent of these children or their respondents reported that they did not swim because of existent GI
symptoms. We favor the explanation that predominantly
white or black, higher SES children did not or were not allowed to swim because they were in the early stages of the
illnesses for which they later reported symptoms.
The finding of a statistically significant, swimming-associated rate of GI symptomatology at a "barely acceptable"
but not at a "relatively unpolluted" beach shows that beach
effects can be measured and suggests that measurable health
effects do occur even within existing guidelines and standards. However, these results do not speak to the overall
objective of this program, the development of criteria amenable to risk analysis. This is perceived as a dose-response
type relationship of swimming-associated GI symptomatology to the quality of the water as determined from the
most appropriate water quality indicator. Additional data
from other locations will be needed and are being obtained to
achieve this objective.

Nathalie Masse Memorial Committee*

In 1976, many friends of Dr. Nathalie Masse* established a Memorial to perpetuate her memory: to
fulfill this purpose a fellowship and an international prize were created.
1) The Nathalie Massee Research Fellowship
This fellowship (granted in even-numbered years) was awarded last year for the first time for a
research on nutrition education in a socially deprived region of South America.
The next fellowship, to be awarded in 1980, is likewise intended for young research workers. It is
intended to help them in their projects directed to problems in social and preventive pediatrics.

2) The International Nathalie Masse Prize
This prize, amounting to 10,000 French francs, will be awarded for the first time in 1979, and every
2 years thereafter.
It is intended as compensation for an original work concerning childhood, prepared by an institution or an individual under 40 years of age, with a view to encouraging studies by young professionals or
research workers.
In both cases, the winners will be chosen without regard to nationality by an international jury.
The detailed rules concerning the Fellowship and the Prize, as well as application forms, may be
obtained by writing to Memorial Committee, International Children's Centre, Chaiteau de Longchamp,
Bois de Boulogne, 75016 Paris.
*Dr. Nathalie Masse, who died in 1975, was director of teaching at the International Children's Centre for 18
years. She made major contributions to the improvement of child health internationally.
