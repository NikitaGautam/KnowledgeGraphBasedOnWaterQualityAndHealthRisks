Background. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for childhood sporadic reportable enteric
infection (REI) caused by bacteria, specifically Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, or Shigella (REI-B).
Methods. Matched case-control study. Case patients aged ⬍19 years who were reported to 3 Washington State
county health departments and matched control subjects were interviewed from November 2003-November 2005.
Matched odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by using conditional logistic regression. Population attributable risk
percentages were calculated for exposures associated with infection.
Results. Two hundred ninety-six case patients were matched to 580 control subjects. Aquatic recreation was the
most important factor associated with all REI-Bs studied (beach water exposure [OR for Salmonella infection, 28.3
{CI, 7.2–112.2}; OR for Shigella infection, 14.5 {CI 1.5–141.0} or any recreational water exposure [OR for Campylobacter infection, 2.7 {CI, 1.5– 4.8}; OR for Escherichia coli O157 infection, 7.4 {CI, 2.1–26.1}]). Suboptimal kitchen
hygiene after preparation of raw meat or chicken (OR, 7.1 [CI, 2.1–24.1]) and consumption of food from restaurants
were additional risks for Campylobacter infection. Infection with Salmonella was associated with the use of private
wells as sources of drinking water (OR, 6.5 [CI, 1.4 –29.7]), and the use of residential septic systems was a risk for both
Salmonella (OR, 3.2 [CI, 1.3–7.8]) and E. coli (OR, 5.7 [CI, 1.2–27.2]) O157 infection.
Conclusions. Overall, non-food exposures were as important as food-related exposures with regard to their
contributions to the proportion of cases. Infection prevention efforts should address kitchen hygiene practices and
non-food exposures, such as recreational water exposure, in addition to food-consumption risks.
Approximately 100,000 infections caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, and Shigella
are reported annually to local health departments
(LHDs) in the United States [1], making them the most
common reportable enteric infections (REIs) caused by
bacteria (REI-B). Most REI-Bs occur among children

[2– 4], and it is estimated that dozens of additional infections occur for each case reported [1]. Outbreaks of
REI-B represent ongoing public health problems that
receive considerable attention in the media and scientific literature [5–11]. However, current data suggest
that up to 90% of REI-B is sporadic, that is, not outbreak
related [1]. While specific foods are the transmission vehicles most often identified in outbreak investigations
[6 – 8, 11, 12], food preparation and kitchen hygiene
practices, as well as non-food vehicles (e.g., exposure to
water and/or animals), might play more important roles
than particular foods per se (e.g., undercooked meat) in
the transmission of sporadic disease [13–19].
Because of the higher incidence of REI-B among children, limited data on the modes by which non-outbreak
REI-Bs are acquired, and the possibility that infection
control lessons learned from outbreaks might not apply

to a great number of sporadic infections, we conducted a prospective case-control study to identify associations between sporadic childhood REI-B and a diverse and comprehensive panel of
plausible exposures. Our overall goal was to identify the modifiable risk factors associated with the greatest proportion of
cases.

Table 1. Exposure variables evaluated in pathogen-specific
questionnaires administered to case patients and control subjects.

METHODS

research assistants (for control subjects) interviewed the caregiver most familiar with the food and activity histories of the
participant. Participants ⬎9 years old were encouraged to participate in interviews. Case patients were interviewed as
promptly as possible after their infection was reported; control
subjects were contacted as soon as possible after the case patient
was interviewed, but always within 4 months to maintain temporal matching. Case patients and control subjects were asked
about the same exposure interval, counting back from the onset
of illness and the date of the interview, respectively. The study
was approved by the Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical
Center and Washington University institutional review boards.
Statistical analysis. We performed descriptive and pathogenspecific univariate and multivariate analyses using Stata (version
9; Statacorp). We used conditional logistic regression for univariate and multivariate analyses of all surveyed exposures to calculate matched odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). To adjust for confounding by demographic and socioeconomic factors, the multivariate analysis included those variables
associated with disease status, including matching variables if
there was residual confounding. We then further adjusted for
exposure variables that were associated with both disease and
exposures of interest. We only present these latter estimates if
they meaningfully differed from those models solely adjusted for
socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic characteristics.
For variables with statistically significant associations (P ⬍ .05)
in the final regression models, we calculated population attributable risk percentages (PAR%) and 95% CIs adjusted for SES
and demographic variables by bootstrap methodology [23] to
estimate the magnitude of each factor’s relative contribution to
disease occurrence. It should be noted that PAR% sums can exceed 100% because the cumulative effects of multiple factors are
not necessarily additive [24].

Study design and population. We performed a matched casecontrol study of selected REI-Bs among children in King, Whatcom, and Yakima Counties in Washington. A case patient was
defined as a resident of these counties younger than 19 years who
had laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Salmonella, or Shigella infection, reported to a LHD during a 24month period that commenced in November 2003. These counties had combined 2005 populations of ⬃490,000 individuals
⬍19 years of age [20]. Exclusion criteria were undefined onset of
illness, immigration to the United States or Canada in the 6
months before illness onset, travel outside either of these countries during the exposure period, belonging to a recognized cluster of illness involving ⬎1 household or belonging to a cluster
within a single household and not being the individual who had
the earliest onset of symptoms. The following pathogen-specific
exposure periods were based on published data: Campylobacter,
2–7 days; E. coli O157, 2– 8 days; Salmonella, 6 h–5 days; Shigella,
1– 4 days [2, 21, 22].
Control subjects. Potential control subjects were identified
at family practice and pediatric clinics in the study area by prospective distribution of multilingual printed materials that explained study goals. Parents who were willing to enroll their children as potential control subjects were asked to provide basic
demographic characteristics and contact information. For each
case patient interviewed, we identified and then contacted the 2
best control subject matches from the pool of potential control
subjects by using a computer algorithm that matched age (closest ⫾ 50%, up to 19 years of age), zip code (same or adjacent zip
code, to reduce confounding by socioeconomic and/or demographic characteristics), and sex (when possible). Control subject exclusion criteria included the same travel and residency
restrictions as for case patients, as well as diarrhea in the preceding 30 days, a sibling chosen as a control subject for the same case
patient, or previous study participation.
Questionnaires and interviews. We developed standardized, pathogen-specific questionnaires that addressed domestic
travel; dining venues; food handling, preparation, and consumption practices; water supply and sanitation; animal and
recreational water exposures; and demographic characteristics
(table 1, which appears only in the electronic version of the Journal). All interviewers were trained in the use of the survey instrument. After determining eligibility and obtaining consent, the

RESULTS
Study population
During the study period, 546 pediatric REI-Bs were reported;
237 were due to Campylobacter, 190 to Salmonella, 67 to Shigella,
and 52 to E. coli O157. Of 546 patients with REI-B, 61 (11.2%),
50 (9.2%), and 31 (5.7%) patients were excluded because they
had traveled outside the United States or Canada, were part of
recognized outbreaks involving ⬎1 household, or for other reasons, respectively (figure 1). Of the 404 remaining case patients,
296 (73.3%) participated, including 151 patients with Campy-

lobacter infection, 86 with Salmonella infection, 39 with E. coli
O157 infection, and 20 with Shigella infection. Ineligible and
nonparticipating case patients were less likely to be white but
otherwise resembled participants (table 2, which appears only in
the electronic version of the Journal). A mean of 1.97 control
subjects participated per case patient (SD, 0.40; range, 1– 4 patients). The median time from onset of illness to case patient
interview was 11 days (75th percentile, 19 days; 90th percentile,
25 days), and the median time from case patient interview to
control subject interview was 27 days (75th percentile, 45 days;
90th percentile, 69 days).
The 296 case patients and 580 matched control subjects were
similar in terms of sex, eligibility for low-income services, ethnicity, housing type, and urban or rural residence, but case patients were less likely to be white, overall had parents with a lower
level of education, had smaller household sizes, and were more
likely to be the only child in a household (table 3, which appears
only in the electronic version of the Journal). Also, despite agematching, residual age differences between case patients and
control subjects remained (0.2 years aggregate median difference).

Risk factor analysis
Various exposures were associated with each REI-B studied. ORs
for dichotomous and categorical variables, both unadjusted and
adjusted for SES and demographic variables associated with disease status (as noted in table 4 and table 3, which appears only in
the electronic version of the Journal), with P values ⬍.05 in the
adjusted models are presented in tables 4 and 5, respectively. All
point estimates discussed below refer to adjusted estimates.
PAR% adjusted for SES and demographic variables are presented in table 6.
Travel and commercial food venues. Domestic travel (defined as an overnight stay away from home within the United
States or Canada) was associated with Campylobacter infection
(table 4; OR, 2.5 [CI, 1.4 – 4.6]) and E. coli O157 infection (OR,
6.8 [CI, 1.6 –28.5]). Consumption of foods from mobile food
stands and fast-food or table-service restaurants were risk factors
for Campylobacter infection. Eating food from self-serve buffets,
mobile stands, or table-service restaurants was associated with E.
coli O157 infection.

Multivariate ORs were adjusted for the socioeconomic status and demographic variables associated with infection due to
individual pathogens, which were as follows: C—age, race, housing type, and parental education level; Sm—age, race, and no.
of children in household; E—age, parental education level, and no. of children in household; Sh—age and housing type. There
was a statistically significant association between Hispanic ethnicity and shigellosis, however, we were unable to adjust for
ethnicity due to convergence issues as 67% and 100% of control subjects and case patients, respectively, were of Hispanic
ethnicity.
b
The ORs for these exposure variables approached the null value of 1 when further adjusted for other potentially
confounding exposure variables. Hence population attributable risk percentages were not calculated for these variables.

Food handling and preparation practices. Campylobacter
infection was associated with raw meat and poultry exposures,
including handling of these foods (table 4), in-home practices
related to thawing these foods, and cleaning methods used for
the surfaces (e.g., cutting boards, sinks, or counters) on which
these items were prepared (table 5). Among participants from
households that prepared raw meat or poultry, there was no
significant difference between the reference group (who placed
the meat directly in a cooking pan without allowing the meat to
touch other preparation surfaces) and those who bleached the
preparation surfaces or washed them in a dishwasher. The risk
Table 5.

was highest in households where surfaces were washed with soap
and water only (OR compared to reference group, 3.0 [CI, 1.2–
7.6]) or merely wiped following use (OR compared to reference
group, 7.1 [CI, 2.1–24.1]). Risk did not vary between those who
used plastic cutting boards and those who used wooden cutting
boards. Food handling and preparation practices were not significantly associated with Salmonella or E. coli O157 infection
(data not shown).

Data on clean-up methods were only collected for people who prepared raw meat. The
population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) represents the percentage of disease that
would be prevented by changing clean-up methods among those who prepared raw meat
in the household.

This categorical variable is presented as a dichotomized variable for PAR% calculation
purposes. The risk represents comparison between the exposed group—those who
washed with soap, rinsed, or wiped the surfaces vs. the reference—those who disinfected
with bleach, washed in dishwasher, used a disposable surface, or placed raw meat in a
cooking pan without allowing it to touch other preparation surfaces.



shrimp prepared from raw states at home was a risk factor for
Salmonella infection. Consumption of unpasteurized milk was
associated with Campylobacter infection, however, the OR approached 1 when potentially confounding exposure variables
(e.g., farm animal contact) were included in the model. Consumption of raw herbs, particularly cilantro, was a risk for
Campylobacter infection (OR for cilantro, 5.3 [CI, 2.6 –10.9])
and Shigella infection (OR for cilantro, 45.0 [CI, 7.9 –256.5]).
Raw sprout consumption and simply having sprouts in the
home without consumption were risk factors for Salmonella infection (OR, 7.7 [CI, 1.2– 47.7] and 3.2 [CI, 1.2– 8.1], respectively).
Eating raw vegetables was associated with a lower risk of Salmonella infection. This association was seen among those who
ate meat and poultry, as well as among those who consumed a
vegetarian diet. Consumption of raw organic vegetables was also
potentially protective, even when assessed only among those
who consumed raw vegetables. However, among those who ate
raw spinach or lettuce, consumption of these products from
sealed retail bags was associated with Salmonella infection. E. coli
O157 infection was not associated with any specific foods—including beef, ground or otherwise—prepared at commercial or
home venues.
Animals. The presence of farm animals, especially poultry,
at home properties was significantly associated with Campylobacter infection (OR for poultry, 3.3 [CI, 1.3– 8.2]). Approximately half of the participants who had livestock on their property also had poultry and vice versa; this correlation precluded
adjustment for these variables. Exposure to livestock and poultry
away from the home property was not a risk among participants
who did not live on property with such animals.
Water and domestic waste system exposures. Drinking
untreated water from a lake, stream, river, or garden hose was a
risk for Campylobacter infection. Dishwasher use was inversely
associated with E. coli O157 infection.
Salmonella infection was associated with the use of a private
well as a home drinking water source (OR, 6.5 [CI, 1.4 –29.7]).
Furthermore, Salmonella and E. coli O157 infections were both
associated with the use of a septic system for home wastewater
disposal (OR, 3.2 [CI, 1.3–7.8] and 5.7 [CI, 1.2–27.2], respectively), though only 1 participant (a case patient) reported a
known septic system failure.
Recreational water activity. Aquatic recreation activities
were associated with and contributed a high proportion of cases
for each REI-B (table 6). For example, playing or swimming in
natural sources of water (either fresh or saltwater) was strongly
related to Campylobacter infection (OR, 3.4 [CI, 1.4 – 8.4];
PAR%, 10.8% [CI, 3.6%–19.4%]), Salmonella infection (OR,
28.3 [CI, 7.2–112.2]; PAR%, 20.7% [CI, 12.8%–31.4%]), and
Shigella infection (OR, 14.5 [CI, 1.5–141.0]; PAR%, 27.9% [CI,
4.5%– 47.4%]), but not E. coli O157 infection. However, recreational water exposure in general (e.g., playing in beach water, in

a pool, and in backyard “kiddie” pools) was associated with a
7-fold increased risk of E. coli O157 infection (PAR%, 44.4%
[CI, 25.7%– 67.4%]).
Breast-feeding, hygiene, and ill contacts. Illnesses were
not associated with frequency of hand washing, exposure to individuals using diapers, the use of antibiotic soaps or alcoholbased gels, or day care attendance. A lack of association with day
care attendance was also observed in various subanalyses that
were restricted by age, size of child-care facilities, attendance of
children in diapers, and informal and/or unlicensed places of
care. A history of breast-feeding was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of infection with Salmonella but the association was not statistically significant (data not shown; OR, 0.5
[CI, 0.2–1.1]).
Campylobacter and Shigella infections were associated with
contact with another person who had had diarrhea, but without
laboratory diagnosis of the REI-B. A separate sensitivity analysis
that eliminated case patients and control subjects who had had
such contacts from the model substantially reduced matched
odds ratios and resulted in confidence intervals spanning 1.0 for
all other exposure variables for Shigella (data not shown). No
substantial changes in point estimates or confidence intervals
resulted from the Campylobacter sensitivity analysis.
DISCUSSION
This study has various implications. Most notably, non-food
transmission vehicles appeared to be as important as food exposures in the transmission of the enteric infections examined in
this study.
In particular, water used for recreational swimming or playing
contributed a leading proportion of all REI-Bs. Although recreational water exposure has been implicated in many REI-B outbreaks [10, 25, 26] and beach water (without known contamination) has been identified as a risk for nonspecific diarrheal
illnesses [27, 28], this is the first study to identify this association
with sporadic microbiologically confirmed REI-Bs in the United
States and the apparent magnitude of this association was surprisingly large. Most other studies of sporadic REI-Bs have not
examined recreational water exposure, and those that did have
not identified such associations [29, 30]. Swimming in beach
water has been identified as a risk factor for enterohemorrhagic
E. coli infection (including, but not specifically limited to, infection with E. coli O157) and Campylobacter infection in Germany
and Finland, respectively [17, 18]. Recreational water exposure
is a plausible and potentially important risk factor for infection
and merits further investigation.
We identified other non-food associations, some of which
corroborate other studies and others that are novel associations
in the context of sporadic infection. For example, the risk observed here of sporadic Campylobacter infection as a result of
drinking untreated surface water is in agreement with other re-

ports [14 –16], but the use of private well water and the use of
septic systems have not been previously reported to be associated
with sporadic infection. Our data also refine previously reported
associations. For example, animal exposure as a risk for Campylobacter infection in our study was limited to children who had
animals at their residence. Attention has focused on pathogen
transmission in public petting zoos [5, 9, 31–34], and recommendations to mitigate risk in these settings have been disseminated [35]. However, a different focus might be necessary for
people living with such animals.
Some food-related exposures warrant comment. Sprouts and
cilantro, recognized transmission vehicles in outbreaks [7, 8,
36 –38], were demonstrated to be associated with sporadic Salmonella and Campylobacter infection, respectively, but only cilantro contributed to disease burden. Suboptimal kitchen hygiene practices (i.e., not using bleach or dishwashers) after
preparation of raw meat and poultry contributed an important
proportion of Campylobacter infections, similar to recent findings from France [13]. Handling practices for raw poultry and
the consumption of meat or poultry prepared from raw states at
home also contributed to the incidence of Campylobacter infection.
Eating foods from fast-food and table-service restaurants contributed especially to the incidence of Campylobacter and E. coli
O157 infection (table 6), respectively, as has been previously
reported [19, 30, 39]. Interestingly, the risk of Campylobacter
and E. coli O157 infection associated with domestic travel did
not appear to be related to eating food from commercial venues,
as the risk was not modified by adjusting for any of the restaurant
type exposures. Perhaps this risk relates to hygiene lapses during
family travel.
Our data also suggest a possible protective food association.
Vegetable consumption in general was associated with lowered
risk of Salmonella infection, an effect that has been reported for
E. coli O157 [30, 40] and Campylobacter [16]. However, the association is complex; consuming fresh lettuce or spinach that
came from sealed retail bags was associated with an increased
risk of Salmonella infection among those who ate fresh lettuce or
spinach. This hazard is exemplified by recent outbreaks of E. coli
O157 infection and Salmonella infection caused by bagged, prewashed fresh produce in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively [6, 12]. While contaminated produce is an
important vehicle of transmission for enteric pathogens, other
studies have also pointed out the overall benefit of a diet that
includes vegetables. The mechanisms that mediate this effect appear to extend beyond the mere replacement of potentially riskier foods (e.g., those of animal origin) with vegetables, and may
rather result from the benefits of a diet that is diverse and provides protective micronutrients [16, 30, 40].
Interestingly, we did not find that chicken or egg consumption increased the risk for infection with Salmonella, despite reports of such associations with sporadic infection [41, 42]. It is

possible that subgroups of Salmonella might have vehiclespecific risks that were not discernible because of limited numbers for each serotype and/or differences in prevalence of serotypes associated with such foods in our study area. Also, despite
oft-cited associations between ground beef consumption and E.
coli O157 infection [30, 40, 43, 44], our finding that there was no
association is consistent with reports of reduced proportions of
recent sporadic cases associated with ground beef exposure [30].
This decline might be related to industry and consumer interventions subsequent to highly publicized outbreaks [45] and to
regulatory changes.
The lack of association between hand-washing practices and
day care attendance and risk of infection was also unexpected.
The possibility exists that these risk factors have been mitigated
by regulations at child-care facilities and by education; however,
further study is necessary to verify the absence of association.
This study has several limitations. We relied on self-reported
behaviors, which do not always reflect actual practices, particularly when the practices are suspected to be associated with infection; however, this limitation is inherent in interviewgarnered data. Despite efforts to minimize differences, different
interviewers could have introduced biases. Findings from our
tri-county study area might not be generalizable to broader populations. Despite our attempts to control for seasonal exposures
by interviewing control subjects as soon as possible after case
patients were identified, the interval between case patient and
control subject interviews might have skewed results pertaining
to season-dependent risks. However, a subanalysis limited only
to case-control pairs who were interviewed ⬍2 months apart did
not alter study findings (data not shown). The voluntary control
subjects were not a probability sample of the study base. Sample
sizes were insufficient to permit in-depth risk factor–pathogen
associations, particularly for very common or uncommon exposures. Zip code matching might underestimate risks related to
geography, such as drinking water supply, sanitation sources,
and animal exposure. It is difficult to completely measure and
therefore adjust for all SES characteristics that could confound
associations. Associations with Shigella infection should be
noted with caution, as we could not adjust for differences in
Hispanic ethnicity between Shigella case patients and control
subjects because of model convergence issues.
Despite these limitations, our tri-county study of childhood
REI-Bs adds important information about the epidemiology of
sporadic REI-Bs, which are much more common than outbreakrelated cases. Similar studies have examined broader geographic
and age distributions, but risks specific to more defined populations might have been obscured. Our data were also restricted to
domestically acquired infection; many studies have previously
documented the risk associated with foreign travel [2, 19, 46 –
50]. These age, travel, and geographic eligibility boundaries
likely explain differences between some of our point estimates,
particularly PAR%, and those of other studies. The convergence



of associations with data from other studies that involved populations more diverse in age and geographical location, such as
FoodNet [19, 30, 39], a multistate sporadic REI-B study network, and a recent countrywide study in France [13] strengthen
the validity of these findings. Associations corroborated in this
study include the consumption of table-service restaurant food
and infection with E. coli O157 and Campylobacter; and the association of chicken prepared at home, drinking untreated surface water, and poor kitchen hygiene with Campylobacter infection [13, 16, 19, 30, 39].
In summary, this study of risks related to sporadic childhood
REI-Bs provides a framework in which to consider interventions
that might reduce REI-B incidence by weighing relative risks
against frequencies of exposures via PAR% calculations. These
data suggest that non-food exposures pose risks that are comparable in magnitude to those of food exposures. Moreover,
kitchen hygiene may play as important a role as the actual consumption of specific foods. Interventions should focus on risks
that, if confirmed, make a large contribution to disease incidence
(i.e., those with high PAR%). In contrast, control of “high-risk”
(and often high-profile) but low-prevalence exposures (e.g.,
consumption of sprouts) might have relatively little overall benefit. Interventions focused on safe recreational water, enhanced
access to municipal water and sanitation systems, food-handling
education, and improved safety of food sold at fast-food and
table-service restaurants might more effectively and rapidly reduce the incidence of domestically acquired REI-Bs.
