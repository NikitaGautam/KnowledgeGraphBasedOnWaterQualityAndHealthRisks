Abstract
Background: The diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis can be carried out by non-molecular techniques such as electron
microscopy (EM), enzyme-immunoassay and latex agglutination tests and various molecular techniques. Normally
molecular detection requires the use of three separate protocols to detect the three main causes of viral gastroenteritis,
adenoviruses, rotaviruses and norwalk-like viruses (NLV) which have different types of nucleic acid. The development
of a sensitive and specific assay which could detect these targets would have major advantages for the clinical virology
laboratory. Objectives: The aims of the present study were to develop a sensitive and specific multiplex molecular assay
and to apply it to the detection of viral agents in clinical cases of acute gastroenteritis. Study design: The multiplex assay
was designed using Access RT-PCR (Promega). Primers were researched and selected for their specificity and broad
range detection of the viral agents across the various genotypes of group A rotaviruses, NLV and group F adenoviruses.
Results: From September 2000 to August 2001 we tested 1945 clinical specimens. Rotavirus infections were detected in
190 with an age range from 12 days to 8 years old. Group F adenovirus was detected in 96 patients ranging from 15
days to 10 years old. A further single case of group F adenovirus was detected in an adult of 75 years old. NLVs were
detected in 132 patients. There were 55 infections in children less than 7 years old. In 10 different outbreaks involving
130 adult patients there were 57 NLV positives. Sporadic NLV infection was detected in 11 of 600 adult patients. There
were 4 patients with dual infections. Conclusions: The assay detailed here has proved an invaluable tool for the
investigation of acute gastroenteritis in specimens from patients of all ages. We found it convenient to use a single
mastermix with a single protocol to test all specimens from patients of all ages. NLV in children is often overlooked
and/or under reported, particularly where less sensitive assays such as EM are being employed for diagnosis.

epidemic gastroenteritis outbreaks in adults and
children (Caceres et al., 1998; Grimwood et al.,
1995; Hicks et al., 1996; Kapikian and Chanock,
1996a; Kim et al., 1990; Oppermann et al., 2001).
These viruses are associated with hospital admissions of children and adults and nosocomial
infections in both adults and children (Aho et al.,
2000; Hjelt et al., 1985; Oppermann et al., 2001;
Pina et al., 2000). A rapid definitive diagnosis is
particularly important in hospitalised patients.
Effective management of community and hospital
outbreaks of gastroenteritis commonly requires
the formation of multi-professional infection control teams and can result in ward or hospital
closure and restriction in use of other facilities
such as restaurants, nursing homes and cruise
ships. (Chadwick et al., 2000; Luthi et al., 1996;
MMWR Recomm Rep., 2001; Russo et al., 1997).
The challenge for the clinical virology laboratory
is to provide a sensitive and specific test for
detection of each of the viruses implicated in cases
of gastroenteritis. Conventionally electron microscopy (EM), latex agglutination and nucleic acid
amplification techniques (NAT) are used either
individually or in combination (Curry et al., 1999;
Johansson et al., 1990; O’Neill et al., 2001;
Thomas et al., 1994). To simplify the diagnostic
process a single sensitive and specific technique is
preferred. The obvious choice for the diagnostic
laboratory is to use a single molecular technique
which is the only methodology with adequate
sensitivity to detect all three virus targets. However
this is complicated by several factors. The three
main viral causes of gastroenteritis normally
require three separate protocols for their detection.
The adenovirus genome is double stranded DNA,
the NLV genome is positive-sense single stranded
RNA and the rotaviruses have a segmented double
stranded RNA genome (Estes, 1996; Kapikian et
al., 1996b; Shenk, 1996). Primer selection is also an
important consideration given the heterogeneity of
NLV genotypes and the possibility of different
rotavirus genotypes in a given population. Previously we reported a one-step nested RT-PCR for
the detection of NLVs (O’Neill et al., 2001). We
have further developed this approach to incorporate targets for rotavirus and group F adenovirus
in a new nested multiplex RT-PCR (nmRT-PCR)

and applied the new test to specimens from
patients of all ages with suspected viral gastroenteritis.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Specimens and patients
Faecal specimens were received at the regional
virus laboratory from patients with gastroenteritis.
The specimens were prepared as 10% suspensions
in Eagles medium with Earles salts, centrifuged at
4000/g for 10 min and the clear supernatant
either stored at /20 8C or tested before freezing.
For nmRT-PCR the specimens were further prepared using the QIAGEN DNA Blood extraction
kit which co-extracts RNA and DNA. Specimens
were extracted using either the QIAGEN 9604
Robot or a vacuum manifold developed in house.
The nucleic acid was eluted from the spin columns
using 50 ml of nuclease free water. The nucleic acid
extracts were tested by nmRT-PCR immediately
or stored at /20 8C until tested the following
day. The 10% faecal suspensions known to be
positive for viruses, which were used in the
validation process, had been stored at /20 8C
for up to 3 years prior to use.
2.2. Nested multiplex RT-PCR
The nmRT-PCR was developed using Access
RT-PCR (Promega) for the first round and conventional PCR for the second round in 10 ml
volumes and was based on a previously published
nRT-PCR for NLV (O’Neill et al., 2001). The
primers were specific for the hexon gene of group
F adenoviruses, the VP7 gene of group A rotaviruses and the polymerase gene of NLV and are
shown in Table 1. Some primers were previously
published and others were designed and selected
with the aid of DNASTAR software. This was done
by aligning representative strains of group F
adenovirus and of the genotypes of group A
rotavirus using Meg Align and the primers were
designed with the aid of Primer Select. The nmRTPCR was systematically optimised with respect to
primer and magnesium ion concentrations using

conventional laboratory procedures. The final
mastermixes are given below.
For first round nmRT-PCR 2 ml of extracted
nucleic acid from specimens was added to 8 ml of
mastermix to give a final volume of 10 ml. The first
round final 10 ml volume contained Access RTPCR buffer (Promega), 0.6 mM NLV outer primers A and B, 0.2 mM rotavirus primers A and B
and 0.2 mM adenovirus group F primers A and B,
1.5 mM MgSO4, 1 unit AMV, 1 unit Tfl, 0.2 mM
NTP, 0.04 mM cresol red and 12% sucrose. Cresol
red and sucrose was added to facilitate direct gel
loading. The nmRT-PCR first round cycling
conditions were as follows; 48 8C/20 min, 94 8C/
3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 8C/30 s, 37 8C/
30 s and 72 8C/30 s. This was followed by 72 8C 5
min and finally a hold step at 20 8C.
For second round PCR 0.2 ml of first round
product was added to 9.8 ml of second round
mastermix to give a final volume of 10 ml. The
second round contained Tris buffer, 0.25 units
TAQ in storage buffer B (Promega), 0.2 mM NTP,
3.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM nested primers C and D
for each of the three viral targets, 0.25 mM cresol
red and 15% sucrose. The second round PCR
cycling conditions were as follows; 94 8C/2 min
followed by 25 cycles of 94 8C/30 s, 37 8C/30 s
and 72 8C/30 s. This was followed by 72 8C 5 min
and finally a hold step at 20 8C.

Immediately before each test nucleic acid extracts were heated at 95 8C/5 min to denature
double stranded RNA and then placed in ice. Both
first and second round products were run on 2.5%
agarose gels in TAE buffer for 45 min at 5 V/cm.
The gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 mg/
ml) for 30 min and photographed using a Polaroid
land camera.
Mastermixes for first and second round nRTPCR were made up in 2000 test volume batches,
quality controlled, labelled with a unique identifier, aliquoted and stored at /70 8C. For use an
aliquot of mastermix was thawed and appropriate
volumes were dispensed into PCR tubes.

2.3. Validation of nmRT-PCR
The nmRT-PCR was validated using a panel of
known virus positive faecal specimens. This included 12 specimens positive for rotavirus by EM,
12 specimens positive for adenovirus by EM and
17 specimens positive for NLV by nRT-PCR. The
NLV positive specimens were representative of 7
different outbreaks from different years. Additionally 60 specimens were tested from children with
gastroenteritis which were negative by EM giving a
total of 101 validation specimens. In this validation process all specimens giving positive results

338

were retested. The specimens had been collected
over a 3 year period and stored at /20 8C.
2.4. Electron microscopy
Two millilitre volumes of 10% faecal specimens
were centrifuged at 40 000 rpm for 1 h and the
resulting pellet was resuspended in 25 ml distilled
water. The suspension was then adsorbed onto a
glow discharged formvar coated EM grid for a
minimum of 3 h and stained with 2% methylamine
tungstate for 10 s. The grid was viewed in a
Phillips CM 10 electron microscope at a magnification of 45 000 for approximately 10 min.
2.5. Test speciﬁcity
This was designed to assess test specificity and
as an indicator of possible cross contamination
and/or amplicon contamination in the routine use
of the assay. For this purpose all positive rotavirus
and group F adenovirus results in patients over 10
years old were regarded as false positive. The
standard
formula
(true
negatives)/(false
positives/true negatives) was applied.

3. Results
3.1. Validation of nmRT-PCR

are shown in Table 2. The known positive specimens for adenovirus, rotavirus and NLV were

mens were found positive for rotavirus which were
negative by EM. None of the known positive
specimens were positive for the other targets in the
assay. The nmRT-PCR assay gave the same results
as molecular tests for the individual targets.

3.2. Investigation of acute gastroenteritis by nmRTPCR
The results are tabulated by age in Table 3 and
by monthly incidence in Fig. 1. The total number
of patients investigated was 1945 and the total
number of positive specimens was 419 giving an
overall positive specimen rate of 21.54%.
Rotavirus infections were detected in 190 patients with an age range from 12 days to just under
8 years old. Rotavirus infections were detected in
137 patients less than 2 years old and there were 51
rotavirus infections in patients between 2 and 8
years old and in 2 cases their age was not given.
More than half of all rotavirus infections (97/190)
occurred in the 3 months March, April and May.

Fig. 1. The detection by nmRT-PCR of group F adenovirus, rotavirus and NLVsv in each month from September 2000 to August
2001.

September was the lowest month for rotavirus
infections.
Group F adenovirus infections were detected in
97 patients. Of these 95 were in the age range 15
days to just under 10 years old with one patient 75
years old and one whose age was not given. There
were 72 group F adenovirus infections in children
less than 2 years old and 23 infections in patients
between 2 and 10 years old. Marked seasonal
occurrences were apparent for rotavirus and NLV
but not for group F adenovirus which were
distributed more evenly throughout the year
(Fig. 1).
NLVs were detected in 132 patients. The highest
monthly incidence was January followed closely by
February. November was the lowest month but
NLV infections were detected in every month of
the year. These were spread across all age groups
from a child of 23 days to an adult of 89 years old
and 9 patients whose age was not given. There
were 41 infections in children less than 2 years old.
Between 2 and 7 years there were 14 NLV
infections and in the 7/10 age groups none were
detected. Further analysis of the patients over 10
years old (n /735) showed that there were 68
positive specimens from this age group. Fiftyseven positives were associated with 10 different
outbreaks involving 130 patients. The outbreaks
were mainly associated with the catering industry
and hospital ward outbreaks involving patients
and staff. This leaves 11 positives from 600 adult
specimens from sources not known to be associated with outbreaks.

Dual infections were detected in 4 patients. A
child of 8 months was infected with NLV and
group F adenovirus and another 8 month old child
was infected with rotavirus and group F adenovirus. There were two children, one of 21 months
and the other of 32 months who had dual
infections with rotavirus and NLV.
Family outbreaks were diagnosed on four occasions. There were 2 sets of female twins 6 and 13
months old and a set of male twins 6 weeks old
who were infected with rotavirus. The fourth
family was a father, mother and their one year
old daughter who were infected with NLV.
3.3. Test speciﬁcity
There were 735 specimens negative for rotavirus
in patients over 10 years of age. This was taken as
the number of true negatives. There were no
rotavirus infections in this age group. This yields
a specificity for rotavirus of 100%. For group F
adenovirus there were 734 true negatives with one
assumed false positive. This gives a calculated
specificity for group F adenovirus of 99.86%.

4. Discussion
The nmRT-PCR assay which we describe represents a further development in the application
of molecular assays to clinical services. The single
assay detects viruses from the three major groups
implicated in viral gastroenteritis in specimens
from both adults and children. The diagnosis of



340

H.J. O’Neill et al. / Journal of Clinical Virology 25 (2002) 335 /343

viral gastroenteritis can be carried out by various
non-molecular techniques such as EM, enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) and latex agglutination tests
(Bates et al., 1993; Curry et al., 1999; Grimwood et
al., 1995; Rybicka et al., 1996; Vipond et al., 2000).
Normally molecular detection requires the use of
three separate protocols to detect the three main
causes of viral gastroenteritis since adenoviruses,
rotaviruses and NLV viruses have different nucleic
acid types (Estes, 1996; Kapikian et al., 1996b;
Shenk, 1996). Special consideration has been made
in the protocol for the double stranded RNA
target of rotavirus. Prior to setting up the first
round assay a melting step at 95 8C/5 min
followed by immediately placing the specimens
on ice is included. This step in the protocol, while
facilitating the detection of rotavirus, does not
alter the ability of the technique to detect either the
DNA target of group F adenoviruses or the
ssRNA target of NLV. While it is clearly not
necessary to use RT-PCR for group F adenoviruses it was expeditious to include this virus
target in the assay. During the assay development
process it was shown that the sensitivity of group
F adenovirus detection was not impaired by its
inclusion in the nmRT-PCR assay.
The assay was validated using a selection of
virus positive clinical specimens collected over a 3
year period. These were selected at random to
represent the most common viruses in circulation
in the local community. The nmRT-PCR assay
was able to detect all of the selected validation
specimens and some additional specimens which
had previously been reported as EM negative.
Nevertheless as with any molecular based approach to virus detection one must be aware of
the emergence of variants which may arise over
time, particularly for NLV. Nine of the selected
primers have been published and validated previously but two additional primers for adenovirus
and one additional primer for rotavirus were
designed after carrying out sequence alignments
of each. Care was taken to select the primers from
conserved areas across the various genotypes of
each virus and to avoid variable or genotype
specific regions of the genomes. The primers used
were specific for the hexon gene of group F
adenoviruses, the VP7 gene of group A rotaviruses

and the polymerase gene of NLV. The combination of NLV primers were selected for their broad
range specificity and for their proven ability to
detect NLV in the investigation of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks in adults (O’Neill et al., 2001).
It has recently been shown that outbreaks and
sporadic cases of NLV gastroenteritis in Ireland
are currently caused by genogroup two viruses
clustered around the Bristol/Lordsdale clade and
that genogroup 1 viruses are found only occasionally in sporadic cases (Foley et al., 2001). We
recognise that the primers used for NLV have been
updated and refined in recent times but our
reporting algorithm addresses any shortfall in the
sensitivity of our assay for different genotypes of
NLV. For this reason outbreaks of gastroenteritis
which are epidemiologically consistent with NLV
infection and which are negative with nmRT-PCR
are sent to another laboratory for further testing
by EM and also by RT-PCR for Sapporo-like
viruses (SLV). To date we have not detected any
outbreaks by EM which were negative by nmRTPCR and also we have not detected any outbreaks
associated with SLV.
The final choice of the extraction method was
based on several considerations. The ability to
extract ssRNA, dsRNA and dsDNA with equal
efficiency from clinical specimens was paramount.
Others have investigated extraction protocols and
showed that different protocols had different
efficiencies depending on the specimen type and
the type of nucleic acid being preferentially
extracted (Rasool et al., 2002). However in the
clinical laboratory a single extraction protocol is
necessary. The QIAGEN method used here was
not only efficient but was convenient to use in
routine practice.
It is our policy to use nested PCR protocols in
our molecular diagnostic unit whenever possible
(Coyle et al., 2001; O’Neill et al., 2001; Ong et al.,
2001). Nested PCR adds increased sensitivity and
specificity to PCR protocols (Simmonds, 1995).
The main argument against nested protocols is
that they are subject to the possibility of carryover
or amplicon contamination. We have shown that
this possibility is considerably reduced by strictly
adhering to sterile technique and the performance
of the various procedures in designated areas



H.J. O’Neill et al. / Journal of Clinical Virology 25 (2002) 335 /343

(O’Neill et al., 2001). We use four designated areas
in four different laboratory rooms and operate a
strict one way system to reduce the possibility of
amplicon contamination. For this assay a test for
specificity was designed as a measure of possible
cross contamination or amplicon contamination in
the routine application of the assay to clinical
specimens. The specificity was 100% for rotavirus
and 99.86% for group F adenovirus. These results
are definitive evidence that contamination did not
occur during service delivery of the assay.
These two viruses are most likely to infect
patients under 10 years of age and are excreted
in high titres in faeces of infected individuals and
are therefore most likely to be involved in contamination incidents. If contamination had occurred there would have been a more random
distribution of positives across the age groups
compromising specificity as calculated. Additionally in non-outbreak specimens from adults there
was a low detection rate of NLV (11/600) compared to that in clearly defined outbreak specimens (57/130).
Rotaviruses, group F adenoviruses and NLV
are known as the main causative agents of gastroenteritis in children. However the importance of
NLV in children is often overlooked and/or under
reported when less sensitive or single target assays
are employed. An analysis of the data published by
McCaughey et al show that by EM, NLV was
detected in 0.7% of children, whereas in this study
6.79% of children from a similar population had
NLV gastroenteritis detected by nmRT-PCR
(McCaughey et al., 1998). Although the data being
compared are from different time periods the
difference in the figures strongly indicates under
reporting of NLV when less sensitive techniques
such as EM are being used. Other workers have
also reported an increased detection of gastroenteritis viruses in stool specimens when RT-PCR is
used (Bon et al., 1999; Pang et al., 2000). These
workers used a variety of single target techniques
including immunoassay and RT-PCR.
We did not find any rotavirus infections in
adults. Our assay was designed to detect group A
rotaviruses as they have been shown to be the most
prevalent in children and adults. Some workers
have reported a high proportion of group A

341

rotavirus infection in adults while others have
shown the presence of group C rotaviruses in adult
patients from various geographical locations (Nakajima et al., 2001; Nilsson et al., 2000; Oishi et al.,
1993; Refugio Gonzalez-Losa et al., 2001). The
oldest individual with rotavirus infection was less
than 8 years old and group F adenovirus infections
were detected mainly in children less than 6 years
old. It is known that after adenovirus and rotavirus infection in childhood immunity is conferred
which gives good protection against severe disease
upon re-infection (Glass et al., 2001). This accounts for the association of group F adenoviruses
and rotavirus with early childhood and the lack of
detection of these viruses in older age groups. In
contrast a single infection with NLV in childhood
does not confer lifelong immunity (Estes et al.,
2000; Kapikian et al., 1978). Immunity to NLV is
type specific or only acquired after a number of
exposures in adult years.
The finding of three family outbreaks caused by
rotavirus was interesting. In each family it was the
twins who were infected while other siblings in the
households were not infected. This is presumably
because the older siblings were immune after
previous exposure. The detection of 4 patients
less than 3 years of age with dual infections was
not unexpected. Dual infection has been noted
previously in various situations including viral
respiratory tract infections and viral gastroenteritis (Ong et al., 2001) (Giordano et al., 2001;
Madeley, 1994). However the pathogenesis or
significance of dual viral infections is not fully
understood. The presence of two viruses in
patients with gastroenteritis may be suggestive of
nosocomial infection as all 4 such patients in this
study were hospitalised and being nursed in wards
with other children with acute gastroenteritis of
different viral aetiologies. Alternatively their presence may simply reflect the viruses circulating in
the community at that time.
It is known that in hospitals after an outbreak of
NLV staff become more vigilant and send to the
laboratory more specimens for testing than is
otherwise necessary. This reaction to outbreaks is
demonstrated by the fact that when outbreaks are
first diagnosed there is a high proportion of

to 10 days this rate declines to zero (O’Neill et al.,
2001). This inappropriate overuse has major
resource implications for the virology laboratory.
We have open access to the use of the assay for the
investigation of specimens from children but we
have introduced a policy to restrict the use of the
assay for adults in hospitals and institutions to
tests ordered by microbiologists and/or consultants in communicable disease control after consultation with the laboratory staff. The assay
detailed here has proved an invaluable tool for
the investigation of acute gastroenteritis in specimens from patients of all ages. It could be argued
that it is unnecessary to test adults for rotavirus or
group F adenoviruses. However we have found it
convenient in the management of the laboratory to
use a multiplex mastermix with a standard protocol for gastroenteritis to test all specimens from
patients of all ages.
