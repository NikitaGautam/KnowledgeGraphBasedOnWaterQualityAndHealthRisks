Rainstorms increase levels of fecal indicator bacteria in urban coastal waters, but it is unknown whether exposure to seawater after rainstorms increases rates of acute illness. Our objective was to provide the ﬁrst estimates of
rates of acute illness after seawater exposure during both dry- and wet-weather periods and to determine the relationship between levels of indicator bacteria and illness among surfers, a population with a high potential for exposure after rain. We enrolled 654 surfers in San Diego, California, and followed them longitudinally during the
2013–2014 and 2014–2015 winters (33,377 days of observation, 10,081 surf sessions). We measured daily surf
activities and illness symptoms (gastrointestinal illness, sinus infections, ear infections, infected wounds). Compared with no exposure, exposure to seawater during dry weather increased incidence rates of all outcomes (e.g.,
for earache or infection, adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.86, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.27, 2.71; for infected wounds, IRR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.54, 5.98); exposure during wet weather further increased rates (e.g., for earache or infection, IRR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.95, 5.51; for infected wounds, IRR = 4.96, 95% CI: 2.18, 11.29). Fecal
indicator bacteria measured in seawater (Enterococcus species, fecal coliforms, total coliforms) were strongly
associated with incident illness only during wet weather. Urban coastal seawater exposure increases the incidence
rates of many acute illnesses among surfers, with higher incidence rates after rainstorms.

same studies, researchers found that levels of fecal indicator
bacteria in seawater were positively associated with incident
gastrointestinal illness if there was a well-deﬁned source of
human fecal contamination impacting the seawater (4–8).
Individual cases of acute infections and deaths associated with
waterborne pathogens have been reported among surfers in
southern California who surfed during or after rainstorms (9),
and 2 cross-sectional studies of surfers found that seawater exposure after heavy rainfall increased reported illness (10, 11).
To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies to
determine whether rainstorms increase illness among persons
who participate in ocean recreation and no studies that have
evaluated whether levels of fecal indicator bacteria are associated with incident illness during wet weather periods.

Freshwater runoff after rainstorms increases levels of fecal
indicator bacteria measured in seawater (1), but little is known
about whether persons who participate in ocean recreation
have a higher risk of acute illness after rainstorms. Absent epidemiologic studies to inform beach management guidelines
after rainstorms, California beach managers post advisories at
beaches that discourage contact with seawater for 72 hours
after rainfall—a practice that is based on fecal indicator bacteria proﬁles in storm water outﬂows, which typically decline to
prerainstorm levels within 3–5 days (2, 3).
In prospective cohorts in California, investigators have
found increased incidence of gastrointestinal illness and other
acute symptoms (e.g., eye and ear infections) associated with
seawater exposure during dry summer months (4–8). In the

limits—Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surﬁng Park. Both
monitored beaches have storm-impacted drainage, attract surfers year-round, and have water quality levels similar to those
of other beaches in the county (13). Ocean Beach is adjacent
to the San Diego river, which drains a 1,088-km2 varied landuse watershed with many ﬂow-control structures; Tourmaline
Surﬁng Park is adjacent to Tourmaline Creek and a storm
drain, which together drain an urban, largely impervious,
6-km2 watershed (Figure 1). The study’s technical report
includes additional details (14).

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study among surfers
in San Diego, California. We focused on surfers because
they are a well-deﬁned population that regularly enters the
ocean year-round, even during and immediately after rainstorms, given that surﬁng conditions often improve during
storms (12). Our objectives were to determine whether exposure to seawater increased rates of incident illness among
surfers compared with periods when they did not surf in
order to determine whether exposure during or immediately
after rainstorms increased rates more than did exposure during dry weather. We also sought to evaluate the relationship
between levels of fecal indicator bacteria in seawater and
incident illness rates during dry and wet weather.

Study design and enrollment

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of surfers recruited in San Diego over 2 winters, with enrollment and
follow-up periods chosen to capture most rainfall events in
the region. During the ﬁrst winter (open enrollment from
January 14, 2014, to March 18, 2014; end of follow-up on
June 4, 2014), we enrolled surfers through in-person interviews at the 2 monitored beaches and through targeted online
advertising on Surﬂine.com, a popular website on which surf
conditions are reported. We enrolled participants at monitored
beaches and online to assess whether individuals enrolled
through these 2 modes were similar in their exposures and
other characteristics. Participants enrolled on the beach were
very similar to those enrolled online (Table 1), so we exclusively enrolled participants through the study’s website during
the second winter (open enrollment from December 1, 2014,

METHODS
Setting

Southern California has one of the most urbanized coastlines in the world, and it receives nearly all of its annual rainfall during the winter months (November–April). San Diego
County beaches have some of the best water quality in California based on levels of fecal indicator bacteria, but water quality deteriorates after rainstorms (13). The most heavily used
beaches in the region are affected by urban runoff after storms,
and local beach managers post advisories that discourage
water contact within 72 hours of rainfall. In the present study,
we focused enrollment and conducted extensive water quality
measurement at 2 monitored beaches within San Diego city

during the study period, had a valid e-mail address or mobile
telephone number, and could access the internet with a computer or smartphone.
Participants completed a brief enrollment questionnaire,
and each Tuesday they received a text message or e-mail
reminder to complete a short weekly survey. Participants reported daily surf activity (location, date, and times of entry
and exit) and illness symptoms (details below) for the previous
7 days using the study’s web or smartphone (iOS or Android)
application. We used an open cohort design in which participants were allowed to enter and exit the cohort over the
follow-up period. We excluded follow-up time during which
participants reported surﬁng outside of southern California.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the University of California, Berkeley,
and all participants provided informed consent. Participants
received a modest incentive for participation ($20 gift certiﬁcate per 4 weekly surveys completed). Web Table 1 (available at https://academic.oup.com/aje) includes a Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
checklist.
Outcome deﬁnition and measurement

In weekly surveys, participants reported daily records of the
following symptoms: diarrhea (deﬁned as ≥3 loose/watery
stools in 24 hours), sinus pain or infection, earache or infection,
infection of an open wound, eye infection, skin rash, and fever.
During the second winter, we added sore throat, cough, and
runny nose. We created composite outcomes from the symptoms, including: gastrointestinal illness, which was deﬁned as
1) diarrhea, 2) vomiting, 3) nausea and stomach cramps, 4) nausea and missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal illness, or
5) stomach cramps and missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal illness (15); and upper respiratory illness, which was
deﬁned as any 2 of the following: 1) sore throat, 2) cough, 3)
runny nose, and 4) fever (16). We created a composite outcome
of “any infectious symptom” deﬁned as having any 1 of the
following: gastrointestinal illness, diarrhea, vomiting, eye
infection, infection of open wounds or fever. Our rationale
was that it would exclude outcomes that could potentially
have noninfectious causes (earache or infection, sinus pain
or infection, skin rash, upper respiratory illness) and would
capture a broad spectrum of sequelae associated with waterborne pathogens. We deﬁned incident episodes as the onset
of symptoms preceded by 6 or more symptom-free days to
increase the likelihood that separate episodes represented
distinct infections (17, 18).
Exposure deﬁnition and measurement

We classiﬁed the 3 days after each seawater exposure as
exposed periods and all other days of observation as unexposed periods. We deﬁned wet-weather exposure as exposure to seawater within 3 days of 0.25 cm or more of rainfall
in a 24-hour period, which is the rainfall criterion used by
San Diego County for posting wet-weather beach advisories;
we classiﬁed all other seawater exposure as dry-weather exposure. We used rainfall measurements from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Lindbergh Field

Station. Among surfers, most exposure took place during the
morning hours, so if a storm’s precipitation started after
12:00 PM, we did not classify that day as wet weather (only
the following day) to reduce exposure misclassiﬁcation.
Staff collected daily water samples from January 15, 2014, to
March 5, 2014, and from December 2, 2014, to March 31,
2015, at 6 sites across the 2 monitored beaches (Figure 1). Staff
collected 1-liter water samples in the morning (08:30 AM ±
2 hours) just below the water surface (0.5–1.0 meters) in sterilized, sample-rinsed bottles. We sampled discharges during
6 rainstorms immediately upstream from where Tourmaline
Creek and the San Diego River discharge to the sea (Figure 1).
We tested samples for culturable Enterococcus (US Environmental Protection Agency method 1600), fecal coliforms (standard method 9222D), and total coliforms (standard method
9222B). All laboratory analyses met quality-control objectives
for absence of background contamination (blanks) and precision (duplicates).
Statistical analysis

We prespeciﬁed all analyses (19). Web Appendices 1 and 2
contain statistical details and sample size calculations. In the
seawater exposure analysis, we calculated incidence rates by
dividing incident episodes by person-days in unexposed and
exposed periods during follow-up. If participants missed
weekly surveys during follow-up, we did not include those
periods in the analysis. We measured the association between
seawater exposure and subsequent illness using an incidence
rate ratio, which we estimated using a log-linear rate model
with robust standard errors to account for repeated observations within individuals (20, 21). To examine illness rates separately for dry- and wet-weather exposures, we created a 3level categorical exposure that classiﬁed each participant’s
follow-up time into unexposed, dry-weather exposure, and
wet-weather exposure periods. We calculated a log-linear test
of trend in the incidence rate ratios for dry- and wet-weather
exposures (22).
In the fecal indicator association analysis, we estimated the
association between levels of fecal indicator bacteria and illness
using the subset of surf sessions matched to water-quality indicator measurements at the monitored beaches. We matched
daily geometric mean indicator levels to surfers by beach and
date (weighted by time in water if recent exposure included
multiple days).We modeled the relationship between indicator
levels and illness using a log-linear model and estimated the
incidence rate ratio associated with a 1−log10 increase in indicator level. We also estimated the incidence rate ratio associated
with exposures to water above versus below US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory guidelines (geometric
mean Enterococcus >35 colony-forming units per 100 mL)
(23) or, in a second deﬁnition, if any single sample on the
exposure day exceeded 104 colony-forming units per 100 mL.
We hypothesized that the relationship between fecal indicator
bacteria and illness could be modiﬁed by dry- or wet-weather
exposure and allowed the exposure-response relationship to
vary during dry and wet weather by including an indicator for
wet-weather periods and a term for the interaction between
indicator bacteria levels and the indicator of wet weather. We
controlled for potential confounding (24) from demographic,

RESULTS
Study population

We enrolled 654 individuals who contributed on average 51 days of follow-up (range, 6–139 days). The study
population’s median age was 34 years (interquartile range,
27–45), and the majority of participants were male (73%),
college-educated (63%), and employed (75%) (Table 1).
Follow-up included 33,377 person-days of observation
after excluding time spent outside of southern California
(623 person-days). We excluded from adjusted analyses
47 individuals (1,599 person-days of observation) who
provided outcome and exposure information but failed to
complete a background questionnaire and thus had missing covariate information.
Water quality and surfer exposure

There were 10 rainstorms with 0.25 cm or more of rain
during the study. Field staff collected 1,073 beach water
samples and 92 wet-weather discharge samples for fecal
indicator bacteria analysis. Median Enterococcus levels
were higher during wet weather than during dry weather
(Figure 2). During follow-up, surfers entered the ocean
twice per week on average and experienced 10,081 total
days of seawater exposure, including 1,327 days of wetweather exposure. Surfers were less likely to enter the
ocean during or within 1 day of rain. The median ocean
entry time was 08:00 AM (interquartile range, 06:45–10:30
AM ), and the median time spent in the water was 2 hours
(interquartile range, 1–2 hours) (Web Figure 1). Of the 10,081
exposure days, surfers reported wearing a wetsuit during 95%,
immersing their head during 96%, and swallowing water during
38%. The most frequented surf locations were the 2 monitored
beaches: Tourmaline Surﬁng Park (25% of surf days) and Ocean
Beach (16% of surf days), which reﬂected targeted enrollment at
those beaches (Web Figure 2). There were 5,819 days of observation matched to water-quality measurements at monitored
beaches, including 1,358 days during wet weather.
Illness associated with seawater exposure

Seawater exposure in the past 3 days was associated with
increased incidence rates of all outcomes except for upper
respiratory illness (Web Table 2). Unadjusted and adjusted
incidence rate ratio estimates were similar, and for most outcomes, adjusted incidence rate ratios were slightly attenuated
toward the null (Web Table 2). With the exception of fever
and skin rash, incidence rates increased from unexposed
to dry-weather exposure to wet-weather exposure periods
(Table 2), a pattern also present on the risk scale (Web
Figure 3). Compared with unexposed periods, wet-weather
exposure led to the largest relative increase in earaches/infec-

Illness associated with fecal indicator bacteria levels

Enterococcus, total coliform, and fecal coliform levels were
positively associated with increased incidence of almost all outcomes during the study (Web Table 3). Rainfall was a strong
effect modiﬁer of the association (Table 4). During dry weather,
there was no association between Enterococcus levels and illness except for infected wounds, but Enterococcus was strongly
associated with illness after wet-weather exposure (e.g., for
each log10 increase, gastrointestinal illness IRR = 2.17, 95%
CI: 1.16, 4.03; Table 4, Web Figure 5, and Web Table 4). Associations were attenuated in adjusted analyses, but relationships
were similar (e.g., for gastrointestinal illness, wet-weather
IRR = 1.75, 95% CI: 0.80, 3.84; Table 4). There was evidence
for excess risk of gastrointestinal illness at higher Enterococcus
levels only during wet-weather periods (Web Figure 6): The
predicted excess risk that corresponded to the current US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory guideline of 35
colony-forming units per 100 mL was 16 episodes per 1,000
(95% CI: 5, 27). Negative control analyses showed no consistent association between fecal indicator bacteria and illness
among participants during periods in which they had no recent
seawater contact (Web Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Key results

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst prospective cohort study
in which the association between incident illness and exposure to seawater in wet weather has been measured, and the
ﬁndings represent novel empirical measures of incident illness associated with storm water discharges. There was a
consistent increase in acute illness incidence rates between
unexposed, dry-weather, and wet-weather exposure periods
(Tables 2 and 3). Rainstorms led to higher levels of fecal
indicator bacteria (Figure 2), and a sensitivity analysis illustrated that a 2–3 day window after rainstorms captured the
majority of excess incidence associated with wet-weather exAm J Epidemiol. 2017;186(7):866–875

posure (Web Figure 4). Fecal indicator bacteria matched to
individual surf sessions were strongly associated with illness
only during wet weather periods (Table 4, Web Figure 5).
Interpretation

Swimmers are more rare during the winter months, and surfers’ frequent and intense exposure made them an ideal population in which to study the relationship between illness and
exposure to seawater in wet weather (27). The associations
estimated in this study may not reﬂect those of the general
population, but among a highly exposed subgroup of athletes,
our results measure the illness associated with seawater exposure after rainstorms in southern California. Enrolling surfers
led to some important differences between the present study
population and most swimmer cohorts. We enrolled adults
because we could not guarantee adequate consent for minors
through online enrollment, whereas swimmer cohorts have
historically enrolled predominantly families with children
(28); children are more susceptible and have greater risk
than do adult swimmers (15). Participants surfed twice per week
for 2 hours each session, with nearly universal head immersion
(96% of exposures) and frequent water ingestion (38% of exposures). This far exceeds exposure levels recorded in swimmer
cohorts. Likely because of surfers’ repeated exposures to pathogens in seawater, studies have found higher levels of immunity
to hepatitis A and more frequent gut colonization by antibioticresistant Escherichia coli among surfers than among the general
population (29, 30).
Despite surfers’ intense and frequent exposures, gastrointestinal illness rates observed in the present study were similar to those measured among beachgoers California cohorts
in the summer (Web Appendix 6, Web Figure 7), and the
increase in gastrointestinal illness rates associated with seawater exposure (adjusted IRR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.78;
Web Table 2) was similar to estimates measured in marine
swimmer cohorts in California and elsewhere in the United
States (15, 31). However, the 3-fold increase in rates of

Abbreviations: CI, conﬁdence interval; IRR, incidence rate ratio.
Unadjusted and adjusted incidence rate ratios compare incidence rates in the 3 days after seawater exposure during dry or wet weather with
incidence rates during unexposed periods. Table 2 includes the underlying data. Tests of trend in the IRR between exposure categories are signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) if the conﬁdence interval for wet-weather exposure excludes 1.0 (22).
b
We controlled for the following time-invariant potential confounders: age, sex, educational level, employment status, household income, years
the individual had surfed, reported behavior of typically avoiding the ocean after wet weather, surfboard length, mode of enrollment (beach vs. Internet). We controlled for chronic health conditions only for the corresponding outcomes: ear problems, sinus problems, gastrointestinal conditions,
respiratory conditions, skin conditions. We also controlled for the following time-varying potential confounders: entered the ocean for an activity
other than surﬁng, any illness symptoms in the week preceding the risk window, day of recall, day of the week, and rainfall total during the past 3
days.
c
Deﬁned as entering the sea within 3 days of 0.25 cm or more of rain in 24 hours.
d
Only measured in year 2 of the study.
e
Includes gastrointestinal illness, eye infections, infected wounds, and fever.
a

earache/infection and 5-fold increase in infected open
wounds associated with exposure after rainstorms (Table 3)
are stronger associations than have been reported in previous
studies, and they provide evidence for increased incidence of
a broad set of infectious symptoms after seawater exposure
within 3 days of rain.
Fecal indicator bacteria were a reliable marker of human
illness risk in this setting only within 3 days of rainfall
(Table 4). Our results are consistent with summer studies in
California in which investigators found associations between
Enterococcus levels and illness only if there was a well-deﬁned
source of human fecal contamination (4–8). Our ﬁndings are
also consistent with model predictions of higher gastrointestinal
illness risk among southern California surfers after storms (32).
Molecular testing for pathogens in storm water discharge to
study monitored beaches identiﬁed near-ubiquitous presence of
norovirus and Campylobacter species, and models parameterized with pathogen measurements predicted higher illness risk after rainstorms (14). The association between
fecal indicator bacteria measured during wet weather and a
range of nonenteric illnesses, such as sinus pain or infection
and fever (Table 4), suggests that fecal indicator bacteria may
mark broader bacterial or viral pathogen contamination in seawater after rainstorms.
Some study outcomes could have noninfectious causes
associated with surﬁng. Earache and sinus pain can result

from physical incursion of saltwater through surﬁng’s highintensity exposure, ingestion of saltwater can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, and wetsuit use could cause skin rashes.
If the association between surf exposure and symptoms resulted from noninfectious causes, we would expect similar
incidence rates after wet- and dry-weather exposures. This
was observed for skin rash, but incidence rates for sinus, ear,
and gastrointestinal illnesses were higher after wet-weather
exposure (Table 2), and the strong association between fecal
indicator bacteria and fever during wet-weather conditions
was consistent with an infectious etiology (Table 4).
It is also possible that some infections acquired during surfing could result from nonanthropogenic sources. The ocean
was warmer than usual during the second winter because of a
weak El Niño, which caused conditions favorable to naturally
occurring Vibrio parahaemolyticus and toxin-producing
marine algae that can cause human illness (33). Wound infection was the single outcome strongly associated with fecal
indicator bacteria measured during dry weather (Table 4), an
observation consistent with a pathogen source like V. parahaemolyticus that covaries with fecal indicator bacteria even in
nonstorm conditions. Yet, the consistently higher rates of infected wounds and other symptoms after wet-weather exposure
compared with dry-weather exposure (Tables 2 and 3) suggests
that storm water runoff impacted by anthropogenic sources
constitutes an important pathogen source in this setting.

Surfer Illness After Seawater Exposure 873

Earache or infection



874

Arnold et al.

Limitations

The use of self-reported symptoms could bias the association between seawater exposure and illness away from the
null if surfers overreported illness after exposure; conversely, random (nondifferential) errors in exposures or outcomes could bias associations toward the null (34). The
survey measured daily exposure and outcomes in separate
modules—an intentional decision to separate the measurements and inhibit systematic reporting bias. Adjusted analyses controlled for day of recall and day of the week to reduce
nondifferential bias from recall errors but would not control
for systematic bias. Negative control exposure analyses found
no association between Enterococcus levels and illness on
days with no recent water exposure (Web Table 5), which
suggests that unmeasured confounding or reporting bias is
unlikely to explain the association between Enterococcus
levels and illness. Moreover, the use of daily average levels
of fecal indicator bacteria could bias the association between
water quality and illness toward the null if the averaging resulted
in nondifferential misclassiﬁcation error (35).
We measured incident outcomes within 3 days of seawater
exposure because the population regularly entered the ocean,
a 3-day period captures the incubation period for the most
common waterborne pathogens (e.g., norovirus, Campylobacter species, Salmonella species) (36), and past studies
found that most excess episodes of gastrointestinal illness
associated with seawater exposure occurred in the ﬁrst 1–2
days (15). Illness caused by waterborne pathogens with longer incubation periods (e.g., Cryptosporidium species) (37)
could have been misclassiﬁed in this study, which could bias
results toward the null by artiﬁcially increasing incidence
rates in unexposed periods and decreasing rates in exposed
periods.
Conclusions

Surﬁng was associated with increased incidence of several
categories of symptoms, and associations were stronger if
surﬁng took place shortly after rainstorms. Higher levels of
fecal indicator bacteria were strongly associated with fever,
sinus pain/infection, wound infection, and gastrointestinal
symptoms within 3 days of rainstorms. The internal consistency between water-quality measurements, patterns of illness after dry- and wet-weather exposures, and incidence
proﬁles with time since rainstorms lead us to conclude that
seawater exposure during or close to rainstorms at beaches
impacted by urban runoff in southern California increases
the incidence rates of a broad set of acute illnesses among
surfers. These ﬁndings provide strong evidence to support
the posting of beach warnings after rainstorms and initiatives
that would reduce pathogen sources in urban runoff that
ﬂows to coastal waters.
