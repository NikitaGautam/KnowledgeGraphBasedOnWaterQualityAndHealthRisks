Demands on global water supplies are increasing in response to the need to provide more food, water, and energy
for a rapidly growing population. These water stressors are exacerbated by climate change, as well as the growth
and urbanisation of industry and commerce. Consequently, urban water authorities around the globe are exploring alternative water sources to meet ever-increasing demands. These alternative sources are primarily treated
sewage, stormwater, and groundwater. Stormwater including roof-harvested rainwater has been considered as
an alternative water source for both potable and non-potable uses. One of the most signiﬁcant issues concerning
alternative water reuse is the public health risk associated with chemical and microbial contaminants. Several
studies to date have quantiﬁed fecal indicators and pathogens in stormwater. Microbial source tracking (MST)
approaches have also been used to determine the sources of fecal contamination in stormwater and receiving waters. This review paper summarizes occurrence and concentrations of fecal indicators, pathogens, and MST
marker genes in urban stormwater. A section of the review highlights the removal of fecal indicators and pathogens through water sensitive urban design (WSUD) or Best Management Practices (BMPs). We also discuss approaches for assessing and mitigating health risks associated with stormwater, including a summary of existing
quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models for potable and non-potable reuse of stormwater. Finally,
the most critical research gaps are identiﬁed for formulating risk management strategies.

1. Introduction
Water authorities worldwide are exploring alternative water
sources to meet ever-increasing demands for potable and non-potable
water due to the adverse impacts of climate change on water supplies.
Stormwater has been considered as an alternative water source for
both potable (drinking) and non-potable uses (gardening, landscaping,
and irrigation) (McArdle et al., 2011; Page et al., 2014c; Page et al.,
2015). There are several advantages to using stormwater, including
(i) reducing demands on the urban potable water supply (ii) diversiﬁcation of water supplies (iii) reducing discharge of untreated urban
stormwater to urban streams and marine outfalls. Despite these advantages, stormwater has not been widely adopted as an alternative water
due to a perceived lack of information on the presence and risk from microbial and chemical contaminants.
The chemical quality of stormwater has been reviewed and indicated the presence of numerous contaminants including heavy metals,
polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatics, halogenated ethers, monocyclic aromatics, phenols
and cresols, phthalate esters, nitrosamines, pesticides, and other organics, especially in urban and/or industrialized areas (Makepeace
et al., 1995; Eriksson et al., 2005; Baun et al., 2006; Huber et al., 2016).
Risk assessments of chemical contaminants in stormwater have suggested that in some cases, contaminants may exceed concentrations in
the environment that are relevant for ecological endpoints, but may
be lesser contributors to human health risks (Eriksson et al., 2005;
Baun et al., 2006; Eriksson et al., 2007). Non-carcinogenic risks due to
ingestion of ﬁsh in stormwater-contaminated waterbodies have been
identiﬁed as a potential concern (Bickford et al., 1999). Iron levels exceeding Australian guidelines and elevated (but below guideline) levels
of Arsenic have also been identiﬁed as potential risks for managed aquifer recharge with stormwater, with overall chemical risks from various
compounds posited to be low (Page et al., 2010a, 2010b). Heavy metals
and pathogens are thought to be the drivers of human health risks for
exposure to stormwater (Page et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2010d;
Chong et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2016). Indeed, public perception of microbial risks, in particular, remains a crucial barrier to the expansion of
water recycling and reuse (Higgins et al., 2002). Therefore, the current
review will focus on microbiological contaminants in stormwater and
their associated risks.
Pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa can be found in
stormwater runoff and subsequently transported to environmental
water bodies through sewer overﬂows, defective septic systems, agricultural runoff, defecation from wild animals and discharge of treated
sewage (Ahmed et al., 2005; Noble et al., 2006; Rajal et al., 2007). The
pathogens present in various animal fecal sources will differ from
those in sewage (Schoen and Ashbolt, 2010; Soller et al., 2015;
Federigi et al., 2019), and therefore stormwater is likely to contain a different pathogen proﬁle than sewage. Studies have reported a high prevalence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and enteric pathogens in
stormwater (Noble et al., 2006; Rajal et al., 2007; AWQC, 2008; Sidhu

et al., 2012a; Cizek et al., 2008). The microbial quality of water is
assessed by FIB such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus spp.
(USEPA, 2000). These indicators are abundant in the intestine of
warm-blooded animals, and their presence in waters indicates fecal
contamination and the likely presence of potential pathogens.
One major limitation of FIB is their poor correlation with the presence of pathogens, especially protozoans and enteric viruses (Hörman
et al., 2004; Selvakumar and Borst, 2006; McQuaig et al., 2009). Another
limitation of FIB is that they cannot provide information regarding the
sources of fecal contamination (Field and Samadpour, 2007; Stoeckel
and Harwood, 2007). Remediation strategies can be more effectively
implemented if the potential sources of fecal contamination and pathogens are known in stormwater (Sidhu et al., 2012b). Since the monitoring of FIB in water does not provide information on origin, e.g., human
or animal feces, researchers have developed a set of analytical tools collectively known as “microbial source tracking (MST) tools.” These tools
can be used to obtain information on whether the fecal contamination
in water came from human or animal wastewater or both (Harwood
et al., 2014).
Epidemiological studies indicated that the risks of gastrointestinal
illness (GI) among swimmers can be high when the water is contaminated with untreated sewage, as presumably indicated by the presence
of elevated levels of FIB (Cabelli et al., 1982; Wade et al., 2006; Marion
et al., 2010). However, mixed sources of fecal contamination (human
and animal feces) are often expected to be found in stormwater. Epidemiological data are lacking regarding the human health impacts from
mixed source of fecal contamination, which may pose different human
health risks.
Several studies in the research literature have provided quantitative
data on potential pathogens in roof-harvested rainwater stored in
tanks (Ahmed et al., 2008a; Ahmed et al., 2014a; Dobrowsky et al.,
2014). However, pathogen abundance data in stormwater runoff and
outfalls are still scarce. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize the concentrations of traditional and alternative fecal indicators, MST marker genes and potential pathogens in stormwater
runoff and outfalls. A section of this review has been dedicated to summarizing available quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs)
for potable and non-potable uses of stormwater. The focus for
reviewing available QMRA models is to summarize the types of assumptions used to model pathogen fate, transport, and exposure in
order to identify data gaps and areas where further attention is warranted. Additionally, a review of fecal indicators and pathogen log removal values (LRVs) through Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)
or Best Management Practices (BMPs) of stormwater runoff has been
compiled. Finally, risk mitigation approaches and the most critical research gaps are identiﬁed concerning the public health aspects of
stormwater reuse.
Peer-reviewed journal articles, reports, conference proceedings, and
guidelines published from 2005 to 2018 were taken into consideration.
Electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of
Knowledge were used to obtain the information. The literature search

was performed using the keywords “(stormwater OR sensitive urban
design OR WSUD OR green infrastructure OR low impact development
OR Low impact urban design and development) AND (pathogen OR
microb- OR bacter- OR protozoa OR source tracking OR MST OR fecal indicator OR fecal contamination OR health risk OR QMRA) and included
studies that are reported in English.
2. Fecal indicators
Routine monitoring of stormwater quality focuses on quantiﬁcation
of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. High concentrations (N4 log10 CFU/
100 mL) of FIB are generally found in stormwater runoff and receiving
waters (Jiang et al., 2015). Most of the stormwater or outfall samples
often exceed the sample threshold value of FIB for the designated recreational use of waters by one or more orders of magnitude. For example,
if we consider the 95th percentile value for Enterococcus spp./100 mL
water, many stormwater samples will exceed the threshold value classiﬁed as Class D (i.e., N 501 CFU/100 mL) by the National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guidelines for Recreational Use of
Water (NHMRC, 2008). The NHMRC used information from WHO
(2003) and Kay et al. (2004) to estimate that in Class D there would
be greater than a 10% chance of illness per single exposure.
Storm events have the potential to resuspend sediment-bound FIB
and pathogens back into water column resulting in elevated contamination levels (An et al., 2002; Cizek et al., 2008; Krometis et al., 2010; Sidhu
et al., 2012a). The elevated FIB concentrations generally occur at or just
before the peak inﬂow of the storm hydrograph. Stumpf et al. (2010)
determined the loading of FIB over dry and wet weather conditions in
tidal creeks in North Carolina, USA. The authors reported 30 and 37
times greater loadings of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in storm ﬂow compared to base ﬂow. E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were weakly correlated
(r2 = 0.13 to 0.32) with total suspended solids, while strong associations (r2 = 0.40 to 0.78) were observed between FIB and streamﬂow
rate and various stages (base, rising, peak and falling) of the
hydrograph. The authors also noted a large intra-storm variability in
FIB concentrations and recommended intensive sampling throughout
a storm in order to accurately quantify FIB rather than collecting a single
grab sample.
Rural or high density residential areas are reported to contribute
30–50 times greater E. coli levels in stormwater compared to light or
sparsely populated residential area (McCarthy et al., 2006). PauleMercado et al. (2016) investigated the variability of FIB concentrations
in agricultural, mixed land use and urban catchments with variable
catchment area, land use, and land cover. The urban site had the greatest
level (E. coli 7.39 log10 MPN/100 mL; fecal streptococci 7.21 log10 CFU/
100 mL) of FIB concentrations compared to agricultural site (E. coli
2.51 log10 MPN/100 mL; fecal streptococci 2.48 log10 CFU/100 mL) because of runoff from commercial markets and impervious cover, sewer
and septic overﬂows. The authors noted intra-event variability of FIB
across the monitoring sites. FIB concentrations increased during the
peak ﬂow and then decreased as the storm progressed. Levels of FIB signiﬁcantly (p b 0.05) varied between early and late summer seasons with
higher FIB concentrations observed in early summer. Anthropogenic activities and impervious cover were found to inﬂuence positive correlations (r N 0.6) between FIB numbers and environmental parameters
such as temperature, turbidity, and total suspended solids.
Although, FIB monitoring in stormwater is a common practice, there
are uncertainties associated with stormwater ﬂow and E. coli (McCarthy
et al., 2008; Harmel et al., 2006). Uncertainties of discrete E. coli samples
and ﬂow measurements were N30 and 97%, respectively. E. coli event
mean concentration uncertainties varied between 10 and 52% and that
uncertainties relating to site mean concentrations ranged from 35 to
55% (McCarthy et al., 2008). Sample collection procedures (5–30%), laboratory analysis, preservation/storage, and ﬂow also contributed substantial (14–28%) uncertainties (Harmel et al., 2006; Harmel et al.,
2010, 2016).

Another limitation of FIB is that they do not often correlate well with
the presence of pathogens in environmental waters. The appropriateness of using FIB to indicate the presence of pathogens especially viruses
and protozoa in stormwater has been questioned (Jiang et al., 2001;
Schroeder et al., 2002; Jiang, 2004; Robertson and Nicholson, 2005;
Signor et al., 2005; AWQC, 2008). This is somewhat expected as FIB in
stormwater are sourced from feces of both human and animals, while
human pathogens especially enteric viruses in urban stormwater
mainly derived from sewage. In addition, the decay rates of FIB may
be signiﬁcantly different than those of viruses (Ahmed et al., 2014b).
Hence, monitoring of FIB and interpreting their concentrations in
terms of human health risks may not yield any meaningful outcomes.
As a result of these limitations, FIB are generally not used directly for
risk estimation. However, some E. coli strains such as enteropathogenic
E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (E. coli O157:H7 or other EHEC),
enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and others are pathogenic to humans and
can be used for risk estimation purposes. Although these subsets are not
routinely measured, general FIB can be used as a preliminary screening
tool prior to testing for other pathogens. Additionally, ratios of FIB to
pathogens are used occasionally for risk assessment purposes
(Petterson et al., 2016).
3. MST marker genes in stormwater
Fecal contamination in stormwater can originate from point and
non-point sources. Human health risk will be different depending on
the sources. Untreated sewage poses the greatest risks to humans and
the environment due to high concentrations of enteric viruses (EC,
2000; Fong et al., 2010; Soller et al., 2010). Sewage may be introduced
into stormwater through illicit connections, cross connection between
sewer pipes, storm drains and leakages into sewers through broken
lines or poor pipe joints (Pitt, 2004). The presence of sewage in
stormwater can be problematic due to the likely co-presence of pathogens. Identifying the presence of sewage in stormwater using is not
straightforward due to dilution, inﬁltration, and lack of sensitive detection methods (Panasiuk et al., 2015). However, microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes are used to identify human feces and other
sources of animal fecal contamination such as cattle, dogs, pigs, and
birds in water (Harwood et al., 2014; Ahmed et al., 2016).
Human feces-associated marker genes such as Bacteroides HF183
(HF183), crAssphage CPQ_056 and CPQ_064, pepper mild mottle viruses (PMMoV), human polyomaviruses (HPyV), and Lachno3 are currently being used to determine the presence of human fecal
contamination in environmental waters by research laboratories and
water quality managers. These marker genes are sensitive and accurate
analytical approaches of human fecal contamination due to high hostspeciﬁcity and abundance in human and animal feces (Boehm et al.,
2013). Several studies have reported the presence of human fecesassociated marker genes in stormwater runoff and outfall samples
(Table 1). Sidhu et al. (2012a) reported the presence of the Bacteroides
HF183 (16 of 21 samples were positive for HF183 during both dry and
wet weather samples) and Enterococcus faecium enterococci surface
protein (esp) marker gene (8 of 23 samples were positive for esp during
both dry and wet weather samples) in stormwater run-off samples and
suggested the ubiquitous presence of sewage in the urban environment.
MST ﬁeld studies have identiﬁed aging infrastructure as a contributor to sewage intrusion into stormwater system (Marsalek and
Rochfort, 2004; Sauer et al., 2011; Guérineau et al., 2014). Several studies have reported the greater concentrations of the HF183 marker gene
in stormwater samples (Sercu et al., 2011; Van De Werfhorst et al.,
2014; Paar 3rd et al., 2015) (Table 1). Olds et al. (2018) observed high
levels of human Bacteroides (HB) and Lachno2 in the Milwaukee estuary
and at the lower reaches of the three major rivers forming the estuary in
Milwaukee, WI, USA after storm events. Concentrations of these marker
genes were one to three orders of magnitude higher (4.04–5.59 log10
GC/L of HB and 4.04–6.27 log10 GC/100 mL of Lachno2) in stormwater

samples during storm events compared to low ﬂow periods (3.53 log10
GC/100 mL of HB and 3.71 log10 GC/100 mL of Lachno2). A further increase in the order of a magnitude of marker genes was observed during
the combined sewer overﬂow (CSO) event compared to storm events.
The marker gene contamination level was high enough to exceed acceptable GI risk benchmark of 32 to 36 per 1000 primary contact
recreators in rivers or swimming at nearby beaches (USEPA, 2012a).
Staley et al. (2016) quantiﬁed Bacteroides HF183 in storm water outfalls and several sites along the Humber River in Toronto, Canada. HF183
was detected at all sites, with greater concentrations in outfall samples
(mean outfall concentrations of 6.22 log10 GC/L). Their results indicated
ubiquitous sewage contamination at storm water outfalls and throughout the Humber River. Steele et al. (2018) used digital PCR to quantify

1307

the HF183 marker gene in samples collected from multiple storm events
from San Diego River (n = 23) and Tourmaline Creek (n = 21) that discharge to popular surf beaches in San Diego, CA, USA. The authors noted
6.45–6.95 log10 GC HF183/L in stormwater discharges from Tourmaline
Creek and 5.30–6.24 log10 GC/100 mL in stormwater discharges from
the San Diego River. The HF183 marker was consistently detected
with human pathogen NoV (96% positive agreement in San Diego
River and 72% positive agreement in Tourmaline Creek).
Ahmed et al., 2018c examined the extent of sewage contamination
in an urban recreational lake located in Sydney, Australia that receives
wet weather overﬂows using two human feces-associated crAssphage
marker genes (CPQ_056 and CPQ_064). The concentrations of both
markers were higher (CPQ_056 ranging from 3.40 to 7.62 log10 GC/L

and CPQ_064 ranging from 2.90 to 6.95 log10 GC/L) in 20 of 20 (for
CPQ_056) and 18 of 20 (for CPQ_064) samples collected after storm
events compared to a dry weather event (10 of 10 samples were qPCR
negative for the CPQ_056 and 8 of 10 were negative for the CPQ_064
marker genes) suggesting that sewage contamination was transported
by urban stormwater runoff to the studied lake.
In addition to human-feces associated bacterial markers, viruses
such as HAdV species A-F and HPyV (urine indicator) have been used
to detect human fecal contamination in stormwater runoff (Brownell
et al., 2007; Ahmed et al., 2012; Sidhu et al., 2013). However, none of
these studies provided the concentrations of these viruses in
stormwater samples. Quantifying viral markers in stormwater samples
can be difﬁcult due to factors such as their low numbers in sewage, dilution and loss due to recovery and DNA extraction (Horswell et al.,
2010; Wong et al., 2012).
Compared to human feces-associated markers, less information is
available on the prevalence and concentrations of animal fecesassociated marker genes. Staley et al. (2016) determined the concentrations of seagull-associated Gull4 marker gene in a river and stormwater
outfall samples in Ontario, Canada. River sites were frequently (5 of 7
sites where gull fecal contamination was detected) impacted by gull
fecal contamination. Two of ﬁve storm outfalls were also positive for
gull feces. Bambic et al. (2015) reported the moderate occurrence of cattle and dog markers in stormwater samples ranging from 4.67 and 4.75
log10 GC/L. Storm events led to an increase (4.67 and 4.75 log10 GC/L) in
cattle and dog feces-associated Bacteroides marker genes compared to
dry events (3.23 and 3.20 log10 GC/L).
Corsi et al. (2014) tested 63 samples over a 17-month period across
the three sampling locations in Milwaukee River, WI, USA for human
and bovine viruses. Twenty samples were collected during low-ﬂow periods and 43 were collected during rainfall or snowmelt runoff periods.
Three of the seven bovine viruses analyzed were detected during the
study period. Bovine polyomavirus was present most often (32%)
followed by bovine rotavirus group A (19%), and bovine viral diarrhea
virus type 1 (5%). Bovine viruses were present in 46% of runoff samples
resulting from precipitation and snowmelt and 14% of low-ﬂow samples. Maximum concentrations for these three viruses ranged from 6.7
to 11 GC/L. Bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2, coronavirus, enterovirus,
and adenovirus were not detected. The results suggested the presence
of bovine fecal contamination in stormwater runoff. This is particularly
important because a recent study reported the high risks of gastrointestinal illness from cattle feces contaminated water due to protozoan
pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. (Soller et al., 2010).
Fecal contamination in stormwater originate from point and nonpoint sources, and this is supported by the fact that a number of
stormwater outfall samples had high FIB with low or no human
Bacteroides, suggesting that FIB may have originated from non-human
sources (Sauer et al., 2011). Therefore, markers targeting different animal species of zoonotic pathogen potential need to be employed to obtain more information on the magnitude of animal fecal contamination
in addition to sewage contamination.
Most of the stormwater studies provided MST results in the presence/absence form. The presence/absence results of any given marker
in a sample should be interpreted with care. Mere presence of a marker
does not represent any risk as the marker concentrations are generally
greater in sewage or animal feces compared to pathogens. In contrast,
lack of detection of a marker does not necessarily indicate the sample
is free from other contaminants and safe for human exposure. Multiple
lines of evidence (i.e., a toolbox approach) are required before
implementing remediation or assessing human health risk (Ahmed
et al., 2012; Mauffret et al., 2012).
4. Pathogens in stormwater
Increased urbanisation will increase the dissemination of waterborne pathogens in the environments (Hofstra, 2011). Information on

the concentrations of pathogens in stormwater is needed for risk assessment and management for beneﬁcial reuse. However, the data on the
occurrence and levels of pathogens in stormwater runoff is limited.
This is because collecting stormwater samples during storm events
can be challenging. Grab samples are easy to collect, and the cost associated with sampling is low, but only represent a snapshot of the
water quality at the time of collection (Harmel et al., 2010). Automated
samples are more accurate and appropriate for stormwater sampling as
they collect representative samples. However, it has to be installed at a
speciﬁc location, requiring construction of infrastructure and regular
maintenance. Other factors such as the presence of high concentrations
of suspended solids, grease and PCR inhibitors make it difﬁcult to detect
pathogens with molecular based methods (USEPA, 1999; Stenstrom
et al., 1984; Rajal et al., 2007).
Table 2 shows the occurrence and concentrations (where available)
of bacterial, protozoa, and viral pathogens in stormwater. Sidhu et al.
(2012a) investigated the presence of human pathogens in the urban
stormwater runoff in Australia. HAdV was frequently detected from all
sampling sites during wet weather conditions suggesting their widespread presence. Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Salmonella enterica were also detected during wet weather conditions.
Based on the results, the authors suggested that some degree of treatment of captured stormwater would be required if it were to be used
for non-potable purposes. However, the authors did not mention LRVs
that would be required for the safe use of stormwater.
Corsi et al. (2014) studied the prevalence, as well as hydrological and
seasonal variations of enteric viruses in an urban watershed, a rural sub
watershed and the Milwaukee River mouth, WI, USA. The authors processed large volumes of water samples (56–2800 L) over a 17 months
duration to account for variability throughout changing hydrologic
and extended (24-h) low-ﬂow periods. Human and bovine viruses
were detected in 49 and 41% of samples (n = 63), respectively. All
human viruses analyzed were detected at least once including HAdV
(40% of samples), norovirus (NoV) GI (10%), enterovirus (EV) (8%), rotavirus (RoV) (6%), NoV GII (1.6%) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (1.6%).
Human viruses were present in 63% of runoff samples resulting from
precipitation and snowmelt, and 20% of low-ﬂow samples. Maximum
human virus concentrations were N2.47 log10 GC/L.
Steele et al. (2018) used digital qPCR to quantify a number of bacterial and viral pathogens in stormwater samples from multiple storm
events from two different watersheds that discharge to popular surf
beaches in San Diego, CA, USA. This is the most comprehensive study
reviewed that determined the concentrations of several human health
signiﬁcant pathogens in stormwater discharges in the USA. Among the
enteric viruses tested, NoV were highly prevalent in both the San
Diego River and Tourmaline Creek with concentration ranging from
1.39 to 2.69 log10 GC/100 mL of water. The prevalence of HAdV were
much lower than NoV; 9% of the samples in Tourmaline creek and 22%
of the samples in San Diego River were positive for HAdV with concentration ranging from 1.14 to 1.61 log10 HAdV GC/100 mL of water. Enterovirus was not detected in any of the water samples tested. Among
the two bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp.),
Campylobacter spp. was the most commonly detected pathogens (100
and 45% samples were positive at San Diego River and Tourmaline
Creek, respectively compared to 25 and 10% samples were positive for
Salmonella spp. at San Diego River and Tourmaline Creek, respectively.
C. coli (87%) and C. lari (78%) were the most frequently detected species
in stormwater discharges from San Diego River, while C. lari (48%) and
C. jejuni (29%) were the most commonly detected in Tourmaline
Creek. The authors stated that such data is an important step forward
for assessing risk associated with stormwater.
Data generated using qPCR need to be interpreted carefully because
qPCR assays quantify both viable and dead pathogens and do not provide information on the infectivity status of the pathogen tested. Also,
complex water matrix such as stormwater generally contain various organic substances, salts, acid and detergents which may inhibit PCR

reaction. PCR inhibitory substances may produce false negative results
of pathogens in stormwater samples. For example, Corsi et al. (2014) reported a 63% inhibition rate across virus analysis, while Steele et al.
(2018) reported 10–15% inhibition rate. This problem can be overcome
by including a sample processing control (SPC) (Shanks et al., 2016).

Digital qPCR may also offer an advantage over qPCR when dealing
with samples with inhibitory substances (Dingle et al., 2013; Cao
et al., 2016). This is because in digital qPCR sample is partitioned into
many wells are droplets unlike qPCR which measures the target as it
occurs with comparison with a standard curve.



W. Ahmed et al. / Science of the Total Environment 692 (2019) 1304–1321

Cizek et al. (2008) characterized the partitioning behaviour of Cryptosporidium and Giardia with traditional and alternative fecal indicators
(E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and Clostridium perfringens) and a viral surrogate (coliphage) in stormwater runoff. Both protozoa exhibited similar
levels of particle association during dry weather (roughly 30%) with
an increased level observed during wet weather events (Giardia 60%
and Cryptosporidium 40%). During wet weather events, FIB, coliphage
and protozoa concentrations increased (~1–2 orders of magnitude) in
tributaries examined in the Kensico Reservoir. FIB did not exhibit a
strong one-to-one relationship with Cryptosporiduum or Giardia in
terms of total concentration or the settleable fraction in the Kensico Reservoir. The authors also found C. perfringens spores (Spearman r = 0.13
and coliphage r = 0.11) were the best indicators for Cryptosporidium.
This is because the inactivation rates of C. perfringens and C. parvum
were reported to be in the same order of magnitude (Hijnen et al.,
2000).
In general, concentrations of pathogens in stormwater are poorly reported and some data may not be useful to infer risk or for quantitative
microbial risk assessment (QMRA). For example, several studies have
failed to detect or provided the percentage of samples positive for pathogens without giving quantitative numbers (Surbeck et al., 2006; Rajal
et al., 2007; Sidhu et al., 2012a; Bambic et al., 2015). Most of the
stormwater studies determined the concentrations of genus Cryptosporidium and Giardia. However, in urban stormwater there is evidence
that most samples do not contain human infectious genotypes that are
capable of causing illnesses in humans rather contain genotypes that infect animals. For instance, data from Jiang (2004) studying three United
States sewered urban stormwater catchments found that only about 5%
of around 100 Cryptosporidium oocyst types characterized were potentially human-infective.
Recent studies reported high risks due to Campylobacter spp.
through reuse of stormwater in the Netherlands (Sales-Ortells and
Medema, 2015) and Australia (Murphy et al., 2017). These studies,
however, only measured members of the genus Campylobacter to estimate risk. Genus Campylobacter is comprised of 25 species, two provisional species and eight sub-species, with only a few species of human
health signiﬁcance (Man, 2011). Further research should focus on determining the levels of C. jejuni, C. coli or other pathogenic species such as
C. lari and C. upsaliensis in stormwater for more accurate risk
assessment.
Finally, the persistence of pathogens in stormwater compared to
wastewater or other matrices has not been well characterized but can
provide useful information for QMRA. A systematic review by Boehm
et al. (2018) of pathogen persistence in surface waters indicated few
decay constants available for protozoan and viral pathogens or viral surrogates, with viruses having the greatest degree of persistence. A comparison of the HF183 MST marker with NoV indicated that the ﬁrst
order decay coefﬁcient k was higher for HF183 than NoV. To the author's
knowledge, a similar meta-analysis has not been performed for pathogens in stormwater. Sidhu et al. (2015) estimated a T90 value of
b3 days for bacterial pathogens, and b120 days and N200 days for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and enteric viruses, respectively in recycled
stormwater used for managed aquifer recharge. Due to the persistence
of viral pathogens, these microorganisms are likely to drive concerns
for human health risk.
5. Health risk assessment approaches
Various approaches for assessing the health risks of microbial contaminants have been applied in the stormwater context including epidemiological approaches and quantitative microbial risk assessment
(QMRA) models. Epidemiological studies observe patterns of disease
in conjunction with environmental exposure and provide inferences
rooted in observed health outcomes, and for this reason are highly valuable for assessing health risks. The ﬁndings of several epidemiological
studies have supported a relationship between stormwater exposure

1311

and waterborne illness for stormwater-impacted waterbodies (Haile
et al., 1999; Colford Jr et al., 2007; Soller et al., 2017). However, due to
the study sizes and expense required to achieve predictive power in epidemiological studies and difﬁculty attributing risks to a particular exposure source and/or pathway, often QMRA approaches are used to
assess risks where effect sizes are projected to be small due to low environmental concentrations. QMRA uses a process of hazard identiﬁcation, exposure assessment, dose response analysis, and risk
characterization to predict the risk of an infection or disease- related
outcome based on an exposure to environmental media (Haas et al.,
2014). To the author's knowledge, there has not been an epidemiological study for potable or non-potable uses of stormwater resources. However, studies by Ashbolt and Bruno (2003) and Soller et al. (2017) have
demonstrated the utility of combining both epidemiological and QMRA
information where feasible for stormwater-affected waterbodies.
Undertaking QMRA for various exposures to stormwater can nevertheless be challenging due to difﬁculties in discerning the sources and
concentrations of pathogen contamination in stormwater, and assumptions regarding pathogen sources, fate, and transport are needed depending on the availability of site-speciﬁc information. Several (n =
16) QMRA studies have relied upon concentrations of pathogens observed in stormwater-impacted coastal, recreational waters, or drinking
source waters for assessment of health risks (Donovan et al., 2008;
Soller et al., 2010; ten Veldhuis et al., 2010; Fewtrell et al., 2011; Tseng
and Jiang, 2012; Andersen et al., 2013; McBride et al., 2013; de Man
et al., 2014; Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2014; Schoen et al., 2014;
Soller et al., 2014; Adell et al., 2016; Krkosek et al., 2016; Lim et al.,
2017; Soller et al., 2015; Soller et al., 2017), and two have used other
modelling approaches for microbial health risks such as Bayesian network modelling (Goulding et al., 2012) or disease transmission models
(Soller et al., 2006). These recreational water QMRAs are reviewed in
detail by Federigi et al. (2019). However, few studies have conducted
a QMRA for potable and non-potable reuse exposures to stormwater
(Table 3). The focus on potable and non-potable uses here is due to
the difﬁculty of comparing recreational exposures with multiple nonpoint as well as point sources of contamination with stormwater-only
exposures. Stormwater-impacted recreational waterbody exposures
using FIB as well as pathogens as index pathogens were very high in
some cases, up to 1.0 for a homeless population ingesting Giardia, for example (Donovan et al., 2008). The risks from potable and non-potable
uses of stormwater in Table 3 varied substantially depending on the target pathogen and exposure scenario. Risks were considered highest for
viral pathogens, in most cases exceeding risk benchmarks for potable
and non-potable use with the exception of toilet ﬂushing in some
cases (Lim et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2017). The studies summarized
in Table 3 indicate that potable and non-potable exposures to
stormwater are likely to exceed water quality targets [e.g. up to a geometric 240 CFU/ mL for recycled water (USEPA, 2012b)] and risk benchmarks (10−4 probability of infection or 10−6 disability adjusted life
years per person per year (pppy) in the absence of additional treatment
and/or BMPs depending on the area, end use, and source water. Microbial risks from harvested rainwater are considered as captured
stormwater but have been reviewed elsewhere (Hamilton et al., 2019).
Factors such as temporal, regional, and compositional complexity of
stormwater can make the quantiﬁcation of pathogens more difﬁcult
than for some other matrices. Once concentration values are obtained,
values can be corrected for recovery efﬁciency in a QMRA, however,
low or variable recovery efﬁciencies can also complicate QMRA analysis.
Furthermore, concentrations observed at the point of exposure may not
be indicative of realistic exposure scenarios over time as they typically
are not observed after a rainfall event during presumably peak pathogen
concentrations, or dilution occurs at the point of exposure that in some
cases will render concentrations of pathogens below the analytical detection limit (McBride et al., 2013). These factors must be taken into account when constructing QMRA models. Previous studies of pathogens
in stormwater discharges have relied upon small samples sizes (Sidhu

et al., 2012a, 2012b; McBride et al., 2013; Sales-Ortells and Medema,
2015), limiting the ability to capture the large variability in stormwater
pathogen concentrations due to potentially diverse fecal contamination
sources (human and multiple animal fecal wastes, affecting the types of
index pathogens chosen for the QMRA), rainfall patterns, decay rates,
and other factors.
Monitoring efforts conducted to inform QMRAs by Petterson et al.
(2016) and McBride et al. (2013) conﬁrmed that variability in pathogen
concentration is indeed high between rainfall and baseline events.
There is therefore a need to look at a scenario-conditional risk estimate
(sometimes referred to as “conditional risk”), rather than averaging or
annualizing over time without regard to rainfall events. Pathogens can
survive on urban surfaces and building materials, for example, and
could furthermore be introduced into stormwater during subsequent
rain events without the presence of an ongoing fecal source. This further
supports the need for comparison of stormwater wet-weather risks
with dry event (baseline) risks (Taylor et al., 2013).
Some of the principal challenge in conducting a QMRA for
stormwater is determining the concentration of pathogens in
stormwater discharges or harvesting systems, and addressing the complexities of their transport and inactivation prior to arrival at a human
receptor. In lieu of a detailed hydrodynamic or fate and transport
models for pathogens, simpliﬁed assumptions of decay and dilution between a pathogen source and human receptor are often made. Dilution
factors are sometimes applied to estimate pathogen loads between
stormwater and receiving recreational bodies; for example, McBride
et al. (2013) used a 30-fold dilution factor applied to the concentrations
of pathogens observed in stormwater discharges. Other studies have applied an estimated microbial decay factor for particular pathogens or indicators as surrogates for pathogens in stormwater, sometimes also
coupled with a dilution factor (Petterson et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2015).
The use of hydrodynamic mixing and inactivation models such as
those applied by Andersen et al. (2013) could be used to obtain more accurate site-speciﬁc dilution information, or a distribution of dilution factors could be incorporated into a Monte Carlo approach in QMRA
models as performed in Soller et al., 2017.
Improved characterization of different removal values for bacteria,
protozoans and viruses in stormwater treatment processes can also improve QMRA estimates, as previous estimates have been based on FIB
rather than pathogens themselves due to limited data (Davies et al.,
2008; Page et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2010d; Petterson et al., 2016).
Limited information is available for pathogen removal by stormwater
treatment barriers and would be informative for conducting risk

analyses. Additionally, these values can be compared with theoretical
LRVs necessary to meet health risk targets (NRMMC-EPHC-AHMC,
2009; Page et al., 2015; Schoen and Garland, 2015; Schoen et al., 2017).
As stormwater concentrations of pathogens cannot always be directly measured, impacts to stormwater can also be estimated;
Petterson et al. (2016) modelled avian contamination of stored
stormwater resources with birds colonized by Campylobacter and Salmonella as well as pathogen inputs from human sewage using an epidemiologic approach, making use of information about disease incidence,
pathogen excretion and known sewage ﬂow rates to approximate loading rates in a typical sewage. Several recent studies used QMRA analysis
to determine HF183 concentrations that represent human health risks
to swimmers based on the recreational water quality criteria (RWQC)
risk benchmark of 36/1000 primary contact recreators (USEPA, 2012a;
Boehm et al., 2015; Ahmed et al., 2018d). Such approaches can also be
undertaken to determine the health risks associated with different
stormwater end use where the pathogen data is lacking or not available.
QMRA can be a useful tool for examining the potential human health
risks related to rainfall events and can inform risk management practices (Bichai and Ashbolt, 2017). These assessments show that there
are non-trivial risks associated with the use of stormwater resources
to supplement water portfolios and in some cases guidelines are not sufﬁcient to mitigate risks (Murphy et al., 2017). This is needed as
stormwater harvesting areas can create new opportunities for comingling of potential animal habitats or reservoirs for animal fecal material and human recreational environments, where transmission of
fecal pathogens can occur (Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2015; Petterson
et al., 2016). While acknowledging the utility of QMRA, caution must
be exercised when comparing risk estimates from QMRAs employing
different methodologies. For example, a direct comparison of annual infection risks and annual disability adjusted life years (DALYs) (pppy)
should be interpreted carefully as these methodologies can lead to different risk conclusions when compared to guideline values (Lim et al.,
2015). Furthermore, it has been suggested that drinking water benchmarks could be too stringent for comparison with alternative water
uses in some cases and warrants consideration of the development of
more applicable guideline values (Mara, 2011; Schoen and Garland,
2015).
6. Reduction of microbial contaminants through WSUD/BMPs
Elevated levels of microbial contaminants in stormwater is of great
concern for water safety. As a result, there is regulatory pressure to



1316

W. Ahmed et al. / Science of the Total Environment 692 (2019) 1304–1321

remove contaminants so that risk benchmarks can be met. A variety of
microbial contaminant mitigation measures can be used including the
implementation of various types of stormwater infrastructure
(Thurston et al., 2001; Struck et al., 2008). Fletcher et al. (2015) undertook a review of terminology associated with urban stormwater management in different countries. The terms reviewed included: WSUD,
BMPs, Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM), Low Impact
Urban Design and Development (LIUDD), Low Impact Development
(LID), Green Infrastructure, and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems
(SUDS). Their review identiﬁed that whilst the concepts are all
underpinned by the principles of reducing disturbance to natural hydrology and mitigating the water quality impacts of urbanisation,
there are subtle differences in the scope and focus of terms (Fletcher
et al., 2015). However, for the purposes of this review the terms can
be considered broadly analogous and are hereafter referred to as
“WSUD”.
WSUD takes an integrated approach to managing stormwater that
protects public health, while also mitigating the environmental impacts
of urban development and provides for improved community amenity.
WSUD has the objective of reducing the impact of urbanisation on the
natural water cycle, and its principles can be applied at a range of scales
(Lloyd et al., 2002). Davies (1996) proposed that, fundamentally, WSUD
strives to maintain the water balance and water quality of an urbanized
environment in much the same state as prior to urbanisation.
The approaches taken to implement WSUD will depend upon the
development context and drivers for the adoption of WSUD. WSUD approaches often use a ‘treatment train’ where a series of treatment approaches are used to meet stormwater objectives. The approaches
applied will depend upon the catchment characteristics, climate conditions and discharge requirements. Often the initial stages of a WSUD
treatment train will focus on the removal of coarse sediments, which
can help improve the treatment effectiveness of subsequent stages
that use ﬁltration and/or biological processes. In addition to the WSUD
treatment approaches summarized below, non-structural catchmentscale approaches can be used to improve quality of runoff discharged
to receiving waters (Wong, 2006). This can include buffers around waterways that limit potentially polluting land uses, and the revegetation
of riparian zones. For example, Bryan et al. (2009) described the use of
an adaptive management framework to reduce Cryptosporidium risk in
an agricultural catchment in South Australia.
Although information regarding the degree of pathogen removal
from various WSUDs can help for water quality managers and urban
planners to design and maintain systems that adequately protect public
health, data available on speciﬁc LRVs of pathogens through WSUD is
limited (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2009). Most studies have employed
FIB to derive the LRVs of microbial removal in speciﬁc WSUD treatment
processes and as such, and there is much less information on the removal of speciﬁc pathogens such as viruses and protozoa which have
very different physico-chemical characteristics. A range of factors have
an impact on the treatment capability of WSUD systems. The removal
of pathogens varies from system to system and therefore, it may be useful to assess individual systems in-situ to account for local variability
resulting from factors such as sedimentation, sunlight exposure, water
temperature, and adsorption/desorption with bioﬁlms (Jiang et al.,
2015). Peng et al., 2016 highlighted that most microbe focused studies
of stormwater bioﬁlters focus on FIB, which are measured by culturebased methods, and less frequently by molecular based methods.
These studies may be difﬁcult to extrapolate to pathogens. There are
few studies on the removal of pathogens, particularly viruses, in
stormwater by bioﬁltration. Peng et al. (2016) also noted the need for
more studies that use ﬁeld-based measurements, rather than laboratory
settings, as it captures the more variable and complex features of the
urban environment that inﬂuences how effective WSUD approaches
are likely to be in reducing pathogen loads.
One key resource for LRV in WSUD is the International Stormwater
BMP Database. The database contains approximately 600 pairs of

inﬂuent and efﬂuent data for fecal coliforms and E. coli. Among the
600 pairs, 100 pairs belong to E. coli from 12 sites in Portland, Oregon
and the remaining 500 pairs are fecal coliform collected from 61 sites
in California, Florida, Virginia, Ontario, New York, Texas, Georgia,
North Carolina, and Oregon. Clary et al. (2008) analyzed the fecal coliform and E. coli datasets in the International Stormwater BMP database
and provided results on how BMPs can effectively reduce fecal indicator
concentrations in order to assist in meeting total maximum daily load
(TMDL) goals. Swales and detention basins did not appear to effectively
reduce FIB in efﬂuent samples. Datasets for wetlands and manufactured
devices were not of adequate size to draw meaningful conclusions. The
authors concluded that the ability of BMPs to reduce FIB varies widely
within BMP categories. No single BMP appears to be able to consistently
reduce FIB in efﬂuent to levels below instream primary contact recreation standard. Among the BMPs, retention pond and media ﬁlters appeared to have potential for bacteria removal in efﬂuent.
Chandrasena et al. (2016) studied the removal of E. coli and Campylobacter spp. from urban stormwater by ﬁeld-scale bioﬁlters. E. coli
LRVs (average 1.23–1.39 LRVs) were greater than that of Campylobacter
spp. (average 0.88–0.99 LRVs) in both bioﬁlters. The authors did not ﬁnd
any correlation between E. coli and Campylobacter spp. log removal performance suggesting that single organisms should not be employed to
understand pathogen removal in urban stormwater treatment systems.
Such variations may affect performance evaluation as well as the impact of other factors including the selection of plants, use of a submerged zone in bioﬁlters, and operation under wet vs. dry conditions
(Jiang et al., 2015; Chandrasena et al., 2016). Generally, a one log10 removal of FIB and pathogens can be expected if bioﬁlters are properly designed accordingly to local guidance (Bichai and Ashbolt, 2017).
However, the performance of such systems can be site speciﬁc, and
therefore, undertaking in situ validation of speciﬁc devices has been recommended (Payne et al., 2015). While individual WSUD technologies
performances are available, there is an expectation that there would
be an improved or increased performance for the removal of contaminants when water is passed through a series of WSUD technologies
prior to (re)use (Vogel et al., 2015).
This not only can increase the amount of contaminants removed, but
can also enable a level of redundancy to be built in so that if treatment of
an individual WSUD technologies declines, the resulting reduction in
treatment capacity is covered by the rest of the WSUD treatment system. In addition, residence time is important for the removal of microorganisms, so the longer water is held within a WSUD treatment system,
the greater the pathogen removal rates.
Table 4 provides information on the studied removal capacity of a
range of WSUD treatment systems. While there is variability in the removal capacity of the different reported WSUD systems, in general all
of these systems achieved 0.5 to 1 LRV for FIB and the bacterial pathogen
Campylobacter. The results also show that bacterial removal is faster (or
higher) than viral and protozoan pathogens, which tend to be more resistant to treatment processes, and therefore more able to survive
through the different WSUD treatments. This is due to the differences
in size surface characteristics, mode of reproduction and life cycle of viruses and protozoa which are different than those of bacteria (Hoff and
Akin, 1986). In general, sequential treatment systems with a series of
ponds, wetlands or combinations tend to improve pathogen removal
from source water. For example, Reinoso et al. (2008) evaluated the removal of a variety of traditional and alternative fecal indicators such as
coliphages, total coliform, E. coli, fecal streptococci and C. perfringens and
pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. from domestic
sewage in a treatment train including pond storage followed by surface
and subsurface wetlands, with the overall Cryptosporidium and Giardia
removal efﬁciency found to be as high as two log10. A new potential
WSUD treatment component currently being studied is the addition of
heavy metal (e.g., copper) labelled zeolite to ﬁltration bed media. Laboratory research has demonstrated that copper coated zeolite can have
LRV capability for bacteria such as E. coli greater than three log10 (Li



W. Ahmed et al. / Science of the Total Environment 692 (2019) 1304–1321

et al., 2012). Stormwater can also be contaminated with viral and protozoan pathogens, both of which have higher treatment requirements
than bacteria. However, the information on the effect of zeolites coated
with heavy metals on these enteric non-bacterial pathogens is very limited. Silver/copper coated zeolites could reduce coronavirus by 2–3 LRVs
(Bright et al., 2009) and silver-impregnated ﬁltration pots reduced Giardia and Cryptosporidium by at least 96% (~1.5 LRV) (Adeyemo et al.,
2015). More research would be needed to assess the treatment potential of copper-coated zeolite on a range of enteric viruses and protozoa
under in-ﬁeld conditions before its use could be justiﬁed as beneﬁcial
for the cost, particularly for the removal of pathogens.
7. Stormwater treatment and risk mitigation
Stormwater harvesting systems generally require some level of
treatment to minimise operational risks. Additional treatment may
also be required for higher exposure uses to manage human health
and environmental risks. The operational risks relating to stormwater
quality are usually managed by the use of BMPs/WSUDs. For example
gross pollutant traps and vegetated swales to remove sediment and
leaves entering the stormwater harvesting scheme and potentially
blocking pipes, irrigation nozzles or drip irrigation systems, or damaging pumps. Use of wetlands and bio retentive systems can also assist
in reducing high loads of organic matter (e.g. leaf fall) as well as removing nitrogen and phosphorus through phytoremediation. Additional
levels of treatment are often required to manage human health risks,
where stormwater from a sewered residential catchment is used for
public, open-space irrigation (e.g. in schools and sporting ovals). Here,
human health risks can be managed by the use of on-site access controls
to minimise exposure to irrigation water. For example, the use of withholding periods on public recreation ovals has been recommended to
reduce the risks from pathogens (Page et al., 2014b).
Additional treatments may be required for higher exposure usages,
for example the Australian Guidelines for Stormwater Harvesting and
Reuse (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2009) describes the derivation of
these criteria in terms of LRVs and also lists default LRV values for a
range of engineered treatments. These accepted default LRV tables can
be then used along with catchment speciﬁc knowledge where possible
exposure controls are used to determine the required level of treatment
for pathogens. For example, Page et al. (2012) reported that risks from
viruses have the highest required LRV targets and if they are met then
protozoan and bacterial LRV targets will also be met. It was reported
that for open space irrigation requires b2.0 LRV is sufﬁcient for
stormwater recycled via an aquifer and this can potentially be managed
using chlorination and exposure controls. However, if in the same system where stormwater is recycled via an aquifer were to be used for
drinking water, a LRV of 5.5 would be required to manage human health
risks from viruses (Page et al., 2014c). Generally these default LRVs
apply where there has been no stormwater catchment-speciﬁc assessment of the health risks posed by the quality of the stormwater.
Where such a site speciﬁc risk assessment has been performed, alternative treatment could be adopted (e.g., lower LRV targets may be adopted
where microbial source tracking has found negligible sewage contamination in a catchment).
8. Research gaps and conclusions
• Monitoring of FIB in stormwater may not be useful unless synergistically used with MST marker genes such as HF183, crAssphage or
Lachno3 which are able to differentiate between sources of fecal contamination. This will provide additional information on the human
health risks associated with stormwater from point and non-point
sources of fecal contamination. Identifying and quantifying sources
of human sewage in stormwater is most important followed by cattle
due to the presence of a wide array of enteric viruses and zoonotic
pathogens in these sources.

1317

• The concentration of pathogens in stormwater, outfalls and receiving
environmental waters can be high, especially in urban areas. Monitoring of traditional FIB takes 24–48 h and does not provide real-time information on the quality of recreational water. This is important from
a human health perspective. Swimming area closure causes economic
losses. Therefore, it is recommended that a rapid pathogen monitoring
toolbox and standardized methods need to be developed that are able
to quantify a number of reference pathogens in waterbodies with increased accuracy, reliability, and less technical training under various
conditions. The toolbox can be used either in the laboratory or in the
ﬁeld to provide a rapid assessment whether the stormwater from a
particular storm event presents a hazard to public health.
• Most of the stormwater quality monitoring studies focused on determining the concentrations of pathogens in urban stormwater. However, more data is required on the concentration of pathogens in
stormwater sourced from a range of land uses. While sewage discharges are relatively well characterized, there remain gaps in our understanding of runoff from nonpoint sources. More studies are
required to determine the concentrations of zoonotic pathogens in
stormwater.
• Fecal contamination in stormwater is largely dependent on the land
uses and mostly include sewage, septage and various animal feces.
Therefore it is imperative to determine the sources of contamination.
This will in turn provide a basis for cost-effective remediation and information on the immediate human health risks in stormwater impacted waters. Currently used FIB monitoring approaches are
inadequate due to their presence in both human and animal feces.
An MST toolbox comprised of various human and animal fecesassociated marker genes needs to be employed which will allow managers to quickly identify the relative contribution of point and nonpoint sources of fecal contamination.
• The quality of stormwater in terms of microbial contaminants is
poorly understood. Microbial risk will be the dominant acute health
risks on stormwater reuse due to the risk of waterborne pathogens
(Hrudey and Hrudey, 2014). However, in some cases, chemical risks
may be the driving health concern and relationships between multicontaminant exposures should be explored. Few QMRA studies addressing potable and non-potable exposures to stormwater were
available. Most of the QMRA studies are based on conservative assumptions. More data are required on the concentrations of pathogens and recovery from water samples across sites and stormwater
hydrographs. In addition, improved understanding of the inﬂuence
of catchment characteristics and baseline levels of pathogens, meteorological factors, and decay of pathogens is required for accurate
QMRA estimates.
• Different types of WSUD and BMPs are able to reduce microbial contamination, however, reliable information is still lacking on the performance of these treatment barriers. Standardized natural
treatment validation protocol needs to be developed. Most studies determined the efﬁcacy of WSUD or BMPs on the removal of microorganisms using FIB, while one or two studies investigated the LRVs of
protozoa pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. or Giardia spp.
Given the differences in size and characteristics of different groups
of pathogens, it is unlikely that FIB LRVs will be representative for
pathogens especially enteric viruses. Therefore, studies should focus
on determining the removal of enteric viruses and other pathogens
(i.e., bacterial and protozoans) of interest to determine the removal
rates through different types of WSUD and BMPs, simultaneously.
These data will be important for evaluating the effectiveness of
WSUD/BMPs for reducing microbial contaminants in the receiving environments and can support improved QMRA models. The evaluation
will focus not only on the performance of individual component of
WSUD/BMPs but also on a series of different types of BMPs.
• Little is known regarding the decay of pathogens in stormwater or
outfalls, and the relative differences in persistence between FIB, pathogens, and host-associated markers. As stormwater becomes aged,

pathogens will start to decay and as result, the human health risks will

The research gaps discussed in this paper and other uncertainties associated with the performance of stormwater treatment systems needs to
be investigated. Health risks can be assessed using a QMRA analysis,
thus facilitating decision-making and risk management efforts. This
may, in turn, increase the conﬁdence of regulators and public health
managers for adopting stormwater practice widely.

9. Conclusions
Stormwater reuse can contribute to water conservation and water
quality improvement and be a great water source to meet the everincreasing demand on water supplies. However, human and environmental health risks associated with stormwater need to be assessed
carefully. This is due to the presence of fecal pollution and associated
pathogen in stormwater that are capable of causing illnesses in humans.
