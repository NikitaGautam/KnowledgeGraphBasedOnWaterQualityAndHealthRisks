To understand physician practices regarding the diagnosis of acute diarrheal diseases, we conducted a survey,
in 1996, of 2839 physicians in Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Oregon, and California. Bacterial stool culture
was requested for samples from the last patient seen for acute diarrhea by 784 (44%; 95% confidence interval,
42%–46%) of 1783 physicians. Physicians were more likely to request a culture for persons with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, bloody stools, travel to a developing country, diarrhea for 13 days, intravenous
rehydration, or fever. Substantial geographic and specialty differences in culture-request practices were observed. Twenty-eight percent of physicians did not know whether stool culture included testing for Escherichia
coli O157:H7; 40% did not know whether Yersinia or Vibrio species were included. These variabilities suggest
a need for clinical diagnostic guidelines for diarrhea. Many physicians could benefit from education to improve
their knowledge about tests included in routine stool examinations.
In May 1997, a multimillion-dollar food safety initiative
was begun, to improve the United States’ capacity to
detect and respond to foodborne diseases. One goal of
the initiative is to enhance surveillance for foodborne
diseases through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet). This network is the primary foodborne disease component of the Emerging
Infections Program of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and was begun in 1994, in part-

state health departments of California, Connecticut,
Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and
Tennessee; the US Department of Agriculture, Food
Safety and Inspection Service; and the US Food and
Drug Administration. The objectives of FoodNet are to
determine and monitor the burden of foodborne disease over time, to determine the causes of selected foodborne diseases, and to provide a framework for rapid,
collaborative responses to foodborne diseases. FoodNet
focuses on diarrheal illnesses, because most foodborne
infections cause diarrhea.
FoodNet investigators conducted the present study
to determine the diagnostic practices of physicians who
treat patients with acute diarrhea. Physicians who request stool specimens from such patients are essential
contributors to foodborne disease surveillance that is

METHODS
We conducted a population-based mail survey of physicians in
FoodNet surveillance areas (also called “FoodNet sites”) to determine what proportion of physicians report requesting stool
specimens from patients with diarrhea and what patient and
physician characteristics are associated with a stool specimen
request. In 1996, the surveillance area of the FoodNet sites
included counties in California (Alameda and San Francisco),
Connecticut (Hartford and New Haven), and Georgia (Clayton,
Cobb, Dekalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Newton, and Rockdale) and the entire states of Minnesota and Oregon. According
to the US Census Bureau, the 1996 population estimate for
these areas was 14,281,096 persons. All licensed physicians with
a nonsurgical specialty who were likely to treat persons with
acute diarrhea and who practiced in the surveillance areas were
eligible for inclusion. The specialties included were emergency
medicine, family practice, general practice, internal medicine
(including subspecialties), obstetrics and gynecology, pediatric
medicine (including subspecialties), primary care osteopathic
physicians, and public health. After 21,653 physicians were
identified through state licensure lists, a random sample of
∼5000 physicians (1000 in each FoodNet site) was devised, and
∼1250 surveys (250 in each site) were mailed during each calendar quarter of 1996. The questionnaire was pretested in each
site, and physicians who participated in this preliminary phase
were excluded from the data-gathering phase. The goal was to
obtain a 60% response rate of completed surveys. Appropriate
informed consent was obtained from patients, and the study
was conducted in accordance with guidelines for human reS204 • CID 2004:38 (Suppl 3) • Hennessy et al.

search as specified by the US Department of Health and Human
Services.
The 4-page questionnaire was accompanied by a letter that
explained the project and intended uses of the data and a
stamped, self-addressed return envelope. No financial incentives were given to respondents, and no personal identifying
information was collected with the data. If no response was
received in 2 weeks, a second survey was mailed with a similar
cover letter. If no response was received in 2 more weeks, a
telephone call or facsimile transmission was made, when possible, to verify the mailing address and encourage participation
of the nonrespondents before a third mailing.
Acute diarrhea was defined as ⭓3 loose stools during a 24h period that had lasted for !7 days before presentation. Background information collected included the physician’s specialty,
practice type, training status, the percentage of patients referred
to the physician, the percentage of patients in the practice who
were infected with HIV, the number of outpatients seen during
the previous 7 days, the number of outpatients with acute
diarrhea seen during the previous 7 days, the number of persons
hospitalized for treatment of acute diarrhea, and the total number of hospitalized patients treated during the previous 7 days.
The survey focused on the last patient with acute diarrhea
seen by the provider, the last patient with bloody diarrhea seen
by the provider, and the laboratory tests performed for a routine
stool culture. It also included hypothetical scenarios asking
whether the physician would order bacterial stool culture or
stool ova and parasite (O&P) examination for a 30-year-old
patient with 7 different clinical presentations. Pediatricians and
a subset of family physicians were sent surveys that differed
only by the age of the patient identified in the hypothetical
scenarios (3 years old) and a question about the diagnostic
evaluation of an ill child attending day care. Researchers in
Connecticut and Georgia did not include any questions about
O&P testing in their surveys.
Data were entered into Epi-Info, version 6 (CDC, Atlanta,
GA), and analysis was conducted in SAS, version 6.11 software
(SAS Institute). Differences in proportions were assessed by
Fisher’s exact test. The x2 test was used to assess trends among
univariate comparisons. Summary proportions were weighted
according to the selection probabilities of the sample frame for
each site. Variables that, according to univariate analysis, were
associated with a request for a bacterial stool culture, and the
first-order interaction terms between these variables were entered into a backward-elimination logistic-regression model, to
develop a parsimonious multivariable model. The patient clinical characteristics included in the final model were the objective
measures that were most strongly associated with the outcome
variable. They were not significantly correlated with each other,
yet they showed a high degree of correlation with the excluded
clinical characteristic variables. Interaction terms were assessed

borne infection. However, only a fraction of cases of foodborne
disease are reported to the CDC. For example, if a case of
diarrhea caused by Salmonella infection is to be reported, the
patient must first seek medical care, a stool specimen must be
obtained and submitted to a laboratory for culture, the laboratory must test for and isolate the organism, and the positive
culture result must be reported to a health department and
then to the CDC. If any step in this process does not occur,
the illness will not be reported. Each reported case of Salmonella
is estimated to represent 38 unreported cases [4, 5]. Thus,
information on the factors that influence physicians’ diagnostic
choices for patients with diarrhea are needed to understand the
strengths and weaknesses of the foodborne disease surveillance
system and to better estimate the magnitude of foodborne disease in the United States. To our knowledge, our investigation
was the first population-based assessment of US physician diagnostic practices for patients with acute diarrhea and provides
data that are relevant to health care providers, public health
professionals, and those concerned with the diagnosis and management of acute diarrheal diseases.



using the Wald x2 test; P p .05 was considered significant. CIs
were generated using Fisher’s exact method in univariate analyses, and Wald confidence limits were used for the multivariable
model. All P values shown are 2-tailed. The Hosmer-Lemeshow
goodness-of-fit test at the 5% significance level was used to
assess the overall fit of the model to the data.

Survey respondents. Of the 5074 surveys mailed, 2839 (56%)
were returned with responses. We included in our analysis the
1783 surveys received from physicians who practiced in the
surveillance areas, were involved in ⭓8 h of patient care per
week, and had treated a patient with acute diarrhea during the
previous 12 months (table 1). Eighty-four percent of these respondents were in the specialties of internal medicine (37%),
family practice (26%), or pediatrics (21%). Overall, 50% of
respondents classified their practice as primarily outpatient feefor-service, 18% had outpatient health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or managed care practice, 18% had hospitalbased practices, and 13% had other types of practices (table
1). Most respondents returned the first mailed survey (1619
physicians [57%]), whereas fewer responded to the second (772
[27%]) or the third mailings (319 [11%]) mailings, and data
were missing for 129 (5%).
Evaluation of the last patient seen with acute diarrhea.
The majority of these respondents (1301 [73%]) reported hav-

ing treated at least 1 patient with acute diarrhea during the 7
days before completing the survey, but fewer had sent such a
patient to the hospital (1523 [8.5%]) or treated a hospitalized
patient for acute diarrhea (187 [10.5%]) during the same time
period. Overall, 44% (784 of 1783) of respondents reported
requesting a stool culture for a specimen from the last patient
seen with acute diarrhea (95% CI, 0.42–0.46). Physicians in
Oregon were less likely than those in the other states (California,
Connecticut, Georgia, and Minnesota) to report requesting a
stool culture for the last patient seen with acute diarrhea (OR,
0.6; 95%, CI 0.5–0.8) (table 2). No such differences were observed among physicians from other states. There were no differences in the proportion of physicians who requested a stool
culture according to the month the survey was completed or
according to which of the 3 survey mailings was answered.
Physician practice characteristics. The likelihood that a
physician requested a stool culture for a stool sample obtained
from the last patient seen with diarrhea was evaluated with
respect to the physician’s practice characteristics (table 2). Data
from physicians with outpatient fee-for-service practices were
not different from those in outpatient HMO or hospital-based
practices in their likelihood to request a stool culture. The
likelihood of a stool culture request did increase with the overall
percentage of a physician’s patients who were referred from
another provider and with the proportion of a physician’s patients who were known to be infected with HIV. Stool-culture
requests were not associated with the number of outpatients

seen, the number of outpatients seen who had had diarrhea
during the 7 days before the survey, or the physician’s participation in a residency training program.
Characteristics of the last patient with diarrhea. The patient characteristics most strongly associated with a stool-culture request were a diagnosis of AIDS (OR, 6.2), bloody stools
(OR, 5.8), recent travel in a developing country (OR, 3.8), and
a duration of diarrhea of 13 days (OR, 3.2) (table 3). The
likelihood of a physician request for a stool culture was associated with subsequent hospitalization (OR, 6.4), referral to
(OR, 2.5) or from (OR, 2.7) another physician, and the need
for intravenous rehydration (OR, 2.7). If a patient was thought
to be part of an outbreak of diarrheal disease, the physician
was less likely to request a stool culture (OR, 0.5). Health
insurance status was not associated with a stool culture request.

the other patient characteristics were controlled for, bloody

diarrhea remained strongly associated with a stool-culture request (OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 5.8–21.6), followed by a diagnosis of
AIDS (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.5–13.9), and a duration of diarrhea
13 days (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 3.4–6.9).
Variability in stool-culture request by location and specialty. Substantial variability in stool-culture request practices was demonstrated among physicians in different geographic areas and specialties. In the multivariable model,
physicians in Oregon were less likely to request a stool culture
than were physicians in other states (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4–
0.7). Differences in physician’s diagnostic practices were also
shown by the presence of significant interactions in the multivariable model. For example, pediatricians were the specialists
most likely to request a culture for patients with bloody diarrhea
(94% of patients, vs. 67% for physicians in all other specialties),
but pediatricians were least likely to request a culture for patients with nonbloody diarrhea (24% vs. 44% of patients).

Thus, the relationship between specialty and diagnostic practice
changed for different levels of a third variable—bloody diarrhea. Another example of interaction involved obstetricians and
pediatricians: they were equally likely to request a stool culture
for patients with a duration of diarrhea of !3 days, but obstetricians were 4 times more likely to request a stool culture than
were pediatricians when the patient had a duration of diarrhea
of 13 days (95% CI, 2.1–7.1). In contrast, internists, family
physicians, and emergency department physicians were all significantly more likely to request a stool culture than were pediatricians, regardless of the duration of diarrhea. Geographic
variability was demonstrated as well: physicians in California
and Connecticut, were, on average, 3 times more likely to request a stool culture than were Oregon physicians, but no difference in stool-culture request practices was seen among these
physicians for patients with diarrhea lasting 13 days. By comparison, physicians in Minnesota and Georgia were much more
likely to request a stool culture than were Oregon physicians,
regardless of the duration of diarrhea.
Reasons for requesting a stool culture. Physicians were
asked to provide the reason they requested a stool culture for
their last patient with diarrhea. For physicians whose last patient had bloody stools, 93% stated that the bloody diarrhea
was the reason for requesting a stool culture. Other important
reasons for a stool culture request were a diagnosis of AIDS
(65% of physicians), a duration of diarrhea of 13 days (61%),
presence of fever (39%), and a history of travel in a developing
country (38%). These results are consistent with the patient
clinical characteristics that were associated with a stool-culture
request.

The most common reasons physicians gave for not requesting a stool culture for the last patient seen with diarrhea were
an illness of short duration (32%), a belief that a stool culture
would not yield a pathogen (25%), the absence of bloody diarrhea (22%), and a belief that culture results would not alter
the choice of treatment (12%). These reasons accounted for
189% of the responses. Uncommonly cited reasons for not
requesting a stool culture were the cost of the culture (!1%)
and patient refusal (!1%).
Diagnostic stool examinations: where tests were performed
and which tests were conducted. Ninety-seven percent of
respondents reported having requested at least 1 stool culture
during the preceding ast year; 27% reported that they requested
110 stool cultures. Twenty-two percent of physicians reported
using 11 laboratory for routine stool cultures. Eight percent of
respondents reported that their office-based laboratories perform stool cultures, 69% used a local hospital laboratory, and
53% used an independent laboratory. Physicians believed that
a routine stool culture included testing for Salmonella and Shigella species (99% of respondents), Campylobacter species
(95%), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (70%), and Yersinia (64%) and
Vibrio (44%) species. Twenty-eight percent of physicians were
uncertain whether E. coli O157:H7 was included in a routine
stool culture, and 140% were uncertain whether Yersinia and
Vibrio species were included.
Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that they had
requested at least 1 stool O&P examination during the preceding year; 27% had requested 110 such examinations. Eighteen percent of physicians reported using 11 laboratory for
O&P testing of stools. Eight percent of respondents used their

for a patient with AIDS. For the hypothetical pediatric patients,
the proportion who would order an O&P examination ranged
from 7% for a child who had 3 days of nonbloody diarrhea to
87% for an afebrile child with a 10-day history of nonbloody
diarrhea.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based survey to
evaluate the diagnostic practices of physicians in the United
States for patients with acute diarrhea. The physicians from
which the sample was drawn provided care for ∼6% of the
total US population and included practitioners in rural and
urban areas of the upper Midwest, the South, and both coasts.
On the basis of responses to our mail survey, bloody diarrhea,
diarrhea lasting 13 day, and a diagnosis of AIDS were the
patient factors that were most strongly associated with a stoolculture request. Overall, 44% of physician respondents recalled
requesting a stool culture for the last patient seen with acute
diarrhea. Significant geographic and specialty differences appeared to exist in diagnostic practices for patients with diarrhea,
and a large proportion of physicians was uncertain about what
constituted a routine stool examination. These data will allow
us to determine better what fraction of acute diarrheal illnesses

own office-based laboratories for O&P examinations, 67% used
local hospitals, and 42% used an independent laboratory. Many
physicians believed that a routine O&P examination included
testing for Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica (97% of
respondents) and Cryptosporidium (76%), Cyclospora (48%),
Isospora (53%), and Microsporidia (43%) species. However,
140% of respondents reported that they did not know whether
parasites other than Giardia species and E. histolytica were part
of a routine test.
Hypothetical patient scenarios. For the hypothetical adult
patient scenarios, the percentage of physicians who reported
that they would request a stool culture ranged from 26% for
a patient with 3 days of nonbloody diarrhea to 98% for a patient
with fever and bloody diarrhea (table 4). For the pediatric
patient scenarios, the proportion of physicians who would order a stool culture ranged from 7% for a child with 3 days of
nonbloody diarrhea to 99% for a child with fever and bloody
diarrhea. For adults and children, the additional findings of
fever, bloody stools, a diagnosis of AIDS, or a history of travel
in a developing country were all associated with an increase in
the proportion of physicians who would request a stool culture.
The proportion of physicians who would request a stool O&P
examination from a hypothetical adult patient ranged from 8%

outbreak, and if treatment of the patient is not likely to be
affected by the results of the diagnostic test. For infectiousdisease outbreak investigations, each laboratory-confirmed case
enhances the power of epidemiologic studies and increases the
likelihood that the outbreak’s source will be detected and
quickly controlled, thus preventing further illness. Therefore,
clinicians who are confronted by an apparent increase in the
incidence of diarrheal disease should consider increasing, rather
than decreasing, the proportion of patients from whom stool
samples are obtained, to ensure that the appropriate diagnostic
tests for the clinical and epidemiologic situation are ordered,
and to notify public health personnel of the apparent outbreak.
Cost considerations, unlike patient clinical characteristics,
were not associated with the likelihood of requesting a culture.
Among physicians who did not request a stool culture from
the last patient with diarrhea, !1% cited cost as the reason.
Furthermore, physicians reported that they were as likely to
request a stool culture for a patient with health insurance as
for a patient without health insurance. Physicians commonly
reported that the reason for not requesting a stool culture was
that the test was not likely to yield a pathogen or to alter the
chosen treatment. These findings indicated that the stool culture’s predictive value, rather than simply the cost, influenced
the physician’s diagnostic choice for patients with acute
diarrhea.
The recent increase in the proportion of persons who receive
medical care from HMO-based practices and the emphasis on
cost-cutting efforts in medical care have raised the possibility
that public health surveillance for diarrheal diseases may be
vulnerable to cost reductions. A significant reduction in the
proportion of patients with diarrhea who have samples tested
could have adverse consequences for the recognition, investigation, and control of outbreaks. Our data indicate that physicians in outpatient managed-care practices were as likely to
request a stool culture as those in outpatient fee-for-service or
private practices. However, because the nomenclature of managed care is rapidly changing and a provider may work under
several reimbursement systems simultaneously, misclassification of the physicians’ practice type in the survey may have
prevented us from thoroughly evaluating this question. Because
public health surveillance for diarrheal and foodborne diseases
relies on reports of laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, the influence of the changing medical marketplace on physician diagnostic practices deserves further investigation. Also, because the
survey was based on self-reported behavior, further data based
on actual physician practices are needed.
Some 44% (95% CI, 42%–46%) of physicians reported that
they requested a stool culture for the last patient seen with
acute diarrhea. In contrast, in a separate FoodNet survey of
the general population, 21% of patients with diarrhea reported
that a stool culture had been requested for them as a result of

is being measured by public health systems, to estimate better
the burden of illness caused by foodborne diarrheal diseases,
and to develop educational approaches for providers who treat
patients with acute diarrhea.
Public health surveillance for bacterial and parasitic diarrheal
diseases depends on clinicians requesting appropriate tests, the
identification of pathogens in clinical laboratories, and the reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases to state or local health
departments. Understanding the factors that influence physician’s diagnostic decisions can reveal the strengths and weakness of our current surveillance system. For example, physicians
were most likely to request a stool culture for patients with
bloody diarrhea. Diseases that frequently cause bloody diarrhea,
such as bacterial dysentery and E. coli 0157:H7 infections, are
more likely to be detected than diseases that seldom cause
bloody diarrhea, under the assumption that that the patient
seeks medical care, the proper diagnostic methods are used,
and cases are reported by the clinical laboratory. Diseases that
seldom cause bloody diarrhea are therefore less likely to be
diagnosed and may be underreported. Additionally, the patients
for whom stool cultures were most likely to have been ordered
were also the most ill, as shown by the strong association between requesting a culture and the need for hospitalization,
intravenous rehydration, a consultation with another provider,
or a diagnosis of AIDS. As a result, much of what we learn
through surveillance data about bacterial diarrhea is from the
subsample of those persons who are most ill.
Data from the present survey will aid in developing better
estimates of the burden of illness caused by foodborne diarrheal
diseases. We found that ∼44% of physicians requested a stool
culture for persons who sought care for acute diarrhea. Therefore, each stool culture request may represent ∼2.3 persons
(1 ⫼ 0.44) with diarrhea who seek care. By also knowing the
proportion of persons who seek care for diarrhea, the proportion of stool cultures that yield a pathogen, and the proportion
of confirmed cases that are reported to public health authorities,
we can combine these estimates in a sequential manner to
evaluate the extent of undiagnosed disease. These data will be
necessary to evaluate the full extent of morbidity and the costs
attributable to diarrheal diseases.
Data from the present survey are also useful for developing
education programs for providers who treat patients with acute
diarrhea. For example, the data indicate that physicians were
less likely to request a stool culture for patients who are thought
to be part of an outbreak, compared with apparent sporadic
illnesses. Physicians may assume that, once an outbreak has
been recognized, further diagnostic studies are unnecessary, but
this is usually not the case. Such a decision is valid only if the
cause of the outbreak is already known, if more culture-confirmed cases are not needed to identify the food or water vehicle, if public health authorities are notified of the suspected

stool culture would test for E. coli O157:H7 when, in fact, the
laboratory method used would not yield this pathogen [8].
Furthermore, 140% of respondents did not know whether Yersinia or Vibrio species were included in a routine stool culture,
or whether parasites such as Cryptosporidia or Cyclospora species would be detected by a routine O&P examination. Insufficient physician knowledge of which organisms are detected
by routine stool examinationss could have negative consequences for patient care and public health. If a provider incorrectly assumes that a negative stool culture result has excluded infection with an important organism from the
differential diagnosis, treatment and follow-up recommendations may be misguided. Likewise, the opportunity to diagnose
an infection of public health importance may be missed. To
avoid this mistake, providers should be made aware of what
tests a routine examination includes and should insist that such
examinations include the organisms of epidemiologic importance in that area. The CDC recommends that all bloody stools
be cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species
and E. coli O157:H7 [9]. However, not all bacterial diarrhea is
caused by these organisms, and, if another organism is suspected, a specific request usually must be made to include it
in the diagnostic examination. Education programs for health
care providers about the use of the clinical laboratory for diagnosis of acute diarrhea could help to address these concerns.
Although diarrhea is a common complaint among outpatients, surprisingly few data exist to guide an evidence-based
approach to its diagnosis and treatment. The predictive value
of a diagnostic test for stool is dependent on the test’s sensitivity
and specificity, as well as the organism’s prevalence in the population being evaluated. Future investigations could focus on
evaluating these parameters, to provide clinicians with better
information for decision making. Those who apply guidelines
for acute diarrheal disease to their own clinical practice should
consider the various uses of a stool test result, as data for
therapeutic and follow-up plans, as a guide for patient education needs, in providing antimicrobial sensitivity data, and
in meeting the public health needs of notifiable disease surveillance and outbreak detection.

a physician visit [6]. These differing estimates raise the concern
that one or both may be an inaccurate reflection of actual
physician practice. The physician survey is subject to several
factors that may have resulted in an overestimation of the frequency of actual stool-culture practices. First, retrospective selfreported data are subject to recall bias. Physicians may better
recall a recent difficult or interesting case or the last patient
who had a positive culture result. This could have resulted in
a systematic overestimation in the proportion of patients from
whom stool samples were obtained. Second, respondents may
have tried to anticipate that the “correct” answers to the survey
should reflect the practice that stool culturing is desirable. Finally, respondents may have been more interested in diarrheal
diseases than were nonrespondents and, thus, more likely to
request stool cultures for patients with diarrhea. The FoodNet
Working Group is planning a clinic-based follow-up study to
further evaluate the proportion of physicians who request a
stool culture for patients with diarrhea.
Our survey provided an opportunity to evaluate factors that
might account for differences in physician diagnostic practices
for patients with diarrhea. Although we expect that such practices differ according to the patients’ age, health status, and
epidemiologic context, these data also indicate variability
caused by other reasons. For example, the association between
the probability of a stool culture request and the duration of
diarrhea was different depending on the state where the physician practices, even after controlling for specialty, patient
characteristics, or practice type. Furthermore, these differences
did not appear to be due to variation in the rates of diarrhea
or in the rates of care seeking for diarrhea, because these rates
were not different among the 5 FoodNet sites (CDC FoodNet
population survey, unpublished data). These differences in
stool-culture ordering practices are likely due to differences in
practice style or habits that are not explained by specialty, patient characteristics, or practice type. Variability in practice style
may be an indication that an evidence-based approach to the
diagnosis of diarrhea would be of benefit to clinicians, patients,
and public health practitioners. Such a guideline for infectious
diarrhea has been recently published [7].
Our data indicate that physicians often do not know which
pathogens are detected in stool examinations. The vast majority
of physicians reported that a “routine” stool culture included
techniques that would identify Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. This finding was confirmed by a survey of
clinical laboratories in FoodNet catchment areas, which showed
that 99% of laboratories surveyed routinely cultured for these
pathogens in stool specimens (CDC, unpublished data). However, a high proportion of physicians (28%) did not know
whether a routine culture would detect E. coli O157:H7. In a
separate analysis of these data, a high proportion of physicians
(up to 77% in California) mistakenly believed that a routine
