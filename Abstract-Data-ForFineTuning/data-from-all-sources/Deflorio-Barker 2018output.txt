Abstract

Author Manuscript

Swimming and recreating in lakes, oceans, and rivers is common, yet the literature suggests
children may be at greater risk of illness following such exposures. These effects might be due to
differences in immunity or differing behavioral factors such as poorer hygiene, longer exposures
to, and greater ingestion of potentially contaminated water and sand. We pooled data from 12
prospective cohorts (n=68,685) to examine exposures to potentially contaminated media such as
beach water and sand, among children compared to adults, and conducted a simulation using selfreported time spent in the water and volume of water swallowed per minute by age, to estimate the

total volume of water swallowed per swimming event by age category. Children 4–7 and 8–12 had
the highest exposures to water, sand, and algae compared to other age groups. Based on our
simulation, we found that children (6–12) swallow a median of 36mL (90th percentile= 150 mL),
while adults 35 and over swallow 9 mL (90th percentile=64 mL) per swimming event, with male
children swallowing a greater amount of water compared to females. These estimates may help to
reduce uncertainty surrounding routes and durations of recreational exposures and can support the
development of chemical and microbial risk assessments.

Introduction
Surface water recreation in the US is popular among both adults and children (1, 2), but
close to one-third of all beachgoers are under the age of 20 (1). Because of their
underdeveloped immune systems, children are often cited as being more vulnerable to
enteric illnesses from pathogens encountered during such activity (2, 3). In particular,
children age 10 and under are at greater risk of developing gastrointestinal illness compared
to those over age 10 (4).

Author Manuscript

Children are also at greater risk because they spend a greater amount of time in the water
compared to adults (4–6), and thus are more likely to swallow water while at the beach (1, 7,
8). Children are also more likely to participate in splashing behaviors that have been found
to be associated with water ingestion while swimming (9). Swallowing water during
recreation in water contaminated with feces is a risk factor for gastrointestinal illness (4, 10).
Moreover, surface water is often not the only source of fecal contamination at beaches.
Beach sand has also been found to have high concentrations of fecal indicator organisms
(11), yet is not always related to fecal contamination (12–14). However, exposure to beach
sand affected by wastewater effluent, has been positively associated with gastrointestinal
illness (15). Algae, particularly Cladophora algae, has been known to harbor fecal indicator
organisms in some cases in higher concentrations than surrounding surface water (16), as the
algal mat may provide an environment suitable for bacterial growth (17). However, evidence
suggests that the fecal indicator organisms growing within the algal mat may (18) or may not
(19) be related to human sources. Nonetheless, young children are more likely to play and
have direct contact with sand, and possibly algae, compared to adults (1).

Author Manuscript

One key component of quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA), which are used to
compare and assess the risk of illness due to exposures to recreational waters (20, 21), is the
route and duration of exposure (22). In such studies, the volume of water ingested is a
critical parameter required to estimate the risk of infection or illness due to enteric pathogen
exposure in recreational water. Previous QMRAs have relied on a range of estimates for
volumes swallowed (23–26), but little emphasis has been placed on estimating risk based on
the differences in volume of recreational water swallowed according to age. Compared to
adults, children often exhibit different exposure patterns due to their small physical size and

differences in behavior (27). Evaluating exposures among different age groups of beach
goers, especially the total volume of water swallowed, may be useful to characterize risk and
inform QMRAs.
Our objective was to estimate exposure to water, sand and algae among different age groups
recreating at US beaches by using a pooled analysis of 12 prospective cohorts of beachgoers
in the contiguous United States (n=68,685). These studies used similar designs, and
methodology, allowing the data to be combined into a single data set (2, 7, 28–33), as has
been described by Arnold et al. (2016) (4).

Materials and Methods
Study Settings

Author Manuscript

All 12 cohorts were enrolled between 2003 and 2009 at temperate beaches within the
contiguous United States, and have been previously described (4) (Figure 1). Four of these
studies were at freshwater beaches (n=21,015) and 8 at marine beaches (n=47,670) (4).
Because the focus of this study was on beaches in temperate climates, one site (Boqueron
Beach in Puerto Rico) included in Arnold et al (2016) was excluded from this analysis due
to the tropical setting.

Author Manuscript

Eligible household members attending the beach who provided informed consent were
enrolled between May and September during the study years. Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approval was obtained from the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and the University of California, Berkeley. Enrolled
beachgoers participated in a short survey as they left the beach for the day to assess
exposures while at the beach. Children (under 18) were eligible when accompanied by an
adult (18 years or older) while at the beach. Unaccompanied children were ineligible to
participate. One adult (18 years or older) responded to exposure questions for the rest of the
household. Details regarding recruitment and survey administration have been described
previously (4).
Swimming and other Exposures

Author Manuscript

In this analysis, we focused on participant responses to survey questions regarding various
exposures and behaviors while at the beach. Participants were asked about water exposures;
if they had any contact (wading, swimming, or playing) with water, if they had body contact
with the water (body was immersed in the water), if their head or face was submerged in the
water, if they got any water in their mouth, and if they swallowed any water. Participants
were also asked to estimate, in minutes, the total time they spent in the water. All
participants were also asked if they dug into the sand or were buried in the sand, but
additional details collected about sand exposure varied by beach. At marine beaches
(Avalon, Doheny, Edgewater, Fairhope, Goddard, Malibu, and Surfside) participants were
asked if they ingested any sand, whether the sand they played with was wet or dry, and if
they washed their hands following sand contact. Participants at Fairhope, Goddard, and
Surfside beaches were asked if they ate or drank following digging or playing in the sand.
All participants were asked if they played with any algae or seaweed, while participants at

Avalon, Doheny, Malibu, and Surfside beaches were asked if they washed their hands after
playing with algae or seaweed, and participants at Avalon, Doheny, Fairhope, Goddard,
Malibu, and Surfside locations were asked if they got any algae or seaweed in their mouth.

Author Manuscript

We summarized beachgoer demographics, behaviors and exposures by age group and water
type (freshwater and marine). We assessed exposure across the following age categories:
children ≤1, ages 1–3, 4–7, 8–12, and 13–18; and adults 19–34, and ≥ 35. For the purposes
of this analysis, we consider children to be 18 years or less, while adults are 19 and over.
Due to the large data set, several age categories for those 18 and under were chosen to
observe any potential exposure patterns among children at the beach. Since we did not
anticipate any behavioral differences among adults 35 years and older, we included them as
one age category. We also compared the total number of minutes spent in the water
according to age group among subjects with body immersion using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Participants were asked to self-report their estimated total number of hours and minutes
spent in the water, and not the total time spent at the beach. Self-reported swimming ≥10
hours were excluded (n=15) as possible errors, and those who swam but reported 0 minutes
were recoded as 1 minute (n=16).
Simulation

Author Manuscript

Self-reported estimates of time spent in the water were combined with estimates provided by
Dufour et al. (2017) (n=553) of the volume of water swallowed during 45–90 minutes of
swimming. Dufour et al., measured the amount of cyanuric acid found in the urine of
participants who to performed “normal swimming activities” in a treated swimming pool
and recorded the time spent in the water, age and sex of the participants, which we used to
provide an estimate of the rate of water swallowed per minute for those age 6 and older.
Data for the 68,685 beachgoers from the 12 locations were used to develop estimates of total
minutes spent in the water among those who had body contact with the water (n=35,176).
Using bootstrap sampling with replacement from the original data set, we conducted a
simulation study according to the following algorithm to integrate these two data sources.

This simulation was conducted for each age group using all participants, and for males and
females separately, since evidence suggests males may swallow a greater volume compared
to females (26, 34, 36–38). The simulation was also conducted separately based on beach
water type (freshwater and marine), since behavior was expected to differ at different types
of beaches (1). Also, to be consistent with age categories presented in the US EPA Exposure
Factors Handbook (5, 6, 27) and other US EPA documentation (39), we chose to also assess
the simulation for the following age categories; 6–10, 11–17, and 18 and over. In addition, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted by restricting the time spent in the water at the beach to
only those who reported head immersion, since head immersion behavior may more closely
represent the behavior among participants in the Dufour et al. (2017) and Evans et al. (2006)
study. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 13 (40) and R version
3.2.1. (41). Statistical code available upon request.

Results
Beachgoer Characteristics
A total of 68,685 beachgoers participated in the 12 studies (Table 1), approximately 26%
(n=17,801) of whom were under the age of 13. The majority of beachgoers at freshwater
(84.2%) and marine (67.8%) beaches were white, and most beachgoers at these locations
were non-Hispanic, 90.7% and 76.6%, respectively.
Beach Exposures

Overall, we observed that 67% of both freshwater and marine (Table 2) participants waded,
swam, or played in the water (any water contact). In both fresh and marine waters children
swam more frequently than adults. At all beach locations, approximately 90% of children
aged 4–7 and those aged 8–12 waded, swam, or played in the water, compared to about 56%
of adults aged 35 and older. In freshwater, 72% of children aged 8–12 immersed their head
or face in the water, compared to approximately 19% of adults. Similarly, in marine water,
71% of children aged 8–12 immersed their head or face in the water, compared to 29% of
adults over the age of 35. Among freshwater participants, 25% of children aged 1–3, 24% of
children aged 4–7, and 20% of children aged 8–12 swallowed water while swimming,
compared to only 2% of adults 35 and over. Twenty-two percent of children aged 1–3, 27%
of children aged 4–7, and 28% of children aged 8–12 in marine waters swallowed water,
compared to only 7% of adults. All types of water exposures were lower among children
under 1 year of age, and gradually increased to age 12, with the highest exposures mostly
among children aged 8–12, and then declining in older age groups. The lowest exposures
were consistently among adults aged 35 and over. Males and females were observed to have
similar behaviors while at the beach (Supplement Table S1 and Table S2).
Total time spent in the water varied by age (Kruskal-Wallis p-value <0.001) (Table 3), with
children 8–12 at freshwater locations spending a mean of 93 minutes (SD=65 minutes) per
event in the water compared to adults 35 and over, who spent a mean of 47 minutes (SD= 46
minutes). Children 8–12 at marine locations spent a mean of 121 minutes (SD=85 minutes)

in the water compared to adults 35 and over, who spent a mean of 68 minutes (SD= 64
minutes). Those recreating in marine waters, typically spent more time in the water
compared to freshwater swimmers (Freshwater: mean=63.7 minutes, Marine: mean=86.4
minutes, p-value >0.001) (Figure 2, Table 3). Males on average, spent a greater amount of
time in the water compared to females (Males: mean=83.7 minutes, Females: mean=75.4
minutes, p-value >0.001) (Figure 2, Table 3). Data from Dufour et al (2017) and Evans et al
(2006) show that children under age 18 swallow water at a faster rate compared to adults
(Figure 3). Across almost all age groups, male participants in the Dufour et al. study
swallow water at a faster rate compared to females in the same age group.

The simulation estimated the total volume swallowed per event. Overall, we estimated that
children swallowed more water per swimming event compared to adults 19 and older
(Figure 4a–b, Table 4). Children, aged 6–12 swallowed a median of 36.0 mL (90Th
percentile=150.0 mL), compared to adults 35 and older who swallowed a median of 9.0 mL
(90th percentile=64.0 mL). We also observed differences in volumes swallowed per event
based on sex (Figure 4a, Table 4). Based on this analysis, we estimated that females ages 6–
12 swallowed a median of 34.3 mL (90th percentile=146.1 mL) per swimming event and
females ages 13–18 swallowed median of 17.3 mL (90th percentile=97.0 mL), while females
35 and over swallow a median of 6.6 mL (90th percentile=44.3 mL). However, males 6–12
swallowed a median of 40.0 mL (90th percentile=161.0 mL) per swimming event and males
13–18 swallowed a median 34.7 mL (90th percentile=200.0 mL) per swimming event, while
males 35 and over swallowed a median of 13.3 mL (90th percentile=104.0 mL). These
differences in volume of water swallowed according to sex, results from a combination of
both the Dufour et al. (2017) data which observed males swallowing water at a higher rate
(per minute), and from our data which indicate males spend a greater amount of time in the
water compared to females (Table 3, Figure 2). Additionally, those recreating in marine
water, tended to swallow more water compared to freshwater recreators (Figure 4b, Table 4),
with all marine recreators swallowing a median of 18.0 mL (90th percentile=116.0 mL) and
freshwater recreators swallowing a median of 12.7 mL (90th percentile=84.0 mL). Similar
age differences were also noted between marine versus freshwater recreators.
The sensitivity analysis results, which only included times for those reporting head
immersion, were similar to the simulation that included those with body contact. Overall,
children aged 6–12 with head immersion swallowed a median of 42.7 mL (mean= 72.0 mL,
90th percentile=172.0 mL), while adults 35 and over were estimated to swallowed a median
of 13.0 mL (mean= 41.1 mL, 90th percentile=88.0 mL) (Supplement Table S3).

Author Manuscript

To be consistent with age categories presented in the US EPA Exposure Factors Handbook
(5, 6, 27) and other US EPA documentation (39), estimated exposure for the following age
categories; 6–10, 11–17, and 18 and over. Overall, children aged 6–10 (median= 40.0, 90th
percentile=164.0) and children aged 11–17 (median=32.0, 90th percentile= 170.7)
swallowed more water than those aged 18 and over (median=9.3, 90th percentile=64.0)
(Supplement Figure S1, Table S4). Similar patterns were observed among males versus
females and marine versus freshwater recreators as were observed with the narrower age
categories (Supplement Figure S1, Table S4).

Beach sand and algae contact

Author Manuscript

Contact with beach sand was relatively common, with almost 44% of freshwater participants
and 36% of marine participants (Table 5) indicating playing in or digging in the sand. At
freshwater locations approximately 88% of children aged 4–7 reported digging or playing in
sand, compared to 27% of adults 35 and over. At marine locations, 76% of children aged 4–
7 reported digging in the sand compared to only 22% of adults over the age of 35.

Author Manuscript

In freshwater, 4% of children aged 4–7 and 5% of children aged 8–12 touched or had contact
with algae or seaweed, compared with only 1% of adults 19 and older (Table 5). At marine
beaches, 20% of children aged 4–7 and 18% of children 8–12 touched or had contact with
algae or seaweed, compared to 8% of adults aged 19–34 and 7% of adults aged 35 and older
(Table 5). Among participants at the marine beaches, 4% of children under 1 and 2% of
children 1–12 reported getting seaweed or algae in their mouths, compared to less than 1%
of those aged 35 and older.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this analysis, based on the largest assembled data set of recreational water exposure, we
provided improved estimates of the volumes of water swallowed among beachgoers for a
wide range of age groups. Based on the results of our simulation, we found that children
tend to swallow more water per swimming event, and males swallow more water compared
to females (Table 4, Figure 4a). This finding is a result of the fact that males were observed
to swallow a greater volume of water in the Dufour et al. (2017) (Figure 3) study and that
males spent more time in the water compared to females (Figure 2, Table 3). We also
observed that marine water recreators swallow more water compared to freshwater
recreators (Table 4, Figure 4b). This may be because marine recreators spent more time in
the water compared to freshwater recreators (Figure 2b, Table 3), which may have been
influenced by the warmer water at most of the marine sites (California and Gulf Coast)
compared to the freshwater sites in the Great Lakes. We also found across the beaches
studied that children have more exposure to sand and algae than adults--another potential
route of exposure to fecal contamination. Using the same data, Arnold et al (2016) found
significantly higher risk of diarrhea and gastrointestinal illness among young children (age
0–4 and 5–10) compared with adults (4). Our exposure estimates (Table 2) are consistent
with the findings by Arnold et al. (2016), and the present effort to summarize exposure
across a broad range of age, sex, and beach categories provides valuable additional
information for future studies.

Author Manuscript

The results of the simulation, using self-reported time spent in the water (n=68,685) and
estimated volume of water swallowed per minute (34), present a refined estimate of the
volume of water swallowed per swimming event and decrease the uncertainty associated
with recreational water ingestion estimates, especially among children, compared to
previous studies. Other studies that have estimated the volume of water swallowed per
swimming event, included subjective parameters, such as self-reported ordinal estimates of
the volume of water swallowed (8, 42, 43), which may potentially be problematic as
estimating the volume of water swallowed may be subjective and vary from person to
person. In addition, the WHO guidelines for recreational water assume individuals swallow

between 20–50 mL of water per hour of swimming and suggests that swimmers could
swallow between 100–200 mL in a single swimming event. The WHO also indicates that
this estimate could be larger for other types of water activities such as water skiing (44). In
our analysis we found that children (6–12) swallow a median of 40 mL (75th percentile= 87
mL), while adults 35 and over swallow 10 mL (75th percentile=31 mL) per swimming event.

Author Manuscript

The simulation relied on several assumptions to estimate the total volume of water
swallowed per swimming event. In this analysis, we assumed there is a linear relationship
between the volume of water swallowed and total time spent in the water, and thus more
time spent in the water suggests a greater volume of water swallowed. Therefore, the volume
of water swallowed per unit time was multiplied by the total time in the water to yield the
total volume of swallowed per swimming event. This approach has been used previously in
QMRA studies to estimate the total volume swallowed based on exposure times and the
volume of water swallowed per minute (25). In addition, the US EPA Exposure Factors
Handbook (5, 27) and the Child-Specific Exposure Factors Handbook (27) provide values
for the volume ingested per hour of swimming and the total number of hours swimming to
yield total volume ingested per event. This approach has also been used to assess risk of
ingested recreational surface water (39).

Author Manuscript

The analysis of exposures to sand and algae at the beach indicate that sand exposure is
relatively common among beachgoers (Table 5), but occurs much more frequently among
children, who are more likely to exhibit hand-to-mouth behavior (27). Previous analyses
have indicated that beach sand can harbor fecal indicator bacteria (11), but that it is not
necessarily always related to fecal contamination (12–14). However, sand exposure may be a
potentially important pathway for ingestion of harmful pathogens (15) among children
particularly at beaches affected by wastewater effluent. Algae exposure was less common
compared to sand exposure, but occurred commonly among children under 12. Since certain
types of algae have been known to harbor potentially more fecal indicator bacteria compared
to surrounding recreational water (16), algae exposure may be another important pathway
for children’s exposure to pathogens associated with fecal contamination, since algae may
(18) or may not (19) harbor harmful organisms.

Author Manuscript

This study relied on self-reported data of swimming and beach exposures and time spent in
the water, which may be subject to recall bias. Study participants are also likely to have
rounded their estimate of the amount of time spent in the water, which could have
contributed some misclassification to the actual time spent swimming. In addition, parents/
guardians were often responsible for answering survey questions on behalf of their young
children. Despite the fact that the children were often present during follow-up and could
also answer questions about their own exposure, it may be difficult for parents to be able to
assess certain exposures, such as getting water in the mouth or swallowing water. Therefore,
we could have underestimated or overestimated exposure among young children, if parents/
guardians were unaware of these types of specific exposures.
Previously, children ≤ 6 have been identified to be at the highest risk of gastrointestinal
illness due to exposure to recreational water (4). However, in our simulation, analysis of
volume ingested per swimming event could only be assessed for those ≥ 6, since the Dufour

et al (2017) and Evans et al (2006) studies only assessed volume swallowed per minute in
participants ≥ 6. In addition, we conducted our simulation including all those who had any
contact with the water, and again including only those who immersed their head in the water.
Overall, our findings were very similar (children 6–12 full dataset: median=36.0,
mean=63.2; children 6–12 head immersion only: median=42.7, mean=72.0), indicating
consistency across the analysis.

Author Manuscript

This analysis aimed to assess exposures at the beach among adults and children and to
estimate the total volume of water swallowed among beachgoers. Our findings indicate that
children are more likely to engage in activities associated with greater exposure, such as
spending more time in the water and having more contact with algae and sand compared to
adults. The results of our bootstrap simulation suggest children, especially those aged 6–12,
swallow a greater amount of water compared to adults over 35, and that male children
swallow a greater amount of water compared to females. Given the previous observation by
Arnold et al (2016) that more children are more likely to become ill following swimming in
recreational water compared to adults, the results presented here suggest that behaviors
among children may potentially put them at higher risk of becoming ill following swimming
at beaches. In addition, by integrating the amount of time spent in the water with the rate of
swallowing water, we were able to identify a significantly increased water ingestion rate
among males, with male children potentially the highest exposed group based on volume of
water swallowed per event. Therefore, future QMRA studies should consider these
differences in exposure among adults and children when estimating risk among surface
water recreators.
