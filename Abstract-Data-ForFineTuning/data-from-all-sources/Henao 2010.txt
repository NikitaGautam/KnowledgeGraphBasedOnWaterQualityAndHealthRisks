Abstract

Foodborne illnesses are a substantial health burden in the United States. The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) is the principal foodborne disease component of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s Emerging Infections Program. FoodNet is a collaborative project among Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Emerging Infections Program sites, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. One of FoodNet’s main objectives is to monitor changes in the incidence of
selected foodborne pathogens. In 1996, FoodNet began active, population-based surveillance for laboratorydiagnosed cases of Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella, Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157, Shigella, Vibrio, and
Yersinia infection. Surveillance for cases of Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora infection was added in 1997 and
surveillance for non-O157 Shiga toxin–producing E. coli was added in 2000. From 1997 to 2008, the FoodNet
surveillance population increased, primarily through the addition of new sites. The increase in the number
of FoodNet sites and the size of the population under surveillance as well as the variation in the incidence
of infections among sites posed challenges in the selection of the most appropriate method to monitor changes
in incidence. To account for variation introduced by changes in population size, a main-effects, log-linear Poisson
(negative binomial) regression model was adopted to estimate the magnitude of changes in the incidence of
pathogens by comparing current year incidence to reference periods. The article explains how FoodNet uses the
negative binomial model to examine changes in incidence over time, describes the reference periods used, explains
the graphics used to display results, and discusses future directions in the analysis of trends over time.

Introduction

F

oodborne infections are an important public health
problem in the United States (Mead et al., 1999). While
advances in technology, regulation, and education over the
past century have improved the safety of our food supply,
growth of mass production, distribution, and importation of
food continues to create new challenges (Allos et al., 2004). To
monitor the effectiveness of control efforts, measuring change
over time is essential.
The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network
(FoodNet), an active, population-based sentinel surveillance
system, has made a major contribution to efforts to improve
food safety in the United States. FoodNet provides regulatory
agencies, industry, consumer groups, and public health personnel with more precise information on the burden and
trends in foodborne diseases than was previously available.
Each year, FoodNet provides the most up-to-date information

available on trends in selected foodborne diseases. These data
are used to prioritize and evaluate food safety interventions
and to monitor progress toward national health objectives
(Scallan, 2007).
When established in 1996, the FoodNet surveillance area
included five sites with a population of 14.3 million persons.
From 1996 to 2004, counties and states were added to the
surveillance area, and the population under surveillance tripled, to 46.0 million persons in 10 sites in 2008. The expansion
of the FoodNet surveillance area and the variation in incidence among FoodNet areas that joined the surveillance
system at different times, presented epidemiologic and statistical challenges in the evaluation of trends. To account for
variation introduced by changes in population size, in 2001, a
main-effects, log-linear Poisson (negative binomial) regression model was adopted to estimate the magnitude of changes
in the incidence of pathogens by comparing current year
incidence with a reference period. This article explains the

reasons for selecting this model, describes implementation,
compares the use of different reference periods, describes the
graphics selected to display results, and discusses potential
future directions in the analysis of trends.
FoodNet and Active Surveillance
FoodNet is a collaborative program that includes the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and selected state
health departments in Emerging Infection Program sites
( Jones et al., 2007). Monitoring trends in the burden of certain
foodborne illnesses in the United States over time is one of
FoodNet’s primary objectives; the others are to determine the
burden of foodborne illness, to attribute that burden to specific
foods and settings, and to disseminate information that can be
used to develop interventions to reduce the burden of foodborne illness. FoodNet data are also used to monitor progress
toward national Healthy People objectives. (Scallan, 2007).
When established in 1996, FoodNet included the states of
Minnesota and Oregon as well as selected counties in California (Alameda and San Francisco), Connecticut (Hartford
and New Haven), and Georgia (Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb,
Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Newton, and Rockdale). From
1997 to 2004, the FoodNet surveillance area expanded several
times to ultimately include the entire states of Connecticut,
Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, and
Tennessee, as well as selected counties in California, Colorado, and New York (Table 1).
FoodNet conducts population-based active surveillance for
laboratory-confirmed infections caused by seven bacterial
pathogens (Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella,
Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157 [since 2000, other Shiga
toxin–producing E. coli serogroups], Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia species other than Y. pestis) and two parasitic pathogens
(Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium, for which surveillance started in 1997). Surveillance is conducted in collaboration with
the more than 650 clinical laboratories serving the population
under surveillance using standard case definitions and comparable data collection methods. FoodNet personnel at each
site actively contact all of these clinical laboratories regularly
to ascertain laboratory-confirmed cases (Hardnett et al., 2004).
For each case of infection with one of the pathogens monitored, we collect information including the date of onset of
illness, the state and county where the patient with the
reported infection resides, age of the patient, whether the
patient traveled in the 7 days before onset of symptoms, and
whether the case was outbreak associated.
Modeling Trends over Time
Before 2001, only data from the original 5 FoodNet surveillance sites were used in the evaluation of trends, thus not
making full use of FoodNet data. In 2001, we began to use a
negative binomial regression model to evaluate trends, because this model allows the use of all data from all sites and
can account for changes in the surveillance area. That said, the
increase in population under surveillance with respect to time
implies that rates for earlier time periods are estimated with
less precision than for later periods. We considered using a
Poisson regression model, also known as a log-linear model, a
type of analysis that has traditionally been used to model rate

HENAO ET AL.
data (Frome, 1983). Poisson regression is an optimal approach
when there is no overdispersion of the data and when there
are no excess zeros in the data. However, state-to-state and
county-to-county variations in incidence in FoodNet produce
both overdispersion and excess zeros in the surveillance
data—that is, to varying degrees, clustering of cases in time
and space is characteristic of FoodNet data. A negative binomial model is an extension of the Poisson regression model
that accommodates this type of variation (Pedan, 2001). Thus,
it explicitly controls for site-to-site incidence variation while
estimating changes in incidence.
Using the negative binomial model, each year we estimate
the change in incidence between the most recent year and the
reference period of interest. Figure 1 is an example of the SAS
(v.9.2, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) code used to run the model.
First, we create a dataset aggregated by pathogen (‘‘PATHOGEN,’’ in Fig. 1), year the infection occurred (‘‘YEAR’’), and year
in which each county or state entered FoodNet (‘‘STATE_
ENTYEAR’’). For each combination of these variables, we sum
the number of cases of infections reported (‘‘COUNT’’), determine the corresponding population based on U.S. Census
population estimates, and calculate the log of the population
estimate (‘‘LOGPOPULATION’’). Using the PROC GENMOD
procedure in SAS we fit the negative binomial regression model
to this dataset. We specify the distribution of the ‘‘COUNT’’ as
negative binomial, and the ‘‘link’’ function as ‘‘log.’’ The natural
log of the mean of the negative binomial distributed dependent
variable is defined by a linear combination of two predictor
variables; changes in incidence are measured by the effect of
‘‘YEAR’’ while ‘‘STATE_ENTYEAR,’’ as defined above, controls for changes in surveillance area and site-to-site variation in
incidence. A set of estimate statements are used to create the
different reference periods of interest.
Reference Periods
Selection of the most appropriate reference period for
examination of trends in FoodNet data is challenging, both
because of the growth of FoodNet and because the best
baseline against which to measure future changes varies
depending on what is being assessed. We have used several
reference periods. From the introduction of the negative
binomial model in 2001 through 2004, we used the first year of
FoodNet surveillance (1996) as the reference period (CDC
2001, 2002, 2003, 2004; Scallan, 2007). In 2005, to better account
for fluctuations in reported incidence rates in FoodNet’s first
years, we started using the used the average annual incidence
from the first 3 years (2 years for Cryptosporidium) of surveillance as the reference period (CDC, 2005). In 2007, we introduced an additional reference period—the average annual
incidence for the 3 years preceding the year of interest (CDC,
2007).
Using the comparison periods, we report the estimated
change in incidence for the most recent year of data using a
relative rate (RR) and a 95% confidence interval. Percent
change in incidence and corresponding confidence intervals
are calculated by subtracting 1 from the RRs and confidence
intervals and multiplying by 100. To display the information
we use two graphing schemes (described in the next section).
As an example, Table 2 shows the RRs and percent changes
for 2008 for each of three reference periods: (1) 1996 (the
first year of surveillance), (2) 1996–1998 (the first 3 years of

surveillance), and (3) 2005–2007 (the 3 years immediately
preceding the year of the report). As illustrated by the tighter
confidence intervals in Table 2, the use of 1996–1998 as the
reference period provides for a more precise estimate of the
reference rate and thus results in more stable RR estimates
than 1996 alone. Using the 3 years preceding the year of the
report as an additional reference period provides a way to
examine recent changes in incidence; as FoodNet surveillance
moves into its second decade, the ability to make formal
comparisons to a period more recent than the start of surveillance becomes increasingly important.
Graphical Presentation of Trends over Time
Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the RRs of infection
with five pathogens under FoodNet surveillance from the start
of FoodNet through 2008, as compared with the 1996–1998
reference period. It includes the four pathogens with a Healthy
People 2010 objective as well as Vibrio. Years are on the X-axis,

and RRs are on the Y-axis on a logarithmic scale. A reference
line is displayed at RR ¼ 1 to allow the reader to easily discern
the direction of change for any year, as compared with the
1996–1998 period. Points above the reference line indicate
increases in incidence; points below indicate decreases. This
graph does not indicate whether incidence changes were statistically significant. This graphic allows easy comparison of
multiple years and pathogens. For example, for Campylobacter
infection, after an initial decline in the early years of FoodNet
surveillance, the RR since 2001 has changed little. In contrast,
rates of Vibrio infection in FoodNet were lower than in the
reference period until 2001 but have since been higher.
Figure 3 provides a graphic display of rate comparisons
using the more recent reference period; it displays the percent
change in a given year (in this case 2008) compared with
the average annual incidence over the preceding 3 years. Pathogens are displayed on the X-axis and percent changes on
the Y-axis. A reference line is displayed at percent change ¼ 0.
In contrast to Fig. 2, this graphic also displays confidence

intervals for the estimates of change, allowing the reader to
easily ascertain if the change in recent incidence is statistically
significant. In this example, only the change in Salmonella incidence is significant.
Discussion
We have presented the rationale and methods for the approaches currently used to evaluate and report trends in
FoodNet surveillance data, the reference periods used for
comparison with current surveillance data, and the graphs

used to display these results. This detailed exposition of these
methods complements FoodNet’s annual presentation of
current data on the incidence of several important infections
transmitted commonly through food. Understanding these
methods may be useful to stakeholders, including public
health and food regulatory authorities, consumer advocacy
organizations, the food industry, and others.
To evaluate trends, we selected the negative binomial
model, an extension of Poisson regression that allows for
the overdispersion and excess zeroes seen in FoodNet data.
This model is straightforward to use, its results are readily

interpretable, and it adequately accounts for the changing
FoodNet surveillance area and the variation in incidence both
from site to site and within sites. The model implicitly assumes
that the disease process, as described by the main effects of
year and location, is valid for those combinations of year and
state that were not observed. We have validated this assumption to the extent that subset analysis of the data allows.
For some of the lower incidence pathogens with little variation
in incidence by site—Listeria is a good example—both the basic
log-linear Poisson model and the negative binomial Poisson
model fit well. However, the negative binomial model is
preferable, because it provides greater flexibility than the basic
log-linear Poisson model for dealing with overdispersion and
excess zeroes that could occur (Pedan, 2001). We changed from
a single year to a 3-year baseline reference period because this
baseline led to more stable and precise RR estimates (CDC,
2005). The estimates obtained in the regression procedure for
each pathogen are based on the counts for each site by year,
meaning that, as new data are accrued, the estimates of effect
for both site and year are modified. The accrual of new data
changes the estimates of both current and historical year
effects and, therefore, the associated RRs that are reported.
However, sufficient data have now been accrued that these
fluctuations are trivial. To allow formal comparisons to a recent time period, we added a comparison with the 3 years
immediately preceding the year of the report.
We plan to continue exploring descriptions of the
FoodNet data based on the negative binomial model and to
incorporate useful explorations into future reports. We also
continue to explore other methods to supplement our analyses, such as joinpoint regression analysis (http:==srab.cancer
.gov=joinpoint). Examples of future analyses include the
evaluation of trends by age group to determine whether, as
has been reported elsewhere, different trends are at play in
different segments of the population (Gillespie et al., 2009).
Similarly, analysis of trends in travel- and outbreak- related
cases might provide additional insight relevant to prevention
efforts. Expansion of modeling approaches to adjust for seasonality may allow increased precision of estimates of trends.
We will also explore the use of smooth predictors based on
time, in addition to the discrete predictors that we currently
use, to summarize longer-term patterns of disease incidence.
Conclusion
FoodNet conducts active population-based surveillance for
infections commonly transmitted through food and provides unique and timely data on the incidence of and trends in
these infections, important information to support decision
making regarding food safety. Substantial expansion of the
FoodNet surveillance area over time has presented challenges
in monitoring changes in incidence over time. This report
explains FoodNet’s current methods for evaluating and reporting trends and the rationale for choosing those methods.
We use a negative binomial model and two comparison periods, one more distant and the other more recent, to evaluate
trends in the incidence of infection with pathogens under
surveillance in FoodNet. Using both comparison periods
provides a more comprehensive picture of changes in incidence of infections with the pathogens of interest than either
comparison period alone.
