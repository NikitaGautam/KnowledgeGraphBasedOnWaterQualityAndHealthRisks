Microbial measures of water quality are predictors of gastrointestinal illness among swimmers in some
settings but not in others. Little is known whether water quality measures predict illness among people
who engage in popular water recreation activities such as paddling, rowing, ﬁshing, or boating (“incidental contact water recreation”). We sought to evaluate indicator microbes, protozoan pathogens, and
turbidity as predictors of gastrointestinal illness following incidental contact water recreation. A cohort
study of incidental contact water recreation was conducted in the Chicago, USA area. Recreation took
place on inland lakes, rivers, Lake Michigan, and an urban waterway heavily impacted by wastewater
efﬂuent. Water samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli, enterococci, somatic coliphages, Fþ coliphages, Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. (oo)cysts, and for turbidity. Median enterococci concentrations were 71.0 and 199.8 colony forming units/100 mL at general use and efﬂuent-dominated
waters, respectively. Among 4694 study participants with complete covariate data, 193 (4.1%) developed gastrointestinal illness within three days of water recreation. In multivariable logistic regression
analysis, water quality metrics did not predict gastrointestinal illness among water recreators. Several
variables other than water quality were associated acute gastrointestinal illness. The odds of such illness
was increased by approximately two-fold by the presence of a chronic gastrointestinal condition, water
exposure to the face, and by approximately 50% among those who ﬁshed (as opposed to other incidental
contact activities). The odds of illness were reduced by approximately 50% among individuals who
frequently used a water body for recreation. Unlike studies of swimmers at wastewater-impacted beaches that observed associations between water quality and illness incidence, this study did not. Public
health protections for incidental contact recreation might focus on reducing exposure, particularly
among ﬁshers, those with chronic gastrointestinal conditions, and new recreators.

1. Introduction
Epidemiologic studies of water recreation have consistently
found that swimmers develop gastrointestinal illness more
frequently than non-swimmers at freshwater (Wade et al., 2008,
2006), marine (Arnold et al., 2013; Colford et al., 2007; Wade
et al., 2010) and riverine (Ferley et al., 1989) beaches. Controlled
exposure studies, in which participants were randomly assigned to
either remain on the beach (avoiding water contact) or to perform
head immersion in beach water, have also consistently found that

water-exposed individuals are more likely to develop gastrointestinal illness than the unexposed (Fleisher et al., 2010; Kay et al.,
1994; Wiedenmann et al., 2006).
Less consistent are ﬁndings of studies that have used microbial
measures of water quality to predict the occurrence of illness. For
example, at two California beaches, swimmers were more likely
than non-swimmers to develop illness, but among swimmers,
densities of fecal indicator bacteria measured by culture or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were not predictive of
gastrointestinal illness occurrence (Arnold et al., 2013; Colford
et al., 2007). Likewise, a controlled exposure study set in Florida
found that water-exposed individuals were more likely to develop
illness than unexposed individuals (Fleisher et al., 2010), though
within the water-exposed group, no association was observed

between gastrointestinal symptoms and enterococci (measured by
culture and qPCR) or Bacteroidales (measured by qPCR)
(Sinigalliano et al., 2010).
Studies of the health risks of swimming have utilized “fecal
indicator bacteria” (FIB), microbes that indicate the presence of
fecal contamination, including Escherichia coli and/or enterococci,
as predictors of illness. Although pathogens e microbes that cause
illness in humans e can be measured in surface water, few epidemiologic studies of water recreation have included pathogen
measurements, in part because they are difﬁcult and costly to
perform. Adenovirus, enterovirus, and norovirus were evaluated as
predictors of illness among swimmers at Mission Bay, CA (Colford
et al., 2007), though pathogen detection was infrequent and not
predictive of illness. Coliphages, viruses that infect E. coli, have
shown some promise as predictors of illness among individuals
randomized to water exposure (head immersion) in inland waters
(Wiedenmann et al., 2006), among swimmers in relatively clean
marine water (Colford et al., 2007), and among users of a whitewater slalom course fed in part by treated wastewater (Lee et al.,
1997).
Epidemiologic studies that evaluated water quality as a predictor of short-term health risks following water recreation have
generally addressed swimming (or “full contact water recreation”),
while only a few relatively small studies have addressed incidental
contact water recreation, such as canoeing, kayaking, ﬁshing,
rowing, or boating (Fewtrell et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1997). As a result,
while incidental contact water recreation is popular and takes place
on some waters where swimming is prohibited, water quality
standards that safely support such recreation have yet to be
established nationally in the US. We previously reported that in the
Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and Recreation Study
(CHEERS), users of Chicago area surface waters for incidental contact water recreation activities were at risk for developing acute
gastrointestinal illness (AGI). Participants used either the engineered Chicago Area Waterways System, which includes the Chicago River and is predominantly treated, but non-disinfected
wastewater efﬂuent, or general use waters that could support fullcontact water recreation. The risk of AGI attributable to incidental
contact recreation was 13.7 (95% conﬁdence interval 3.1, 27.4) and
15.1 (2.6, 25.7) per 1000 uses at efﬂuent dominated and general use
locations, respectively (Dorevitch et al., 2012b). The primary
objective of the present study is to evaluate microbial measures of
water quality, including coliphages and the protozoan pathogens
Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., as predictors of gastrointestinal illness occurrence among incidental contact water
recreators.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Overview
Prior publications provide details about the setting, short-term
health risks of incidental contact water recreation (Dorevitch
et al., 2012b), estimated volume of water swallowed during water
recreation (Dorevitch et al., 2011b), pathogens detected in stool
samples from CHEERS participants who developed gastrointestinal
symptoms (Dorevitch et al., 2012a), and measures of viral (Aslan
et al., 2011) and protozoan (Dorevitch et al., 2011a) pathogens in
the waters studied. Brieﬂy, incidental contact water recreators as
well as individuals who engaged in non-water recreation (such as
jogging, cycling, walking, and team sports) were recruited at boat
launches, harbors, piers, and beaches in the Chicago area. Data
collection methods, including survey instruments, were based on
the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Environmental
and Epidemiologic Assessment of Recreational water (NEEAR)

95

study (Wade et al., 2008, 2006, 2010). Participants underwent a
pre-recreation interview to establish eligibility, and a postrecreation interview to evaluate water exposure during recreation
as well as other risk factors for illness. Water exposure was assessed
by asking participants a series of questions about swallowing water
as well as head/face, and trunk exposure. Ordinal response options
included none, a few drops, splashed, drenched, or submerged.
These response options were validated as being associated with
varying degrees of water exposure using a chemical tracer in a
swimming pool (Dorevitch et al., 2011b). Participants were interviewed by telephone on approximately days 2, 5, and 21 postrecreation to evaluate the occurrence of symptoms. For their time
and effort participants received a T-shirt and a $15 gift card upon
completion of the post-recreation interview (in the ﬁeld). At the
completion of telephone follow-up each was sent a check for $35.
Follow-up data were available from 11,297 individuals, or 94.5% of
the 11,733 who completed the ﬁeld interviews and did not have
gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline. In the present analysis, we
focus on the 7710 study participants who engaged in incidental
contact water recreation on either the efﬂuent-dominated or the
general use waters.
Deﬁnition of illness: AGI was deﬁned as the occurrence of 1) any
vomiting and/or 2) at least three loose stools in a 24 h period, and/
or 3) nausea or stomachache that interfere with daily activity, or 4)
nausea with stomach ache, consistent with the NEEAR deﬁnition of
AGI (Wade et al., 2008, 2006, 2010). Based on KaplaneMeier
analysis of illness onset among CHEERS participants (Dorevitch
et al., 2012b), AGI was deﬁned as the occurrence of these symptoms during the three days following enrollment (rather than the
10e12 day period used in NEEAR). The 0e3 day window was
selected because since the publication of NEEAR ﬁndings, it has
become clear from KaplaneMeier analyses of CHEERS data
(Dorevitch et al., 2012b) as well as other cohort studies conducted
at California beaches (Arnold et al., 2013; Colford et al., 2012) that
the difference between water recreators and non-water recreators
in the rate of new onset AGI symptoms is greatest during that brief,
initial time period following water recreation. Individuals with any
gastrointestinal symptoms when starting water recreation were
excluded from analyses of AGI.
2.2. Water sample analysis
Grab samples of surface water (<10 cm from the surface) were
collected every two hours during water recreation using a telescoping pole from boat launches and piers at locations where recreation began and ended. Recreation and recruitment took place at
1e4 recreational areas per study day, and water sampling locations
at each recreational area were constant throughout the duration of
the study. Grab samples were for analysis of E. coli, enterococci,
somatic coliphage, Fþ coliphage, and turbidity. Twenty liter samples were collected approximately every 6 h for protozoan (oo)cyst
analysis. Grab samples were analyzed by membrane ﬁltration for E.
coli (EPA Method 1603) and enterococci (EPA Method 1600) using
ﬁve different dilutions per sample. Culture results used in data
analyses were those from the dilution that produced approximately
20e60 colony forming units (CFU) per plate (USEPA R&D, 1978).
These analyses were performed by certiﬁed commercial laboratories. Scientiﬁc Methods, Inc. (Granger, IN) analyzed somatic and
Fþ coliphage analyses by EPA Method 1602, and Giardia spp. and
Cryptosporidium spp. (oo)cyst analyses by EPA Method 1623
following continuous ﬂow centrifugation of 20 L samples as
described previously (Dorevitch et al., 2011a). Turbidity was
measured on site using HF Scientiﬁc MicroTPW portable turbidimeters. Quality assurance measures included the use of blinded
ﬁeld blanks, replicate samples, and spiked samples. Participants



96

were enrolled into the study over periods that ranged from 1 to 12 h
per location per day of recruitment. The location-speciﬁc daily
mean of each water quality measure was linked to the health survey data of all participants enrolled that day at that location (Arnold
et al., 2013; Wade et al., 2008).
Data quality of microbe measures was evaluated by analysis of
1) initial and ongoing recovery studies of spike matrix samples, 2)
precision of split-sample analyses, and 3) holding time. Between
August 1, 2008 and May 8, 2009 mean recoveries for E. coli and
enterococci were acceptable, but recovery within individual spiked
samples was highly variable and ﬁeld blanks were occasionally
positive, while samples from highly polluted waters were often
negative for enterococci and E. coli. Data quality remained excellent
during this period for coliphages and protozoan parasites, which
were collected, processed, and transported by the same staff as
those who collected the samples for FIB analysis, but were analyzed
at a different laboratory (Scientiﬁc Methods, Inc., Granger, IN). As a
result of this persistent problem, a different commercial laboratory
(Microbac, Inc., Merrillville, IN) was used for the remainder of the
study for analyses of FIB. Sporadically, during the period of generally acceptable performance, the quality monitoring criteria were
not met and data were also considered missing for E. coli (16 of 99
dates) and enterococci (20 of 99 dates). Epidemiologic data analysis
excluded E. coli and enterococci data from dates that quality
monitoring criteria were not met. Water quality was described in
two ways: as a summary of water quality measurements, and as a
summary of water quality measurements weighted by the number
of people who participated in the study each day at each location.
The un-weighted approach reﬂects surface water quality while the
weighted approach reﬂects the water quality exposures of study
participants.
2.3. Data analysis
Logistic regression was used to model the occurrence of AGI.
Seven sets of models were run for efﬂuent dominated waters and
seven sets for general use waters. Each set of models containing one
measure of water quality (one of the two indicator bacteria, two
indicator viruses, two protozoan pathogens, or turbidity) plus
covariates. Covariates considered to be potential confounders were
season (summer vs. spring or fall), age category (10 years, 11e64
years, 65 years), gender, race (white vs. other), recreational activity (ﬁshing, rowing, other), swallowing water during recreation
(any vs. none), face got wet (any vs. none), face/head was drenched
or submerged (vs. lower degrees of exposure), a history of chronic
gastrointestinal condition, and frequent use of the same water
location group (efﬂuent-dominated or general use) in the past year
(deﬁned post-hoc as 15 or more times as this cut-point resulted in
the strongest association with GI illness occurrence). Washing
hands after recreation but prior to eating/drinking was considered
as a potential confounder. Eating speciﬁc foods in the 72 h before
recreation was not considered, as prior analyses found that the
ingestion of undercooked meat, fresh produce, pre-packaged
sandwich, raw or runny eggs, shellﬁsh, or sushi were unassociated with illness in multivariate models (Dorevitch et al., 2012b).
Additionally, variables that were evaluated as potential effect
modiﬁers (described below) but for which interaction terms did not
approach statistical signiﬁcance were also considered for inclusion
in models as confounders. All models were run using a single set of
observations that had complete data for covariates other than
water quality.
Potential modiﬁers of associations between water quality and
illness were deﬁned a priori: 1) whether the study participant used
waters dominated by wastewater efﬂuent vs. general use waters; 2)
the occurrence of precipitation within the prior 48 h; and 3) the

number of times a participant used the same water location group
(efﬂuent dominated vs. general use) in the prior year (Lee et al.,
1997), which may impact susceptibility to infection. For users of
efﬂuent-dominated waters only, two other potential effect modiﬁers were considered a priori: the perceived health risk of water
recreation on the Chicago River system, as perceived risk has been
shown to impact symptom reporting (Fleisher and Kay, 2006); and
the occurrence of combined sewer overﬂow events within the 72 h
prior to recreation. To identify potential effect modiﬁers, AGI was
modeled using three predictors: a measure of water quality, a potential effect modiﬁer, and the interaction term of the two (for
example, precipitation, E. coli, and precipitation*E. coli). A separate
set of models was run for each of the seven measures of water
quality. Interaction terms signiﬁcant at a p  0.30 level were
included as effect modiﬁers in subsequent full models (which
contained the potential confounders noted in the prior paragraph).
Three-way interactions (e.g., water quality * location group * precipitation) were not explored. Instead models stratiﬁed by location
group were ﬁtted, for example water quality * precipitation, for
efﬂuent-dominated and separately for general use waters.
Three variations of each of the seven sets of models (each containing a different measure of water quality), for each water location group, were run, parameterizing water quality one of three
ways: as continuous variables on a linear scale, on a log10 scale, as
binary variables dichotomized at the 75th percentile value, and as
an estimate of ingested dose (on linear and log10 scales). The 75th
percentile values were speciﬁc to each location group. The ingested
dose of microbes was estimated using results from the post recreation survey, in which participants were asked whether they had
swallowed water during recreation, and if so, whether they had
swallowed “a drop or two,” “a teaspoon,” or “a mouthful or more.”
The estimated dose of microbe ingested was the product of the daylocation microbe density and the estimated volume of water
ingested by individual participants. Though not a microbe dose,
volume ingested*turbidity was calculated as well.
A change in estimate (CIE) approach was used to reduce a full
model (containing all covariates under consideration) to a more
parsimonious model while retaining confounders. This was
accomplished by using the SAS® CIE macro (Atashili and Ta, 2007)
to sequentially remove covariates that had the smallest impact on
the parameter estimate of the water quality term. Beginning with n
covariates, n models each containing n1 covariates, each missing
a different term, were run. The change in the parameter estimate of
the water quality term was evaluated relative to the water quality
parameter estimate obtained in the full model. The covariate that,
when dropped from the model had the smallest impact on the
water quality-AGI association was removed from subsequent iterations. This process was repeated until a covariate, when removed,
resulted in a 5% change in the parameter estimate of the water
quality term. Final models were ﬁtted for each water group
(efﬂuent dominated and general use) and preferred models were
identiﬁed based on HosmereLemeshow goodness of ﬁt testing.
Because some of the covariates selected by the CIE process might be
on the causal pathway between water quality and illness (such as
water exposure metrics), models were run with and without such
terms. In addition to associations between water quality and illness,
we sought to characterize the associations between other covariates and illness. For each water location group a set of common
covariates was identiﬁed based on their presence in the various
location-group by water quality models. Some covariates were
selected for inclusion by the CIE process for nearly all models, while
speciﬁc exposure terms (swallowed any water, face got wet, face
got drenched, etc.) and recreation terms (rowing vs. other, ﬁshing
vs. other) varied. Exposure and activity variables that were found in
the largest number of models were included in the common set of

covariates for modeling illness occurrence in each location group.

This research was approved by the UIC Institutional Review
Board and included a written documentation of informed consent/
assent.

3. Results
3.1. Study participants
7710 water recreators enrolled in the study and participated in
telephone follow-up. Of these, 342 (4.4%) had at least one GI
symptom at baseline and were excluded from analysis. Of the 7368
water recreators at risk for developing AGI, complete coliphage,
parasite, and turbidity data were available for 4929 (67%) participants (due to the period of inconsistent commercial laboratory
performance noted under “Methods,” E. coli and enterococci data
were only available for 3833 and 3755 participants respectively).
The distributions of demographic, water recreation and health risk
data of the remaining 4929 participants are summarized in Table 1.
The distribution of all characteristics were nearly identical for
participants whose data were used in analyses of water quality and
health, and for the 7368 water recreators, including those for whom
complete data on all variables was not available (Supplemental
Information 1). Boating, rowing, and kayaking were more common among users of efﬂuent dominated waters, while ﬁshing and
canoeing were more common among general use waters
recreators.

3.2. Water quality
The seven measures of water quality are summarized by water
location group (Table 2), with and without weighting by the
number of participants who enrolled in the study on a given daylocation. The weighted measures are somewhat higher than the
un-weighted values, indicating that water quality tended to be
worse on days (or during seasons) that participant enrollment was
greater. Median un-weighted E. coli and enterococci densities at
efﬂuent-dominated locations were more than double the US EPA
Recreational Water Quality beach action values of 235 and 75 CFU/
100 mL, respectively (expected to limit the rate of gastrointestinal
illness among swimmers to 36 cases/1000 users) (USEPA, 2012). At
efﬂuent-dominated waters the median densities of coliphages and
E. coli were 10e30 times greater than at general use waters. Within
the general use water locations, water quality differed by location
subgroups, with microbe densities highest at rivers; lower at inland
lakes, ponds, and lagoons; and lowest at Lake Michigan locations.
This pattern was more apparent for the indicator bacteria than for
other measures of quality. Enterococci densities in particular were
quite high with median densities in general use rivers that were
more than 20 times EPA criteria values for beaches (Supplemental
Information 2).
3.3. Crude models of AGI occurrence
Covariate data were missing from 241 participants (4.7%) who
were excluded from analyses. The variables that contained missing
data were the frequency with which participants recreated at the
location of enrollment over the past year (n ¼ 235), race (n ¼ 5), and
pre-existing GI conditions (n ¼ 1). As previously reported, AGI
occurred among 4.30% of recreators on efﬂuent-dominated waters
and 4.25% at general use waters (as well as 3.43% of non-water
recreators) (Dorevitch et al., 2012b). However, in the subset reported here (with complete covariate data, including water quality), 4.28% of recreators on efﬂuent-dominated waters and 3.92% of
those who used general use waters developed AGI.
In unadjusted models, daily location-speciﬁc measures (on a
log10 scale) of the indicator bacteria, indicator viruses, and Giardia
cysts were not associated with AGI (Table 3). This was true for water
recreators overall and, in stratiﬁed analyses, for subgroups deﬁned
by location group and by water exposure. Among water recreators
who reported getting their head or face wet during recreation, inverse associations between AGI incidence and Cryptosporidium
oocysts were observed for water recreators overall and for general
use recreators. Inverse associations between AGI incidence and
turbidity were observed for water recreators overall, for each water
location group, and for both exposure (face wet) categories, though
not all of these associations reached statistical signiﬁcance at a
p < 0.05 level (Table 3).
3.4. Adjusted models of AGI occurrence following recreation at
efﬂuent dominated waters
Of the potential modiﬁers of water quality-AGI associations for
water recreation on efﬂuent-dominated waters, one, perceived
health risk of recreation on the Chicago River system, met criteria
for inclusion as a modiﬁer of water quality-AGI associations based
on the interaction term p-value <0.3. Participants reported
perceived health risk of water recreation on the Chicago River
system on a 0e10 scale. The strongest association between
perceived risk and AGI was observed (post-hoc) with the 0e10 scale
dichotomized at a score of 7, (odds ratio; 95% conﬁdence interval
1.47; 0.97, 2.24). However, in multivariate models of AGI stratiﬁed
by perceived risk category (high vs. low), the microbe-AGI

of water recreation on the Chicago River system, and the presence
of chronic gastrointestinal condition (Table 4).
In adjusted models, among users of efﬂuent-dominated waters,
measures of water quality were not associated with AGI whether or
not covariates that might be on the causal pathway were excluded.
Table 4 summarizes associations between AGI, water quality, and
covariates in the best-ﬁtting models for each measure of water
quality (results of other models is provided in Supplemental
Information 4). Removal of covariates that might be on the causal
pathway linking water quality and illness had little impact on
measures of association with one exception: the log10 enterococcieAGI association achieved borderline signiﬁcance(p ¼ 0.09)
in the reduced model (Table 4). The variables that were consistently
associated with an increased odds of AGI were the presence of a
chronic GI condition and high perceived risk of water recreation on
the Chicago River system. Odds of AGI were decreased among those
whose face remained dry during water recreation. Fit of models in

associations had wide conﬁdence intervals and did not approach
statistical signiﬁcance in either the high or low category of
perceived risk. For that reason, strata were collapsed. Based on prior
work of Fleisher and Kay (2006), perceived risk was evaluated for
inclusion in subsequent models as a potential confounder using the
CIE approach.
CIE-based selection substantially reduced the number of covariates in models of AGI for users of efﬂuent-dominated waters. Age
category and gender had minimal impacts on the water quality-AGI
association, while, depending on the microbe and the way it was
parameterized (linear, log10, dichotomous, or dose), others variables impacted the water quality-AGI association and were therefore included as confounders in ﬁnal models. A set of variables
common to most microbe-speciﬁc models were: ﬁshing, frequent
use of the same water recreation location group (efﬂuent-dominated vs. general use), head/face having gotten wet, recent precipitation, hand washing following water recreation, perceived risk

S. Dorevitch et al. / Water Research 83 (2015) 94e103

In adjusted models of incidental contact recreation at general
use waters, one variable, precipitation in the preceding 48 h, met
criteria for inclusion in models as a modiﬁer of water quality-GI
illness occurrence associations. Table 5 summarizes associations
between AGI, water quality, and covariates in the best-ﬁtting
models for each measure of water quality (results of other models
is provided in Supplemental Information 5a and 5b). In models
with acceptable ﬁt, no measure of water quality was associated
with AGI. This was also the case after removing covariates that are
potentially on the causal pathway (Supplemental Information 6).
With the general use water data stratiﬁed into the wet weather and
dry weather strata, associations between AGI and chronic GI conditions or face exposure to water (which were signiﬁcant in models
of AGI among users of efﬂuent-dominated waters) did not approach
statistical signiﬁcance. As was the case with models of AGI among
users of efﬂuent dominated waters, in models of AGI among users
of general use waters terms for microbe dose (rather than microbe
concentration) were not signiﬁcant.
3.6. Adjusted models of AGI occurrence following recreation,
combined location groups
Analyses of the set of all water users was performed because
interaction terms for location group (efﬂuent dominated vs. general
use) were either non-signiﬁcant or in cases in which interaction
terms were signiﬁcant, water quality terms were not signiﬁcant in
either stratum of location group. The all water recreator analyses
(Table 6) showed that in best ﬁtting models measures of water
quality did not predict AGI (ﬁt of other models with varying ways of
parameterizing water quality is summarized in Supplemental
Information 7). Compared to models that included a water quality
term, those that did not generated similar measures of association
between illness occurrence and other covariates. The odds of AGI
were approximately twice as high among those who had a chronic
gastrointestinal condition (such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reﬂux, irritable bowel syndrome, or inﬂammatory
bowel disease) compared to those who did not, even though all
participants included in the analyses indicated that they were free
of GI symptoms at the time of water recreation. Frequent use of the
water at the location at which participants were enrolled decreased
the risk of AGI by a factor of approximately half. Compared to those
who engaged in other limited contact water recreation activities,
those who ﬁshed appear to be at signiﬁcantly greater risk of
developing AGI than those who engaged in other limited contact
water recreation activities. Hand washing between the time of
water recreation and eating or drinking (but before the postrecreation ﬁeld interview) appears to be associated with a lower
odds of AGI based on point estimates of the odds ratio of 0.7e0.8,
though this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance at a p < 0.05 level.
4. Discussion
In the largest cohort study of incidental contact recreation to
date, despite the wide range of water quality and the fairly common
occurrence of AGI (approximately 4% of study participants), measures of water quality were not useful as predictors the occurrence

of AGI.
Water quality in the efﬂuent-dominated waters was poor, and
median densities of FIB were an order of magnitude or more higher
than those observed in epidemiologic studies of swimming at
beaches (Arnold et al., 2013; Colford et al., 2007; Wade et al., 2010).
While fecal indicator concentrations at Lake Michigan beaches
were generally below EPA Beach Action Values (USEPA, 2012), at
the other general use waters e rivers and inland lakes e FIB densities were considerably higher (Supplemental Information 2).
Nevertheless, the frequency of illness among incidental contact
recreators in the two water location groups was comparable. The
risk of AGI was higher among those who reported a chronic
gastrointestinal condition. Fishing (relative to other incidental
contact recreation activities) appears to be associated with a higher
risk of AGI. A decreased incidence of AGI was associated with
frequent use of a water recreation location and completing recreation without exposure of the face to water.
The absence of associations between measures of water quality
and GI illness during incidental contact recreation in the settings
we studied is in contrast with ﬁndings of studies of swimmers at
freshwater beaches impacted by publically-owned wastewater
treatment works (POTW). In those studies the risk of AGI increased
with higher densities of enterococci measured by culture (USEPA,
1984) or qPCR (Wade et al., 2008). Likewise in a study of swimmers at a freshwater reservoir in Ohio, E. coli measured by culture
was associated with gastrointestinal illness despite relatively low E.
coli densities (Marion et al., 2010). Approximately 95% of the ﬂow in
the Chicago River system is wastewater efﬂuent that had been
treated with activated sludge but without disinfection (Rijal et al.,
2011). Aerobic digestion of wastewater results in greater reductions of indicator bacteria than pathogens (Harwood et al.,
2005), which might explain a lack of association between indicators and GI illness incidence. However, positive associations
have been observed between indicators and protozoan pathogens
in surface waters used in CHEERS (Yavuz et al., 2014). Thus,
although positive associations between indicator bacteria and
illness might be expected, this was not observed. Perhaps this is

due to the smaller volumes of water swallowed during incidental
contact water recreation than swimming. We have previously
estimated using tracer methods the volume of water ingested using
questionnaire and chemical tracer methods during a variety of
activities in a swimming pool, including swimming, canoeing,
kayaking, wading, and simulated ﬁshing. That work suggests that
the self-reported volume of water ingested in a pool or on surface
waters during limited contact recreation is perhaps half the volume
of water ingested than while swimming laps (Dorevitch et al.,
2011b). A 50% lower rate of water ingestion seems unlikely to account for the lack of association between FIB and AGI occurrence
among users of the waters that are predominantly wastewater
efﬂuent. We did not observe differences in associations between
AGI and precipitation. Precipitation was deﬁned as any precipitation in the past 48 h, and days with 0.01 inches of precipitation
were fairly common. Future analyses of effect modiﬁcation of
microbe-AGI associations using other deﬁnitions of precipitation
(such as exceedances of a higher threshold value or looking at
shorter time frames, such as the 24 h prior to recreation) may be
useful.
Two studies of incidental contact water recreation have been
have been conducted at a whitewater slalom course fed by a mix of
treated and untreated wastewater in the United Kingdom (Fewtrell
et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1997). Despite much smaller sample sizes
(hundreds, rather than thousands of participants enrolled as was
the case in CHEERS), gastrointestinal symptom occurrence among
canoeists and rafters at the white water course was associated with
Fþ coliphages. A potential explanation for the discordant ﬁndings
(risk increased with increasing Fþ coliphages in the UK study but
not in CHEERS) is that water quality was poorer in the UK study,
where enterovirus was present in ﬁve of the nine sampling study
dates; in CHEERS 20% of surface water samples contained enterovirus RNA (and not necessarily infectious enterovirus) (Aslan et al.,
2011). Second, water ingestion was likely greater in the UK whitewater slalom course compared to the low-velocity Chicago River
system. “Unintentional swimming” (following capsize) occurred
with some frequency on the UK slalom course, and occurred more

than twice per study day for some participants. Although the frequency of these exposures was not reported, it may have been
greater than the 2% frequency of head/face submersion occurred
among CHEERS participants (Table 1). Thus, with less water
ingestion and lower densities of pathogens in water ingested,
participants at the efﬂuent-dominated Chicago River system locations may have ingested lower doses of viable pathogens, resulting
in associations between microbe densities and gastrointestinal
illness risk that could not be detected.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst epidemiologic
study of water recreation that evaluated measures of protozoan
parasites as predictors of illness. We found no association between
densities or presence of Giardia or Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts and
the occurrence of AGI. This should not be surprising, given that no
differences in the risk of water recreation were identiﬁed between
users of the efﬂuent-dominated and general use waters (Dorevitch
et al., 2012b), despite the much higher densities of the parasites (as
well as higher frequencies of detecting adenovirus (Aslan et al.,
2011)) at efﬂuent-dominated than at general use waters locations.
CHEERS participants were followed by phone for onset of symptoms through day 21 post-recreation, which should have been
sufﬁcient to identify cases of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis; however analyses of stool samples of 740 CHEERS participants who
developed GI symptoms did not identify Giardia, Cryptosporidium,
or any other pathogens as causes of symptoms (Dorevitch et al.,
2012a). To predict illness we also used a novel estimate of exposure, the estimated dose of indicators and pathogens, which takes
into account both volume of water ingested and density of microbes in water. While the estimated dose of protozoan pathogens
did not predict illness occurrence in the settings studied, pathogen
measurement e including viral pathogens e should be pursued in
future studies, particularly studies of swimming, given that the
loading, transport, and fate of protozoan parasites in our setting
may not be representative of these and other pathogens in other
settings. Similarly the estimated dose of microbes should be
explored in future studies, particularly those set in locations in
which water quality measures typically do predict illness (POTWimpacted freshwater swimming beaches).
CHEERS participants at general use waters who used the same
water recreation site 15 or more time within the past year were
about one third as likely to develop AGI than participants who
engaged in water recreation at that site less frequently, after
adjusting for water quality, water exposure, and other covariates.
This is consistent with the observation of Lee et al., who noted that
at the UK whitewater slalom course, canoeists and rafters who had
used the course seven or more times previously were about 1/3 as
likely to develop gastrointestinal symptoms as those who had not
used the course before (Lee et al., 1997). Lee et al. proposed several
potential explanations for this that are reasonable in our context as
well. Frequent users may have a higher skill level and are able to
avoid swallowing water; frequent use may result in clinical and/or
subclinical infections that generate some degree of immunity, and
self-selection may occur, with individuals who develop illness
choosing to avoid future exposures, while those who stay well return for repeated recreational events.
Final models of AGI (that included water quality, demographic,
medical, and exposure covariates) found that participants who
ﬁshed (from a boat or from shore) were 50% more likely to develop
illness as participants who engaged in other incidental contact
activities. This ﬁnding was robust to sensitivity analyses that
eliminated from analysis speciﬁc dates and locations of enrollment
(data not presented). We are not aware of other observational
studies that have addressed short term illness risks of ﬁshing.
Cryptosporidium oocysts have been detected in samples of ﬁsh
caught by urban anglers in Baltimore, MD, and on hands of the

anglers (Roberts et al., 2007). In that study, a probability of Cryptosporidium infection among anglers was estimated to be approximately 1e8 per 10 anglers. While none of the 740 stool samples
collected from symptomatic CHEERS participants contained Cryptosporidium (Dorevitch et al., 2012a) the presence of this pathogen
may indicate the presence of others, including one (or more)
responsible for illness. The hand-to-mouth and hand-to-object-tomouth activities of ﬁshermen, particularly those who eat, drink,
and/or smoke during ﬁshing, may provide additional pathways of
exposure to pathogens which would be less available to competitive rowers (who do not eat or smoke during training or races). In a
setting similar to the one we studied, ﬁsherman in a polluted
catchment area of New York City perceived a low degree of risk of
eating ﬁsh that they caught despite the presence of warnings and
advisories, in part because they believed that they could differentiate safe from unsafe ﬁsh (Burger et al., 1993). We propose that
while water recreators in general are exposed to surface water and
its contaminants, the elevated risk of AGI among ﬁshers is due to
their additional exposure to microbes present on bait and on ﬁsh.
5. Conclusions
Gastrointestinal illness following incidental contact water recreation was not readily predicted by measures of water quality in
the settings studied. Protozoan pathogens, while frequently
detected, were not useful as predictors of illness. Based on our
ﬁndings, the risk of gastrointestinal illness following incidental
contact water recreation might be reduced by efforts to decrease
exposure among at risk groups, such as those who have limited
prior experience on the water, those with underlying gastrointestinal conditions, and those who ﬁsh. Such efforts may include education about the hazards of capsizing and swallowing water and
promoting frequent hand washing.
