ABSTRACT
Stu(dies evaluating the relationship between microbes and human health at non-point source
beaches are necessary for establishing criteria which would protect pubiic health while minimizing
economic burdens. The objective of this study was to evaluate water quality and daily cumulative
health effects (gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory illnesses) for bathers at a non-point source
subtropical marine recreational beach in order to better understand the inter-relationships between
these factors and hence improve monitoring and pollution prevention techniques. Daily composite
samples were collected, during the Oceans and Human Health Beach Exposure Assessment and
Characterization Health Epidemiologie Study conducted in Miami (Florida, USA) at a non-point source
beach, and analyzed for several pathogens, microbial source tracking markers, indicator microbes,
and environmental parameters. Analysis demonstrated that rainfall and tide were more influential,
when compared to other environmental factors and source tracking markers, in determining the
presence of both indicator microbes and pathogens. Antecedent rainfall and F+ coliphage detection
in water should be further assessed to confirm their possible association with skin and
gastrointestinal (Gl) illness outcomes, respectively. The results of this research illustrate the potential
complexity of beach systems characterized by non-point sources, and how more novel and

INTRODUCTION
Illness associated with microbial pathogens in recreational
marine beaches can have significant health and economic
impacts. Globally, each year, there are in excess of 120
million cases of gastrointestinal disease and in excess of
50 million cases of respiratory diseases caused by swimming
and bathing in wastewater-poUuted coastal waters (Shuval
2003). A study in Orange County, California, USA demonstrated an estimated 3.3 million US dollars per year in

excess illness costs for Newport and Huntington beaches
(Dwight et al. 2005). Since the 1950s, epidemiologic studies
have been performed to evaluate relationships between
bathing in point source impacted beaches and health risk
(gastrointestinal disease, respiratory, skin, eye, and ear illnesses); and they concluded that symptoms for all these
illnesses were increased in bathers compared to non-bathers
(Priiss 1998).

Microbes and human health at a non-point source marine beach

Indicator microbes are used routinely to evaluate risk of
illness from recreational bathing at beaches. These nonpathogenic microbes serve as surrogates for microbial pollution containing pathogenic microbes and are utilized for
several reasons. These reasons include: their high concentrations in raw untreated human sewage, ease of detection,
and in some cases, associations with human illness rates.
Studies show that the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)-recommended indicator microbe for marine beaches,
enterococci, has demonstrated a significant association with
illness in point source impacted marine beaches, at least in
temperate climates (Priiss 1998; Wade et al. 2003).
As was shown with point source impacted beaches,
swimming in non-point source impacted beaches may also
be a cause of increased illness when compared to nonbathers (Colford et al. 2007; Bonilla et al. 2007; Fleisher
et al. 2010; Sinigalliano et al. 2010). However a relationship
between enterococci and bather health has not been consistently established at non-point source impacted or
subtropical marine beaches (Priiss 1998; Haile et al. 1999;
Wade et al. 2003; Colford et al. 2007). Recent studies however have shown preliminary relationships between health
outcomes and indicators. A study conducted in Miami,
Florida demonstrated a relationship between enterococci
measured by membrane filtration and skin illness, between
24 hour prior rainfall and skin illness, and between
water temperature and acute febrile respiratory illness
(Sinigalliano et al. 2010). Another study conducted on the
California west coast demonstrated a relationship between
male-speciñc coliphage and several symptoms reported by
bathers (Colford et al. 2007).
In addition to the lack of a consistent association between
enterococci and bather health at non-point source impacted
and subtropical marine beaches, there are many limitations
to using indicator microbes to monitor for fecal contamination and significant human health risk. Enterococci can
originate from sources other than humans, and therefore
the ratios of pathogens to enterococci may not be consistent
with that of human fecal pollution. Enterococci are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, and they do not
necessarily address the risks for non-gastrointestinal illnesses,
since their association was originally established specifically
with gastrointestinal illness (Boehm et al. 2009). Additionally,
research has shown that the presence and levels of indicators

Journal of Water and Health

2011

are not always associated with pathogens in areas impacted
by non-point sources of indicator organisms (e.g. rainfall
runoff, animals, human shedding, and sand re-suspension)
(Deetz et al. 1984; Fujioka et al. 1981; Gerba & Rose 1990;
Jiang et al. 2001; Noble & Fuhrman 2001; Jiang & Chu 2004).
Furthermore, at both subtropical and temperate climates,
the indicator bacteria can multiply in the environment,
giving a false impression of an increase of fecal pollution,
which is in turn interpreted through current US federal guidelines as an increase in human health risk (Fujioka et al. 1981;
Solo-Gabriele et al. 2000; Desmarais et al. 2002; Whitman
et al. 2003; Shibata et al. 2004; Whitman et al. 2004; Alm
et al. 2006; Beversdorf e/ al. 2007).
Monitoring directly for the specific disease-causing
pathogens themselves would be ideal. Studies have shown
the presence of pathogenic viruses (such as enteroviruses,
reoviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus)
in marine waters in many areas (including Greece, Italy,
California, Florida, and Hawaii) (Griffln et al. 2003; Ortega
et al. 2009). Pathogenic protozoa and bacteria have also
been detected in recreational beaches (Elmir et al. 2007;
Sunderland et al. 2007; Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Graczyk
et al. 2010). However, in both point and non-point source
impacted marine beaches in temperate and sub/tropical
climates, epidemiologic studies have not established associations between health risk and specific pathogens. To the
author's knowledge, Haile et al. (1999) was the only study
which measured pathogens (enterovirus), other then S.
aureus (Fujioka et al. 1994), in conjunction with human
effects. Several epidemiologic studies have been initiated
at several California beaches (Avalon, Doheny, and
Malibu), which have measured pathogens in conjunction
with health effects and publications from these studies are
pending. The US EPA has also initiated studies in Mississippi, Rhode Island, Alabama, and Puerto Rico, but these
study results are also pending and focus on point source
impacted beaches. To date, no published studies have evaluated pathogens and health effects concurrently within a
subtropical beach environment.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the water
quality (indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental
factors) and daily cumulative health effects (gastrointestinal,
skin, and respiratory illnesses) for bathers at a non-point
source subtropical marine recreational beach. This study

evaluated the relationships between microbes and environmental conditions; it also evaluated the inter-relationship
between health effects and water quality, and identified possible implications for beach regulation practices. Given cost
limitations when screening multiple targets including pathogens and concurrently assessing human health, this study was
not intended to establish a conclusive relationship between
the various factors and targets, but rather to give further
insight on how the non-point source beach system functions.
The results of this study should be utilized with results from
other epidemiologic and water quality studies to establish
conclusive statements about the relationship between water
quality and human health at non-point source beaches. This
study differs from previously published work as part of the
BEACHES study (Fleisher et al. 2010; Sinigalliano et al.
2010; Shibata et al. 2010) by reporting the results from daily
composite samples during the BEACHES study therefore
allowing many more microbiological measures to be compared to environmental parameters and health outcomes
and providing an alternate perspective to beach monitoring
through composite as opposed to grab samples.

METHODS
Site description
Samples were collected from a study beach within MiamiDade County, Florida, USA (Figure 1). The climate of
Miami is classified as 'subtropical' because of its geographic
location, and its average ambient temperature of 24.8 C.
The study beach is an irregularly narrow beach, with an
approximate average distance between the mean water
line and the outer edge of the sand of 5 m. The beach is
1.6 km long, relatively shallow, and characterized by weak
water circulation (Shibata et al. 2004). This beach is the
only beach in Miami-Dade County where visitors can
bring their pets, particularly dogs. Beach admission is free,
and many bathers frequent the beach, particularly during
the summer months (Wang et al. 2010). Extensive prior
evaluation of the vicinity of the study beach had not found
point sources of pollution to this beach (such as sewage outfalls, failing lift stations) or other direct sewage inputs (such
as through septic tanks) (Shibata et al. 2004). However

several potential non-point sources of pollution such as
sand efflux, trash bins, bather shedding, rainfall runoff, offshore boat dumping, dogs and other animals may impact
the study beach (Wright et al. 200g; Wright et al. 2on).
Sand efflux is believed to be significant (Zhu et al. accepted)
due to elevated levels of indicators observed in the sand
along with intermittent detection of pathogens including
Giardia spp., Gryptosporidium spp., enterovirus, and Vibrio
vulnificus (Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shah et al. accepted).
This beach is usually in compliance with regulatory monitoring criteria, but periodically (i.e. 2.1 times per year averaged
from 2002 to 2010) has been placed under an advisory due
to microbiai water quality violations (Polk D., personal
communication).
Epidemiologie study
Sampling occurred as part of the Oceans and Htunan Health
Beach Exposure Assessment and Characterization Health
Epidemiologic Study, 'BEACHES' (Fleisher et al. 2010). In
brief, this study was the first randomized control exposure epidemiological study to be conducted in the United States. The
study design involved randomly assigning adults who report
regularly bathing in South Florida to either a 'bather' or 'nonbather' category. Bathers were asked to spend 15 minutes in

the water, while non-bathers spent 15 minutes on the beach.
Approval was obtained by the Florida Department of Health
Internal Review Board (IRB 1491; DOH IRB Number,
H07164) and the University of Miami Internal Review Board
(IRB 20070306) to include bathers in this study (Fleisher
et al. 2oio). As part of the BEACHES study two distinct types
of water samples were collected, 'individual' samples collected
by individual bathers and 'daily composite samples' which
were combined water samples collected throughout each
sampling day. The earlier published work focused on describing the epidemiologic data (Fleisher et al. 2010) and also
evaluated, for the 'individual' samples, dose-response relafionships between microbes and environmental measures and
health effects (Sinigalliano et al. 2010). The current manuscript
complements these earlier publications by reporting the results
from the daily composite samples, comparing microbiological
and environmental measurements, as well as evaluating
combined human illness rates corresponding to the daily composite samples. The results from the daily composite samples
have not been reported elsewhere. Due to the fewer number
and larger sample sizes of the daily composite samples, many
more microbiological measures were included in the analyses
allowing for the comparisons between a much broader range
of microbes. In this manuscript, illness among individual
participants was combined on a daily basis (number of participants who became ill relafive to the total number of
participants per day), and then excess illness was computed
(average daily difference in percentages for gastrointestinal,
skin, and acute respiratory febrile illnesses between bathers
and non-bathers). This approach yields, however, an underesfimate of risk due to the misclassification of exposure (i.e. the
assignment of a single daily microbial exposure value to multiple bathers with different exposures albeit on the same day)
(Fleisher et al. 1993). Nevertheless this approach provides an
alternative perspective to monitoring and hence beach regulation through compositing samples over several hours and
from different locations as opposed to grab sampling.
Sample collection and measurement of
physical-chemical parameters
Fifteen sampling events were conducted on 15 different
sampling days ranging from December 2007 to June 2008
as part of the BEACHES study described above. Sampling

occurred over the study day span of 3.5 hours starting at
approximately 8:00 am and ending at 11:30 am local time.
Two sets of composite water samples were collected and
analyzed per sampling day: 'bather-collected composite'
and 'investigator-collected composite'. Bathers (30-60 per
sampling day), assigned to spend 15 minutes in the water,
each collected 5 L water samples in pre-sterilized sampling
containers. These bathers collected samples from their
sampling zone (area of exposure) at knee depth, which
varied with tide (Figure 1). Bathers were trained (asked to
conduct a thorough pre-rinse of the sample container,
avoid touching the inside of the container, and to sample
just below the surface of the water, etc.) on how to collect
the water sample to minimize variafion between bathers.
One liter of each of these samples was added to a50Lpresterilized carboy, and this sample (30 to 50 L) was called the
'bather-collected composite'. When there were greater than
50 bathers, smaller sample aliquots (0.8 L) were added to
the 50 L carboy to not exceed the carboy capacity. The
remaining 4 L collected by bathers was also analyzed individually on a 'per bather basis' and was thus not composited;
the analysis of the remaining 4 L has been discussed elsewhere (see Fleisher et al. 2010; Sinigalliano et al. 2010).
Another composite sample was also collected by study
staff and called the 'investigator-collected composite'. This
sample involved collecting two 10 L water samples at
knee depth approximately every 10 minutes from the time
the first bather entered the water and throughout the 3.5
hour sampling duration. Invesfigators collected samples
using 5 gallon pre-sterilized buckets supported by a fioat.
Sample collection was done in a manner as to minimize
sediment disturbance and minimize contamination from
the invesfigators by standing downstream of the sampling
locafion. These 10 L aliquots were pooled into two 250 L
sterilized plastic drums by pouring approximately 5 L from
each aliquot into both drums. The total volume of this
sample ranged from 200 to 225 L/sampling day. The
sampling transect for the investigator-collected composite
samples was approximately 10 m away from the bather
sampling zone where the bather-collected composite
samples were collected in order to minimize the impacts
from the individual epidemiologic study participants
(Figure 1). Both the 50 L bather-collected carboy and 200
to 225 L investigator collected drum were kept in the

shade during the 3.5 hour sampling time to minimize temperature increase of the sample.
Water temperature, pH, salinity and turbidity were
measured for the bather-collected composite samples in
the field using a YSI probe (600R series sonde, YSI Inc.,
Yellow Springs, Ohio) and a turbidimeter (Model 66120200, VWR, Newark, DE, USA). Additionally, other environmental conditions were obtained from National Ocean and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (tidal height) and the
University of Miami (National Science Foundation (NSF)
National Insfitute of Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS) OHH Center Remote Sensing Facilities Core)
(rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation). Solar radiation,
tidal height, and wind speed were determined by averaging
measured values every 2 to 6 minutes from the time of the
first bather-collected sample to the last. Some peaks in
microbe measurements were noticed when the majority of
sampling for the composites occurred right after peak high
tide. This was further analyzed quantitafively by computing
the percentage of samples on a given sampling day which
were collected beyond peak high tide (post-HT sampling %).
For sampling days where sampling did not overlap with
peak high tide, this value was set to zero.

spp. via qPCR) and viruses (pan enterovirus, norovirus, and
hepatitis A via qPCR). The volumes analyzed for each
microbe, as well as a description of the methods used in
the analysis, are summarized in the electronic supplement
to this article (available at http://vs7ww.iwaponline.com/
jwh/146.pdf).
Concentration and analysis of investigator-coiiected
composite sampies
Investigator-collected composite samples, consisting of two
large drums of approximately 225 L, were used to collect
samples for pathogen analysis using tradifional large
volume concentration methods. Filters (Envirochek, PalF"^
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) obtained from processing the water
from one of the drums was used for protozoan analysis
{Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. via immunomagnetic separation followed by microscopic analysis), while
the filter obtained from the second drum (Filterite, PalF'^,
after acidification of water in the drum) was used for enterovirus analysis via culture. Details of the corresponding
analyses methods are included in the electronic supplement
to this article (available at http://www.iwaponline.com/
jwh/146.pdf).

Concentration and analysis of bather-coilected
composite sampies

Statistical analysis

Bather-collected composites were analyzed for many different microbes, including the EPA-recommended marine
bacterial indicator, enterococci, using three methods:
membrane filtration (MF), chromogenic substrate (CS),
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Additional microbial indicators (fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens by MF and coliphage
via single agar layer method) were measured as well as
human and dog-associated microbial source tracking
(MST) markers including Bacteriodales [Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, BacHum-UCD, HF8, and DogBac), human
polyomavirus (HPyVs) and the esp gene of Enterococcus
faecium. Pathogens evaluated included: bacteria {Staphylococcus aureus by MF, Vibrio vulnificus with enrichment by
MF and confirmation by PCR) and a low volume concentration method (bilayer method, Abdelzaher et al. 2009)
for processing protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia

Data were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk
test, and normalized using a log transformation when
needed. Parameters that did not meet normality requirements (such as rainfall, post-HT sampling %, pathogens,
coliphage, and all of the source tracking markers except
Bacteriodales BacHum-UCD), mostly due to being frequently below detecfion limits (i.e. left censured data),
were not evaluated statistically. Parameters that met the normality requirements were analyzed using the following
parametric tests: a student i-test was used to determine statistical significance of different results between the different
enterococci analysis methods using ExceF", and a Pearson
analysis was conducted using XLSTAP'" to determine correlation coefficients between parameters as well as their
statistical significance. The few values below detection
limits within these statistically analyzed parameters were
analyzed at their respective detection limits.

RESULTS
Heaith outcomes
The method for assessing illness, as well as other epidemiologic considerations using the individual exposure data,
have been previously described (Fleisher et al. 2010). The
number of total bathers per day ranged from 29 to 55
(avg = 43 ± 10), while the number of total non-bathers per
day ranged from 25 to 60 (avg = 43 ±11). This yielded a
total of 652 bathers and 651 non-bathers for the 15 study
days. Daily gastrointestinal, skin, and acute febrile respiratory illness reported in follow up interviews ranged from 0
to 3, 0 to 9, and 0 to 4 participants for bathers, and 0 to 2,
0 to 2, and 0 to 2 for non-bathers, respectively. The
total number of cases over the 15 study days for gastrointestinal, skin, and acute febrile respiratory illness were 31, 47,
and 12 for bathers, and 18, 9, and 4 for non-bathers,
respectively.
Illness rates were computed by subtracting daily illness
percentage rates of non-bathers from that of bathers, and
termed 'excess illness'. Average daily excess illness percentage rates for GI, skin and acute febrile respiratory illness
were 2.0 ± 3.3, 5.6 ± 4.7, and 1.2 ± 2.9%, respectively
(Figure 2). Negative excess illness values represented days
in which a higher illness percentage was reported in nonbathers when compared to bathers. Cumulative daily
excess health effects (sum of percentages of GI, skin, and
respiratory illness) ranged from - 7 % to 22%.
F - coliphage was detected on 3 of the 5 days characterized by the highest excess GI illness (see dotted rectangles
on Figure 2). F-l- coliphage was not detected in any of the
samples, and hence no association was apparent in this
study between this microbe and health conditions. The
3 highest levels of Bacteriodales BacHum-UCD human
marker corresponded to the 3 days characterized by the
highest excess skin illness. These 3 days also corresponded
to days when enterovirus were detected; 6-24 hour rainfall
was observed during 2 of the 3 days characterized by the
highest excess skin illness (see rounded rectangles on
Figure 2). The highest excess skin illness level on May 10th
also corresponded with the highest values of enterococci
measured by qPCR and CS, Bacteroidales DogBac marker.

cumulative pathogens {Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp.
and enterovirus), and the highest level (2.82 cm) of 6-24
rainfall (see solid rectangles on Figure 2).
Environmental parameters
The daily values for environmental parameters (pH, salinity, and temperature, turbidity and wind speed) for each
of the 15 bather-collected study samples over the 15 study
days can be found in the electronic supplement to this
article (available at http://www.iwaponline.com/jwh/146.
pdf). The average and standard deviation values for pH,
salinity, temperature, and wind speed were 8 ± 0.3,
35.6 ± 1.4 psu, 26.4 ± 3.0 C, and 6.7 ± 2.3 m/s, respectively. Solar radiation and tidal height yielded average
values of 307 ± 92 W/m^ and 0.35 ± 0.18 m, respectively
(Figure 2). The turbidity varied significantly between
study days, with a range of 2.8 to 64.4 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and an average of 14.5 ± 14.7 NTU.
Rainfall was detected immediately prior to 7 of the 15
sampling dates, and reported as 0-6 h, 6-24 h, and 24-48 h
rainfall prior to the mean sampling time (Figure 2).
Correlations were noted between water temperature
and solar radiation, as well as water temperature and turbidity (Table 1). The increase in turbidity in the water
with decreasing water temperature may be due to the presence of rainfall which occurs during cloudy conditions and
hence decreases solar radiation and water temperature.
Solar radiation was also found to correlate with enterococci (CS) (Table 1). Absolute tidal height was not
associated with any microbes; however, enterococci (MF)
values greater than the regulatory geometric mean value
of 35 colony-forming units (CFU) 100 ml ' occurred only
when sampling was conducted immediately after peak
high tide (i.e. post-HT sampling percentage greater than
0) (see circled areas on Figure 2).
Zero to 6 hour rainfall corresponded to elevated levels of
turbidity and bacterial indicators: enterococci (MF), E.coli,
fecal coliform, and C perfringens (see light gray shading in
Figure 2). Rainfall during the prior 6 to 24 hours had additional
significance. The simultaneous presence of Cryptosporidium
spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus only occiured after 6
to 24 h rain events (see medium gray shading in Figure 2).

The highest values of enterococci measured by qPCR and CS,
Bacteroidales DogBac marker, cumulative pathogens {Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus) occurred on
May 10th which had the highest level (2.82 cm) of 6-24 rainfall
(see solid rectangles on Figure 2).
Microbial indicators
Enterococci levels in water samples over the 15 sampling
days ranged from <2 to 109 CFU 100 ml"' using MF
methods, 11 to 124 MPN 100 ml"' using CS, and 46 to
2360 genome equivalent units (GEU) 100 ml ' using

qPCR (Figure 2). Measured concentrations of enterococci
by qPCR were greater than MF (p < 0.0001) and CS (p <
0.0001) measurements; while measurements by CS were
greater (p = 0.005) than those by MF. No significant
(p < 0.05) correlations were noted between each of the
enterococci measurement methods, qPCR, MF and CS.
Enterococci levels measured by CS correlated with
Bacteroidales BacHum-UCD levels and the inverse of
solar radiation (Table 1). Escherichia coli, fecal coliform,
and C. perfringens values ranged from <2 to 83, <2 to
196, and <2 to 1,653 CFU 100 m l ' , respectively
(Figure 2). The maximum values for these three indicators.

Note: Parameters that did not meet normality requirements (such as rainfaii, post HT

evaiuated statistically.

as well as the second highest value of enterococci (MF),
were measured from the March 8 samples which had
the highest level of 0-6 hour rainfall of 1.17 cm (Figure 2).
Correlations were noted between E.coli and the remaining
three indicator bacteria: enterococci (MF), C. perfringens,
and fecal coliform (Table 1). Glostridium perfringens also
correlated with enterococci (MF) (Table 1). Both F+ and
F~ coiiphage were predominately below detection limits;
however, F - coiiphage was detected in 4 samples at low
concentrations of 0.3 to 1.7 plaque-forming units (PFU)
100 mL"^ (Figure 2).
MST markers and bacterial pathogens

Polyomavirus, ß. thetaiotaomicron, and Enterococcus faecium esp gene were detected on 4, 4, and 3 of the
sampling days, respectively (Figure 2). Bacteriodales HF8
marker was predominately below detection limits with
only two detects at (5 and 3 GEU 100 mL"') (Figure 2). Bacteroidales BacHum-UCD marker levels ranged from below
detection to 407 GEU 100 mL~' with an average of 71
GEU 100 mL ' (Figure 2), and were found to correlate
with enterococci (CS) (Table 1). Bacteroidales DogBac
marker levels ranged from below detection to 12,900
target sequence copies (TSC) 100 mL"' with an average of
1,700 TSC 100 mL"' (Figure 2). Staphylococcus aureus
levels ranged from <2 to 24 CFU 100 mL ' with an average

Journal of Water and Health | 09.3 | 2011

of 9.7 ±7 CFU 100 mL"^; V. vulnificus was detected on 11
of the 15 sampling days (Figure 2).
Protozoan and virai pathogens

Using the bilayer concentration method (5 L filtration) and
subsequent qPCR analysis, all bather-collected composite
samples were below detection limits for both viruses and
protozoa. However, for the large-volume investigatorcollected composite samples, Gryptosporidium spp., Giardia
spp., and enterovirus were detected on 4, 5, and 5, respectively, of the 15 sampling days (Figure 2). Levels of the
organisms detected did not exceed 2.3 organisms per 100 L
(Figure 2). The simultaneous presence of Gryptosporidium
spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus only occurred during 3
of the 15 sampling dates. Common environmental conditions during these 3 days were rainfall during the
preceding 6 to 24 hours (Figure 2), and sample collection
during rising tide. Also of interest was that during these 3
days, enterococci levels by MF were below regulatory
thresholds (Figure 2). When enterococci levels exceeded
the single sample regulatory standard of 104 CFU mL ',
Giardia spp. was detected, although it was also detected
on days when levels were below this regulatory standard.

DISCUSSION
Properly assessing the safety of recreational bathing waters
is an evolving field of study which will continue to require
further investigation. The complexity of the non-point
source impacted beach system and its components poses a
challenge to investigators attempting to make simple associations between environmental parameters, microbe
presence, and human health risks in order to ultimately
improve beach safety through source remediafion and monitoring. The uniqueness of this study was in the multitude of
different parameters that were analyzed along with human
health effects, providing a wide 'snapshot' of the complex
beach system that may be used to further our understanding
of the system. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
study published that includes the analysis of such a wide
range of varying parameters at a recreational beach. This
is also the first study to measure pathogens concurrently



452

A.M. Abdelzaher et al. \ Microbes and human health at a non-point source marine beach

with human health effects in a subtropical beach environment. The results of this study should assist in directing
future research, but are not sufficient (15 sampling days,
beach 'snapshots') to make conclusions in regards to how
the system functions or which beach monitoring practices
should be taken.
Health outcomes
Average daily excess illness rates for bathers after subtracting the control group (non-bathers) provided an estimate
for the daily health outcomes of bathers during this epidemiologic study (BEACHES) conducted In Miami, Florida.
These daily average illness rates were therefore compared
to the daily average water quality (by analyzing the composite sample made up of water aliquots from each sample
collected by individual bathers). This approach does not
assess the more precise exposure of the bather to the
water in their vicinity at a specific dme during the day (by
analyzing each water sample collected by each bather
during bathing (Sinigalliano et al. 2010; Fleisher et ai
2010). However, the analysis discussed in this study allowed
the investigators to compare health outcomes with a wider
range of pathogens, indicator microbes, and microbial
source tracking markers, which were not available for the
individual water sample collected by each individual bather.
Statistically significant correlations between health outcomes and water quality were not identified in this study.
However, the data suggest relafionships which could not
be verified statistically given the limited number of times
that samples were positive for many of the water quality parameters. The lack of relafionship between health outcomes
and pathogens that could potentially cause that particular
illness may be due to the small samples size (15 samples),
the fact that the pathogen causing increased illness in bathers may not be among those analyzed in this study, the
inefficiency of the sampling techniques (as pathogen concentration and analysis methods may be subject to
significant recovery loss), or that increased illness rates are
not the result of one specific pathogen.
However, a relationship that was alluded to in this
study but more strongly supported in Sinigalliano et al.
(2010), was excess skin illness and prior 24 hour rainfall.
The highest rate of skin illness (15.6%) was observed

Journal of Water and Health | 09.3 | 2011

during the day (May 10) characterized by the highest
quantity of 24 hour rainfall. This day was also characterized by the highest enterococci levels as measured by CS
and qPCR, the highest levels of Bacteroidales DogBac
marker, the second highest Bacteroidales BacHum-UCD
human marker, and the presence of multiple pathogens
{Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus).
The potential relationship between skin illness and rainfall may be due to the rainfall carrying skin pathogen(s),
which were not analyzed for in this study, into the water
column. These skin pathogen(s) (which may include
unmeasured microbes such as pathogenic helminthes
and yeasts detected in another study within the sand at
this study beach (Shah et al. accepted)) may be transported in a similar fashion as the gastrointestinal
protozoan and viral pathogens detected in this current
study. However, 24 hour antecedent rainfall did not consistently result in increased skin illness rates, possibly
due to impacts from other environmental factors such as
fide and solar radiation or due to smaller amounts of
rain which may have been insufficient to release the
skin pathogens presumably residing in the beach sand.
Also of interest is that on May 10, the day characterized
by the greatest 24 hour rainfall, the GI illness rate was
also elevated (4.2%) which is consistent with the detection
of Gl-related pathogens, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and
enterovirus. However elevated GI illness among bathers
was not observed during other days where GI pathogens
were detected (e.g. December 15 and June 21), thus
further emphasizing the complexity between human
health outcomes, microbial measures, and environmental
parameters at this particular beach site.
Another potenfial relafionship that was indicated in this
study was that of F - coliphage and gastrointestinal illness
(detected during 3 of the 5 days characterized by the highest
excess GI). F - coliphage was only detected in 4 of the 15
samples, and therefore more sampling would be needed
before determining whether or not this association truly
exists. Nevertheless, this finding is interesting since F+
coliphage was the only indicator microbe which showed a
correlafion with bather GI illness in the only other published non-point source beach epidemiológica! study
besides the BEACHES study, which was conducted in
Mission Bay, California (Colford et al. 2007). Although F -

Microbes and human health at a non-point source marine beach

(somatic) and F+ (male-specific) coliphage are not the same,
the fact that they both are bacterial viruses and both showed
some (albeit weak) associations with gastrointestinal illness
in two separate epidemiologic studies at non-point source
study sites suggests that these indicators should be further
evaluated. One reason for the lack of detection of F+ coliphage in this study may have been due to sample size. In this
study, 100 mL samples were concentrated for F+ coliphage,
while in the Colford et al. (2007) study, 1 L samples were
used, thereby increasing detection limits.
Indicator microbes and pathogens

Comparison of the different enterococci enumeration
methods showed that results from MF and CS methods
were generally below values analyzed by qPCR. Previous
studies have also shown that the MF method yields lower
values than qPCR (Haughland et al. 2005; Sinigalliano
et al. 2007; Abdelzaher et al. 2010); this might be explained
by the fact that qPCR will detect target DNA from nonviable
and non-culturable cells, whereas the culture-based methods
will not. Additionally, enterococci values by MF were generally below values analyzed by the CS method, which may be
attributed to the differences in the culture methods; MF
requires the formation of a colony on agar-containing
media, whereas CS requires the growth of bacteria in
liquid media. Significant correlations were not found
between these three analysis methods. These findings
should be considered when updating regulations to include
alternative methods for the analysis of this indicator
microbe.
The current study did not demonstrate a consistent
relationship between indicator microbes and pathogens.
Giardia spp. and S. aureus were the only pathogens detected
when enterococci by MF exceeded the single sample maximum (March 22). Piano et al. (2on) observed S. aureus
including methicillin resistant S. aureus in the beach water
and sand at this particular study site and attribute the
source to shedding from human bathers. Abdelzaher et al.
(2010) also observed detectable levels of Giardia during a
set of prior sampling events at this same study site, with
the detection of Giardia spp. only when enterococci by
MF exceeded the single sample maximum of 104 CFU
100 mL '. However, in the current study Giardia spp. and

Journal of Water and Health | 09.3 | 2011

other pathogens were also detected when enterococci
levels were low. These inconsistencies can be attributed to
different transport pathways, and possibly different sources
of indicator and pathogens to the beach site. Although
human bather shedding and dog and bird feces have been
identified as intermittent sources of enterococci to the
beach site (Elmir et al. 2007, 2009; Wright et al. 2009), the
quantities of these sources are insufficient to account for
the persistent elevated levels observed in beach water
located near the shore line (Zhu et al. accepted). The
cause of these persistent levels of enterococci to the beach
study site has been firmly established as the inter-tidal
zone at this study beach (Shibata et al. 2004; Wright et al.
2on). The sources of pathogens have not been as firmly
established for this study site, although limited studies
detecting pathogen presence in sand suggest that they
too may originate from the shoreline as discussed below
(Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shah et al. accepted).
Bacterial indicators were elevated after 6 hour rainfall,
when samples were taken immediately after high tide and
during high turbidity events (which are likely due to the
combined effects of rainfall and tide). This finding is consistent with other studies conducted on both this study beach
(Shibata et al. 2004; Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Wright et al.
2011) and other non-point source study beaches (SoloGabriele et al. 2000; Coulliette & Noble 2008). High bacterial loads detected in runoff samples at the study beach
(Wright et al. 2on) indicate that these indicator microbes
are washed off from the surface of the beach sand into the
water column in significant numbers which could warrant
a bather swimming warning if analyzed by regulators
within a few hours of the rain event. Elevated levels of indicator microbes also occur through tidal washing of the
microbes from the beach sand into the water column, as is
evident by elevated indicator levels after peak high tides at
the study beach during this study and previous studies
(Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shibata et al. 2010; Wright et al. 2on).
In prior studies, pathogens have also been shown to
increase in water bodies after rain events (Lipp et al. 2001).
In this study, pathogens (detected less frequently than indicators, and therefore cautious conclusions should be made
about associations with other parameters), seemed to associate with rainfall as well. However, pathogens showed a
delayed response with rain, and were specifically detected



454

A.M. Abdelzaher eí al. | Microbes and human health at a noh-point source marine beach

when rainfall occurred 6 to 24 hours prior to sampling. In a
prior study (Abdelzaher et al. 2010), at this same study site,
pathogens were most frequently detected during a sampling
event characterized by significant rainfall during the previous 24 to 48 hours (3.3 cm) as opposed to rainfall during
the previous 6 to 24 hours. Therefore more work is
needed focusing on the pathogen response to the size and
timing of antecedent rainfall events.
The findings from this study suggest that the pathogens
detected in the water may not be mobilized by rainfallrunoff processes from the surface of beach sand as is the
case with indicators, but rather are entering the water
column via the rain through a different pathway potentially
through sand/sediment as well. One possibility is that the
pathogens are entering beach water through groundwater
as has been suggested to be the case for indicator microbes
(Boehm et al. 2004). Rainfall infiltration can induce an
increased hydraulic gradient (increase in the groundwater
table) which would encourage the movement of groundwater towards the intertidal zone and ultimately out into
the water column along the shore. Pathogens present in
groundwater could be transported towards the beach
water column under these favorable hydraulic conditions.
Response times of groundwater infiows are generally
slower relative to surface water flow as shown for river systems (Solo-Gabriele & Perkins 1997), and similar effects
could be observed along the coastal zone. Thus, if indicators
are more abundant at the sediment surface, whereas pathogens are more abundant at depth, it would be reasonable to
observe two difterent response times to storm events: a short
response time for indicator microbes (0 to 6 hours) via surface runoff, and longer response times (24 hours) for
pathogens via groundwater.
Unlike indicators, pathogens were also not associated
with either peak or post high tide, but rather were more
likely detected when the tide was rising. A review of the literature studying the exchange of water from the terrestrial
environment to the sea describes that if the density of the
ocean water increases above that of the pore water for any
reason, pore water can float out of the sediment by gravitational convection in an exchange with denser seawater in a
process termed 'floating' (Burnett et al. 2003). Such effects
can occur through rainfall decreasing the density of the
pore water, hence causing a buoyancy differential which

Journal of Water and Health

09 3

2011

would enhance the transport of the pore water potentially
containing the pathogens into the water column. In
addition, during rising tide, a similar effect would occur as
less dense pore water floats out of the sediment in exchange
with denser seawater.
Thus, the results of this study show that indicators and
pathogens are present in the water during different time
periods. These observations suggest that indicators and
pathogens may enter the water column through different
pathways characterized by different response times to rainfall events and tidal conditions. Enterococci was chosen as
the recommended marine beach indicator based on prior
epidemiologic studies at point source beaches which associated enteroccoci levels with gastrointestinal illness (Cabelli
1983). The assumption behind the existence of this relationship is that enterococci, itself non-pathogenic via
waterborne routes, is related to a pollution matrix from
human fecal sources that contains pathogens which are
causing the detected health outcome. For the case of a
beach dominated by point sources of pollution, it is reasonable to assume that the indicators closely track pathogens as
their source and transport towards the beach (e.g. via currents) would be similar. However, for the case of nonpoint sources because of the different sources and possible
different potential transport pathways, the indicator and
pathogen signal may likely be decoupled (Goodwin et al.
2009), resulting in an inability of indicator microbes to
track pathogens thus decoupling the relationship between
indicators and health effects. This potential decoupling is
supported since a relationship between enterococci levels
and gastrointestinal disease has not been established in the
limited non-point source beach epidemiologic studies conducted thus far (Colford et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2010).
Recommendations
The results of this study are intended to guide further
research at non-point source beaches by providing a series
of 'snapshots' of relevant parameters as opposed to establishing conclusive statements regarding associations
between different water quality parameters and health outcomes. This research supports the fact that correlations
between water quality and health outcomes (especially in
non-point source beaches) are complex, lending support to



455

A.M. Abdelzaher eí al.

Microbes and human health at a non-point source marine beach

the need for more comprehensive approaches to beach
monitoring and regulation strategies.
Such a comprehensive approach should include multipletarget monitoring (including the consideration of multiple
microbial targets, measurements of physical-chemical parameters, and hydrometeorologic conditions). Through
further sampling of the beach water quality, criteria may be
developed, relevant to the study beach conditions, which are
based on a combination of targets i.e., elevated enterococci
levels plus positive detection for pathogens. In developing
such criteria, standards may also reflect cumulative health
effects (sum of GI, skin, and respiratory illnesses) as opposed
to one specific illness. In addition to strengthening monitoring
criteria by assessing multiple targets to reflect the nature of
localized conditions, other factors should he taken into
account including sampling in worst case scenarios. Along
with improved monitoring techniques, improved source
prevention of potential non-point sources at the study
beach should also be implemented, including: re-nourishing
sand, treating runoff or diverting it from bathing areas,
installation of showers for bathers to use both pre and post
bathing to limit bather shedding and infection after exiting
the water, developing an upper limit for the amount of
people allowed on the beach, properly sealing waste bins
and limiting the access of dogs and other animals in areas
where humans recreate. More fiexibility should also be
incorporated into monitoring and source prevention policies
to take advantage of recent developments and discoveries
such that study results can be used in a timely fashion to ultimately decrease bather health risk while limiting economic
burdens.
