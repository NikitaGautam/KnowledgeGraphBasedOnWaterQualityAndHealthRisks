a b s t r a c t
Accounting for fecal contamination of drinking water sources is an important step in improving monitoring of
global access to safe drinking water. Fecal contamination varies with time while its monitoring is often infrequent. We sought to understand seasonal trends in fecal contamination to guide best practices to capture seasonal variation and ascertain the extent to which the results of a single sample may overestimate compliance with
health guidelines. The ﬁndings from 22 studies from developing countries written in English and identiﬁed
through a systematic review were analyzed. Fecal contamination in improved drinking water sources was
shown to follow a statistically signiﬁcant seasonal trend of greater contamination during the wet season (p b
0.001). This trend was consistent across fecal indicator bacteria, ﬁve source types, twelve Köppen–Geiger climate
zones, and across both rural and urban areas. Guidance on seasonally representative water quality monitoring by
the World Health Organization and national water quality agencies could lead to improved assessments of access
to safe drinking water.

1. Introduction
Global access to safe drinking water is tracked by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of the WHO and
UNICEF as the proportion of the population using an improved drinking
water source. An improved source is one that, “by nature of its construction, adequately protects the source from outside contamination, particularly fecal matter” (WHO/UNICEF, 2013) (Table 1). This indicator is a
proxy for safety and does not account for actual contamination. This is
a notable shortcoming as ‘safe drinking water’ is deﬁned by the WHO
as water “which does not represent any signiﬁcant risk to health over
a lifetime of consumption” (WHO, 2011), and fecal contamination is
considered to be the main threat to public health (WHO/UNICEF,
2010). A systematic review found that 38% of water quality studies of
improved sources in low-income regions report at least a quarter of
water samples to contain fecal contamination (Bain et al., 2014a).
When accounting for fecal contamination, estimates suggest that more
than 1.8 billion people consume drinking water from a contaminated
source (Bain et al., 2014b; Wolf et al., 2013; Onda et al., 2012). As
such, monitoring of fecal contamination is considered by the JMP to be
one of the next steps in improving global monitoring of access to safe
drinking water (WHO/UNICEF, 2010).
Fecal contamination of drinking water is monitored using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (WHO, 2011). Escherichia coli (E. coli) is currently recognized by the WHO and the JMP as the best FIB for monitoring fecal
contamination of drinking water and thermotolerant coliforms (TTC)
are suggested as an acceptable alternative (WHO, 2011; WHO/UNICEF,
2010). The WHO guideline value for E. coli in drinking water is “none detectable in any 100-ml sample” (WHO, 2011). In the United States, the
Safe Drinking Water Act requires drinking water systems to be analyzed
for total coliforms between once a month for the smallest systems and
480 times per month for the largest. All positive samples must then be
tested for the presence of E. coli or TTC (Federal Register, 1989). Due to
limited resources, especially affecting developing countries, this level of
sampling is not always achievable. Instead FIB monitoring is often conducted using one-off or infrequent sampling, with up to a few samples

each year (WHO/UNICEF, 2010). Unrepresentative sampling timing
could impair the accuracy of fecal contamination estimates in these
areas, as it is possible for FIB to be present only during occasional contamination events since microbial contamination varies with time and
FIB generally do not survive longer than four to twelve weeks (Edberg
et al., 2000).
Of particular concern is sampling during only one season. ‘Season’
can refer to either astronomical divisions of the year (winter, spring,
summer, autumn) or to divisions based on climatic periods (e.g., wet
season(s), dry season). Within the context of this review ‘season’ refers
to wet and dry seasons. Seasonal variation of fecal contamination is an
issue because although water quality is thought to usually be worse during the wet season (WHO/UNICEF, 2010) drinking water surveys, like
household surveys (Wright et al., 2012), are often conducted in the
dry season for logistical reasons such as accessibility of areas with unpaved roads. An understanding of seasonal trends in fecal contamination could help shape guidelines for sampling plans to decrease the
chance of inaccurate and misleading fecal contamination data and enhance interpretation of available data. A known effect size in any trends
(i.e., by how much does the contamination vary) could be used to assess
the representative nature of past data if the sampling periods of that
data are also known. While previous studies have shown that water
quality parameters in surface waters (Ouyang et al., 2006) as well as
some unimproved drinking water sources in developing countries
(Wright, 1986) follow seasonal patterns, no review has been conducted
on the general seasonal trend of fecal contamination in improved drinking water source types in developing countries.
The aim of this study is to systematically review studies on seasonal
variation in fecal contamination of improved sources of drinking water
in developing countries with a view to better understanding the prevailing (seasonal) trends.
2. Methods
This analysis of studies reporting seasonal variation (e.g., rainfall
season) in fecal contamination of improved drinking water sources in
developing countries was based on a systematic review published elsewhere (Bain et al., 2014a). This systematic review was conducted in adherence with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), a set of guidelines designed to improve
reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Moher et al., 2009).
2.1. Data sources
Studies relevant to the topic of seasonal variation in contamination
were retrieved from Bain et al. (2014a), which examined fecal contamination (TTC and E. coli) of drinking water at the point of collection (i.e.,
water sampled directly at the water source) in developing countries and
created a drinking water quality database of 319 studies. The search
method and inclusion criteria for the study are published elsewhere
(Bain et al., 2014a).
Studies were included in this review provided they: were written in
English; separately reported on sources that could be classiﬁed as

Included

‘improved’ according to the JMP; assessed drinking water at the point of
collection for FIB; included temporal data either by season or by month
that could be matched to rainfall seasons; provided either a written
ﬁnding (e.g., a sentence on variation written in the article) on variation
and/or extractable quantitative data for more than one season; did not
include an intervention on water quality (e.g., water treatment) during
the course of sample collection; and did not take place following an
emergency or natural disaster.
The following information was extracted from each study: city or region; country; source type; indicator bacteria; type of water quality
measurement (either concentration of indicator bacteria or percentage
of positive samples); population setting (rural or urban); and all relevant quantitative data (including mean CFU/100 ml or percentage of
positive samples by season).
Findings about fecal contamination of drinking water by season
(greater in the wet season, greater in the dry season, no change by season) were extracted from each study. It was noted whether or not the
author(s) included a statistical test for the signiﬁcance of each ﬁnding
from their study and, if so, whether or not the ﬁndings were signiﬁcant.
If seasons were deﬁned by astronomical seasons, these were matched to
climatic rainfall seasons using the Köppen–Geiger climate zones (Kottek
et al., 2006).
If a study reported a ﬁnding for more than one improved source
type, each ﬁnding was recorded as a separate entry. If a study used
more than one combination of FIB and method of quality measurement
each combination was entered as a separate ﬁnding.
Findings were clustered into four ‘indicator-measurement’ groups
according to the type of quality measurement (proportion of samples
positive or concentration per 100 ml) and FIB used (E. coli or TTC).
This grouping enables comparability of results as TTC is a less speciﬁc indicator of contamination than E. coli (Payment et al., 2003) and the two
types of measurement of contamination (FIB concentration vs presence/

absence of the indicator) may be differentially affected by seasonal
variation.
2.2. Analysis
To determine climatic regions, all included studies were mapped
using ArcGIS and superposed on a Köppen–Geiger Climate Classiﬁcation
System GIS layer (Kottek et al., 2006). The ﬁndings (including reported
signiﬁcance) were tallied in the following ways: all ﬁndings; by
indicator-measurement groups; by population setting, by source type;
and by climatic region. Differences in number found between wet and
dry seasons were tested for signiﬁcance using the Chi-squared goodness
of ﬁt test and Fisher's exact test.
3. Results
3.1. Search results and study characteristics
The screening process used for this review is shown in Fig. 1. Of the
319 studies identiﬁed in Bain et al. (2014a), 67 studies were initially
identiﬁed as having examined fecal contamination of drinking water
over the course of more than one season based on their title and abstract. Of these, 45 were excluded for failure to meet inclusion criteria.
Thus, 22 studies were included in this review.
The 22 reviewed studies included seven studies that used multiple
indicator bacteria and/or quality measurement methods resulting in
33 separate evaluations of water quality. These 33 evaluations produced
49 ﬁndings as 16 evaluations produced more than one ﬁnding each by
disaggregating their analysis by water source type. Table 2 lists the characteristics of studies included in this review.
Findings came from ﬁve Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
regions: Southern Asia (n = 26), Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 15),

the dry season. The differences in number of each ﬁnding were signiﬁcant (Chi-square goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001).

3.3. By statistical signiﬁcance
Statistical signiﬁcance was reported in 57% (n = 26) of ﬁndings. Of
these, 21 reported their ﬁndings to be statistically signiﬁcant. Among
the 21 statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings, 71% (n = 15) found greater
fecal contamination in the wet season, 29% (n = 6) found no change
in fecal contamination between seasons and there were no reports of
greater contamination in the dry season that were statistically signiﬁcant. This trend in the ﬁndings was statistically signiﬁcant (Chi-square
goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001).
We compared studies reporting a test of signiﬁcance with those that
did not (43%, n = 20). A Fisher's exact test showed that there was no
signiﬁcant difference between the distributions of ﬁndings in these
groups. A statistically signiﬁcant trend of greater contamination during
the wet season was also found in the studies that did not report a test of
signiﬁcance (Chi-square goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001).

3.4. By ‘indicator-measurement’ groups
A similar trend found in the overall ﬁndings was also found in each
of the four ‘indicator-measurement’ groups (Fig. 3). Between 67 and
90% of the ﬁndings in each group reported greater fecal contamination
in the wet season as compared to the dry season. This trend was significant in each group (Chi-square goodness of ﬁt group 1: p b 0.001; group
2: p b 0.001; group 3: p b 0.001; group 4: p = 0.017).
The proportion of ﬁndings by group that reported no change in fecal
contamination and the proportion that reported greater fecal contamination in the dry season both ranged from 0 to 33%. Authors of between
33 and 60% of ﬁndings in each group did not report on the signiﬁcance
of their ﬁndings. There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups
1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fisher's exact p = 0.132).

3.5. By population setting
There were 72% (n = 33) of ﬁndings drawn from studies located in
rural settings while 28% (n = 13) of ﬁndings were drawn from studies
in urban settings. There was a signiﬁcant relationship between setting
and contamination ﬁnding (Fisher's exact p = 0.001) (Fig. 4).
There was a signiﬁcant trend of greater contamination during the
wet season in both rural and urban ﬁndings, though the trend was
stronger in rural ﬁndings (Binomial test p b 0.001 and Chi-square goodness of ﬁt p = 0.044, respectively). Of the 33 rural ﬁndings, 91% (n =
30) found greater fecal contamination in the wet season and 9% (n =
3) of ﬁndings found no change in contamination. Of the 13 urban ﬁndings, 46% (n = 6) found greater fecal contamination in the wet season,
23% (n = 3) found greater fecal contamination in the dry season, and
31% (n = 4) found no change in contamination.
3.6. By source type
For boreholes (p b 0.001), piped systems (p b 0.001) and rainwater
(p b 0.001) a Chi-square goodness of ﬁt test showed a signiﬁcant
trend of greater contamination during the wet season (Fig. 5). All rainwater collection ﬁndings (n = 12) showed greater contamination in
the wet season. The remaining two source types (protected wells and
bottled water) were represented in an insufﬁcient number of studies
to conduct statistical analysis (n = 3 and n = 1, respectively). Fisher's
exact test showed no signiﬁcant differences in ﬁndings between source
types.
3.7. By climate zone
Studies were located in nine climate zones. There were 38 ﬁndings
drawn from study sites that had some form of Equatorial climate (Equatorial = ‘A’ in the Köppen–Geiger system). Of these, 23 were from the
Equatorial, dry-winter (Aw) climate zone. Six were from Equatorial,
monsoonal (Am) and Equatorial, fully humid (Af) and 10 came from

study locations that spanned several climate zones, at least one of which
was Equatorial. The remaining eight ﬁndings came from arid (B), warm
temperature (C) and snow (D) climate zones.
There was a signiﬁcant trend of greater contamination in the wet
season in climate region ‘Aw’ (Chi-square goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001)
(Fig. 6). The same trend held true when all ﬁndings from exclusively
Equatorial zones (Aw, Am and Af) were combined (Chi-square goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001) and also when the additional 10 ﬁndings that included at least one Equatorial climate region were included (Chisquare goodness of ﬁt p b 0.001).
The remaining climate zones (C, B, and D) had an insufﬁcient number of ﬁndings for statistical analysis.

3.8. Quantitative analysis
There were 30 ﬁndings that were accompanied by extractable quantitative data on the concentration of FIB. Data were reported in a variety
of ways (e.g., some as mean CFU/100 ml, some as maximum and minimum CFU/100 ml), making the set of data, as a whole, unsuitable for
quantitative comparison. Thirteen of the 30 ﬁndings, however, reported
on mean CFU/100 ml though only two also reported on either standard
error or standard deviation. With these limited statistical characteristics
a meta-analysis was not possible, but a plot of absolute differences in
seasonal means is displayed in Fig. 7 and an equivalent plot normalized
by the average contamination level in the two seasons is illustrated in

Fig. 8. The latter shows that in general mean contamination is approximately 50 to 200% higher in the wet season. There were 12 of 32 ﬁndings that provided quantitative data on the average proportion of
contaminated samples in both seasons. Differences in the seasonal average proportions of contamination are provided in Fig. 9. In two studies
(Taylor et al., 2012; Yassin et al., 2006) a higher proportion of positive
samples were observed in the dry season but in both cases these ﬁndings were not found to be signiﬁcant and the difference was small
(b5%).
4. Discussion
In the great majority of studies, fecal contamination is more often
detected and found at higher concentrations during the wet season.
This trend was present in all ways the data were tallied: as a whole;
by signiﬁcance; by indicator-measurement grouping; by population
setting; by source type; and by climate zone. This is consistent with
the understanding that microbial contamination varies with time
(Edberg et al., 2000) and conﬁrms the widely accepted perception
that fecal contamination is generally greater in the wet season (WHO/
UNICEF, 2010) to be a real and signiﬁcant pattern of variation. The direction of variation found and generalizability of the trend ﬁts with existing
literature on seasonal variation of contamination in other water sources
(Ouyang et al., 2006; Wright, 1986; Wu et al., 2011).

The trend also coincides with seasonal patterns in health outcomes
that are themselves associated with drinking fecally contaminated
water. Associated health outcomes, particularly diarrheal disease
(Ashbolt, 2004), are known to be more frequent during periods of rainfall (Alexander and Blackburn, 2013). Therefore it is feasible that fecal
contamination, a driver of the health outcomes, is also seasonal and
more frequent during periods of rainfall.
With all tallying approaches other than population setting there
were no signiﬁcant differences found between categories (e.g., in the
source type tallying approach there was no signiﬁcant difference in
the ﬁndings of contamination in boreholes and the ﬁndings of contamination in piped systems). This suggests that all represented improved
source types in any of the Equatorial climate zones included in this review would be expected to face greater fecal contamination during
the wet season regardless of FIB used or method of measurement. We
found that boreholes and piped systems that generally provide higher
quality water than other sources such as dug wells (VanDerslice and
Briscoe, 1993; Bain et al., 2014a) are also susceptible to seasonal
variation.
Equatorial climates with dry winters (Aw) had a larger percentage of
ﬁndings of greater contamination in the wet season than did Equatorial
monsoonal and fully humid (Am and Af) climates, which had 33% ﬁndings of no variation in contamination. This is commensurate with the
different rainfall patterns in these equatorial climate zones. Aw zones

are deﬁned by a dry season that is less than 1/25 of total rainfall whereas
Am and Af have dry seasons that are more than 1/25 of total rainfall suggesting a greater difference of rainfall between wet and dry seasons in
Aw climates and smaller seasonal rainfall disparity in Am and Af climates (Finlayson, 2010).
The trend of greater contamination in the wet season was stronger
in the rural than urban ﬁndings. This suggests that while fecal contamination of improved drinking water sources in developing regions is
greater during the wet season in both settings, the trend may be more
pronounced in rural settings.
However, the difference in association may be partially explained by
examining population setting alongside source type. All rainwater collection systems in this review found greater contamination during the
wet season and were also all in rural settings. Conversely, almost all
piped systems were in urban settings and the ﬁndings from these systems were almost evenly spread across the categories: greater contamination in the wet season, greater contamination in the dry season, and
no seasonal variation outcomes. Though we found no statistical differences between source types, it is possible that this was due to low number of included studies and a larger pool of data might reveal a statistical
difference between rainwater collection and piped water systems. This
could account for some of the difference between rural and urban

ﬁndings. Moreover, the impact of residual disinfection, particularly in
piped systems, could not be analyzed due to a lack of consistent
reporting.
Other possible explanations may lie in a ﬁner detailed timeline of contamination. Many studies discuss the correlation of contamination or
health outcomes in relation to individual rainfall events rather than to entire rainfall seasons. For example, extreme rainfall events have been
linked to microbial loading of drinking water reservoirs (Kistemann
et al., 2002) and outbreaks of waterborne disease (Curriero et al., 2001).
Fecal coliforms have occurred in signiﬁcantly greater concentrations in estuaries following rainfall (Ferguson et al., 1996). An E. coli outbreak at a
fair ground in New York state was linked to contaminated well water
and occurred after an unusually heavy rainfall event that had been preceded by drought (Patz et al., 2000).
The focus on rainfall events, and especially the Patz et al. (2000)
study which points out a dry period preceding the contamination
event, raises the question of whether or not studies that show greater
contamination in the wet season are capturing consistently greater contamination throughout the season or are simply capturing large initial
fecal contamination loading at the beginning of the season and skewing
the seasonal averages, a phenomenon known as the ﬁrst or initial ﬂush
(Lee et al., 2004).
This ﬁrst ﬂush phenomenon is commonly studied in relation to
urban stormwater runoff and rainwater collection. In rainwater collection it is accepted that not collecting the ﬁrst few millimeters of rainfall
off of a roof greatly reduces the contamination of collected water as it allows built up pollution to wash away (Martinson and Thomas, 2005). In
stormwater runoff research there is less agreement on this phenomenon. Lee et al. (2004) found that urban stormwater had 1.2 to 20
times higher concentrations of pollution at the beginning of the wet season than at the end and that the ﬁrst event usually resulted in the
highest concentrations. Other studies, however, have found initial ﬂushing to have different effects for different water quality parameters
(Deletic, 1998), including a minimal effect on the microbial quality
after an individual storm (Qureshi, 1979).
Alternatively to the ﬁrst ﬂush theory, the “mud-puddle” hypothesis
states that FIBs are ubiquitous and load consistently into water sources
during rainfall events (Surbeck et al., 2006). Additionally, some studies
suggest that FIBs are ubiquitous due to growth in soil environments,
particularly in tropical climates (Fujioka et al., 1998; Byappanahalli
and Fujioka, 1998). Given that most of the ﬁndings used in this review
came from equatorial climate zones, it is possible that warm soil environments played a role in the observed differences of contamination
levels.



C. Kostyla et al. / Science of the Total Environment 514 (2015) 333–343

Though this review detected a signiﬁcant seasonal trend, the quantitative data from the studies were not reported uniformly, precluding a
meta-analysis of the seasonal variation in FIB. As a result, while the
weight of evidence for seasonal contamination can be illustrated
through a comparison of means, we were unable to estimate the effect
size.
4.1. Limitations
Quantitative analysis of seasonality data is limited for two main reasons. One is the low number of studies reporting on the topic. Seasonality was not the primary focus of most studies included in this review.
The second reason is that monitoring and reporting on seasonal contamination lacks uniformity. Differences in sampling and reporting
limit quantitative comparability between studies. The differences lead
to small numbers of comparable studies, which limit the power to detect differences between and among groups.
Ahmed et al. (2005) reported the results of E. coli testing which appear to suggest that a greater proportion of TTC may be E. coli in some
settings though the limited number of samples means this should be
interpreted with caution; these results were not included in our review
as tests were restricted to an unspeciﬁed subset of those samples testing
positive for TTC.
Climatic zone analysis was limited by availability of data, imprecision in geo-referencing and variation within climatic zones. The seasonal trend of fecal contamination is signiﬁcant in all equatorial climate
zones represented in this study, but further ﬁndings on climate zone
nuances were limited due to small number of other climate zones
represented.
Lastly, the sample size may have been too low for a statistical difference to appear in the source type analysis, which may otherwise have
helped explain the statistically signiﬁcant difference in contamination
ﬁndings that was found between rural and urban settings.
4.2. Monitoring and research implications
The ﬁndings from this review suggest that unrepresentative seasonal spacing of infrequent fecal contamination sampling will lead to inaccurate assessment of drinking water safety as contamination varies
throughout seasons. These ﬁndings, along with the limitations of this review, suggest changes are necessary in monitoring practices and research studies.
Monitoring guidelines set by the WHO and national governments
should include guidelines for sampling timing to more likely depict a
representative assessment of contamination. While this will lower inaccuracy of safety assessments, it will not entirely eliminate the chance of
undetected contamination events.
To help identify unsafe drinking water sources that may be
overlooked due to undetected fecal contamination events, infrequent
direct measurement of water quality could be complemented by safety
management reﬂected in sanitary inspections for community shared
sources and water safety plans (WSPs) for piped systems. Sanitary inspections assess the sanitary risk of sources and their surroundings,
assisting “in identifying potential contamination sources that would
be missed by water quality analysis alone” (WHO, 2012). Inspections
could help further identify improved sources at risk for fecal contamination. Used for larger systems, WSPs are composed of system assessments and design to determine whether a system as a whole (from
source to point of consumption) can deliver safe drinking water, operational monitoring of control measures in the supply chain, and management plans to document and communicate the system assessments and
monitoring (WHO, 2005). Assessing water sources through safety management methods would further inform estimations of the proportion
of the population without access to safe water.
A more detailed understanding of the seasonal fecal contamination
trend relies on both improved comparability between studies and

341

more quantitative data. Currently, reported quantitative data are not
uniform or descriptive enough for a meta-analysis of effect size. Standardized reporting methods for longitudinal studies on fecal contamination would greatly enhance comparability between studies and
allow for meta-analysis of quantitative data. To increase the amount of
accurate drinking water quality data available for future analysis, a template for reporting methods for data and for study quality criteria could
be created to enable information from qualiﬁed studies to be fed into
the JMP. Ideally, the template would require contamination to be reported as CFU/100 ml as this provides more information than reports
of percentage of samples positive for contamination.
Improving water safety assessment is important to the discussion
surrounding post-2015 development goals and targets which emphasize
the need to target the most marginalized populations (UN Special
Rapporteur on the Human Right to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation,
2012). Water safety assessment that does not account for seasonal variation of contamination could misrepresent water safety, and as a result
water safety disparities between communities could be misrepresented,
preventing policy makers from properly identifying areas of greatest
need (Yang et al., 2013).
4.3. Future work
A larger pool of comparable descriptive statistics of water quality
could allow for analysis of the effect size of the trend in variation and possibly a more informative timeline of contamination. With a known effect
size and timeline, research could explore seasonal variation of fecal contamination in drinking water using the principle of Bayesian Maximum
Entropy (BME). BME is a nonlinear, non-Gaussian geostatistical framework for space/time estimation. BME could be used to determine the
most cost-effective times for areas relying on infrequent measuring to
sample and produce the most representative fecal contamination data, a
method similar to that proposed for analyzing water bodies in the
United States and their compliance with the Clean Water Act (LoBuglio
et al., 2007).
5. Conclusion
The review demonstrated a clear trend for fecal contamination to be
more common during the wet season, a ﬁnding that was generalizable
across fecal indicator bacteria, methods of measurement, population
setting, source type, and equatorial climate zone. Since water samples
tend to more often be collected during the dry season, not accounting
for seasonal variation will likely lead to an over-estimation of the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water. Limited
and inconsistently reported quantitative data, however, prevented calculation of an effect size for the trend. While these results illustrate
that contamination varies with season, there is not yet enough information on the trend for infrequent sampling to provide fully reliable data
on annual contamination. Thus, in order to best avoid misrepresenting
safety of drinking water sources, seasonal variation of contamination
should be addressed by both sampling timing standards of monitoring
and implementation of sanitary inspections and WSPs. Standardizing
reporting methods of fecal contamination would improve comparability
of quantitative data in the future.
