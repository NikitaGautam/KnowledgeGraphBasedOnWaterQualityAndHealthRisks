Chapter 1

Executive Summary
The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires EPA to develop, publish and revise am­
bient water quality criteria (AWQC). The Beaches Environmental Assessment
and Coastal Health Act of 2000 (The Beach Act), revised the CWA to require:
“studies concerning pathogen indicators in coastal recreation waters”. These
studies were to include: “an assessment of potential human health risks . . . ’,
“appropriate and eﬀective indicators for improving detection in a timely man­
ner . . . ”, and “appropriate, accurate, expeditious and cost eﬀective methods
. . . for detecting in a timely manner in coastal recrationl waters the presence of
pathogens that are harmful to human health.”
Since 2003, EPA’s National Health and Environmental Eﬀects Research Lab­
oratory (NHEERL), in collaboration with the National Exposure Research Lab­
oratory (NERL), has been conducting epidemiology studies at beach sites to
study beach-goers health and to measure water quality with new and faster ways
of testing for microbial indicators of health eﬀects and water quality. Studies
have been conducted at four freshwater beaches in the Great Lakes and three
marine sites. These studies have demonstrated that fecal indicator bacteria
measured by a faster, molecular approach (quantitative polymerase chain reac­
tion or qPCR) to measure fecal indicator bacteria in recreational waters were
associated with swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness at beach sites with
nearby treated sewage discharges.
In 2008, a meeting of expert scientists [1] called for additional studies at
tropical beach sites and beach sites impacted by diﬀuse sources such as urban
run-oﬀ. As a consequence of a consent decree and settlement agreement, re­
sulting from a lawsuit (NRDC vs. Johnson, 2008), EPA prepared to conduct
two studies, one at a tropical beach site and the other at a beach site impacted
by urban run-oﬀ. In the summer of 2009, NHEERL and NERL successfully
carried out studies at Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico, and Surfside Beach, South
Carolina.
The study design remained nearly identical to that used at the Great Lakes
and marine beach sites. In brief, on summer weekends and holidays, beach­
goers were oﬀered enrollment in the study. Those who agreed completed three
i



interviews: an enrollment interview, an interview upon leaving the beach and a
telephone interview 10-12 days later. The second interview determined exposure
to water and other activities during the beach visit. The telephone interview
ascertained the occurrence of health symptoms experienced since the beach visit.
Eighteen water samples were collected and tested each day for indicators of
fecal contamination: Enterococcus spp. and Bacteroidales spp. using quanti­
tative polymerase chain reaction, and Enterococcus using the standard culture
based method. Swimmers were deﬁned as those who immersed, at a minimum,
their body in the water. Health symptoms studied included: gastrointestinal
(GI), respiratory, skin rash, earache, and eye irritations.
The health surveys and interviews began in Boquerón Beach on May 16,
2009 and concluded on August 2, 2009. A total of 15,726 individuals were en­
rolled. Swimmers reported higher rates of rash compared to non-swimmers but
swimmers experienced the same rates of GI illness, respiratory illness, earache,
and eye irritations as non-swimmers. Densities of fecal indicator bacteria were
low and no single day exceeded the currently recommended EPA criteria for
Enterococcus. In addition, many qPCR assays could not be completed because
of interfering or inhibitory substances in the water sample. These two factors
(good water quality and interference of the qPCR assay complicated interpre­
tation of the health, water quality relationship. As a result of the good water
quality and the interference of the qPCR signal, consistent health relationships
could not be developed between fecal indicator organisms measured by qPCR
and swimming-associated illness.
At Surfside Beach, the health surveys and interviews began on June 7, 2009
and concluded on September 7, 2009. A total of 11,159 individuals were en­
rolled. Swimmers reported higher rates of rash GI illness and earache compared
to non-swimmers but experienced similar rates of other illnesses. Only one day
exceeded the currently recommended EPA criteria for Enterococcus. In addi­
tion, lower levels of Enterococcus and Bacteroidales measured by qPCR were
observed than at previous beach sites. Overall, statistically signiﬁcant trends
between swimming-associated health eﬀects and fecal indicator bacteria levels of
Enterococcus were not observed but some positive trends were observed between
the fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus and GI illness.
Despite successful completion of an epidemiology study at a tropical beach
site and a beach site impacted by urban runoﬀ, several questions have been
raised by these ﬁndings. The most notable of these are an evaluation of the
possible reasons and potential remedies for the interference with the PCR assay
observed at Boquerón Beach.
In summary, at Boquerón Beach despite successful enrollment in the 2009
NEEAR study in Puerto Rico, health relationships with indicators of water
quality could not be established due to the good water quality and matrix
interference with the qPCR signal.
Consistent health relationships between fecal indicator organisms and swimmingassociated illness were also not established at Surfside Beach. This may have
been the result of the good water quality since only one day exceeded the cur­
rently recommended EPA criteria for Enterococcus. Results could also be due
ii



to the lack of human inputs impacting the beach.

Introduction and Purpose
2.1

Purpose

During the summer of 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
conducted epidemiology studies at two beach sites: A site impacted primarily
by “non-point” source pollution or “urban runoﬀ” (Surfside, North Carolina)
and a tropical beach site with a nearby treated sewage discharge (Boquerón
Beach, Puerto Rico). This report presents the results of these studies. The
report focuses on indicator bacteria and health relationships for which previous
associations have been established in fresh water and marine water beach sites.
Previous studies have shown associations between Enterococcus spp. measured
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in marine and fresh waters
and Bacteroidales spp. measured by qPCR in marine waters [2, 3, ?].

2.2

Background

Fecal indicator bacteria in recreational waters can indicate the potential pres­
ence of a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms which are infectious in hu­
mans, resulting in gastrointestinal and other symptoms. As early as the 1950s,
studies observed associations with the occurrence of high levels of coliform bac­
teria and an increased risk of gastrointestinal disturbances [4].
In 1972, the EPA initiated a long-term recreational water quality research
program that examined the relationship between water quality and swimmingassociated acute infectious disease. The ﬁrst phase of the program, from 1972 to
1978, was conducted at multiple marine bathing beaches in New York, Louisiana
and Massachusetts. A direct linear relationship between swimming-associated
gastrointestinal illness and water quality which was indexed by the density of
Enterococcus in the water was observed [5]. From 1978-1982, the EPA recre­
ational water quality research program was directed at freshwater bathing areas.
The freshwater studies were conducted in Pennsylvania and Oklahoma. Rela­
tionships between swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness and two bacterial

1



indicators, Enterococcus and E. coli were observed [6].
Numerous other studies of recreational water quality and swimmers’ health
were conducted in the decades following the ﬁrst series of EPA studies. Compre­
hensive reviews have concluded that the literature generally supports the ﬁnd­
ings of EPA’s studies: that swimming in fecally-polluted water was associated
with a higher rate of gastrointestinal illnesses in swimmers when compared to
non-swimmers [7, 8, 9]. A recently published review also showed that swimmers
exposed to marine water at high levels of several indicator bacteria experienced
a signiﬁcant increase in skin-related symptoms compared to non-swimmers [10].
Several studies [11, 12, 13, 14] observed associations between indicator bacteria
and respiratory illness.

2.2.1

The National Epidemiologic and Environmental As­
sessment of Recreational Water Study

One drawback of the currently recommended approaches to monitor and test for
these fecal indicator bacteria in recreational waters is that the tests require at
least 24 hours to obtain results [15]. Since 2002, the National Health and Envi­
ronmental Eﬀects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) and the National Exposure
Research Laboratory (NERL) of EPA’s Oﬃce of Research and Development
(ORD) have been conducting research at beach sites across the United States
to develop and validate better and faster ways to measure water quality and to
develop associations between these measures and swimming associated illnesses.
Between 2003 and 2007, EPA initiated The National Epidemiologic and
Environmental Assessment of Recreational Water Study (The NEEAR Water
Study) designed to examine associations between swimming associated illnesses
and novel and faster approaches to measuring recreational water quality. Studies
were conducted at four freshwater and three marine beach sites (See Figures 2.1
and 2.2) with a nearby treated sewage discharge in the continental United States.
Over 20,000 beach goers were enrolled and over 2,000 water samples collected
and tested. Results from the four freshwater beach sites at the Great Lakes in­
dicated associations between estimates of Enterococcus sp. measured by quan­
titative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [16, 17] and swimming-associated
gastrointestinal illness [2, 3]. This ﬁnding represents a potential advantage to
managing health risks at beach sites since results can be obtained by qPCR in
under 3 hours, compared to at least 24 hours for culture based methods. Re­
sults from marine sites have yet to be published (papers in preparation), but
preliminary results, which have been presented at scientiﬁc conferences [?], sup­
port the ﬁndings reported at freshwater beaches. The 2008 publication from the
freshwater beach sites is included as an Appendix to this report (Appendix E).
With a few notable exceptions [18, 13, 19, 14] the vast majority of epi­
demiological investigations of water quality and health eﬀects in recreational
waters, including those conducted by the US EPA have been conducted at sites
with nearby treated sewage discharges. Fecal contamination from runoﬀ could
be from a diverse mixture of sources including domestic animal, wildlife, and
treated and untread human sources. Furthermore the nature of sources impact­

ing runoﬀ may be highly variable. Due to the complex and variable nature of this
type of fecal contamination, it can be challenging to make consistent epidemi­
ological linkages at runoﬀ impacted sites. For example, a study in California
observed an increased risk of illness related to swimming near storm drains and
stormwater discharge [14], but other studies at beach sites which were impacted
by runoﬀ or other sources of pollution failed to ﬁnd strong associations with
illness [19]. A study in Mission Bay found an association between GI illness
and male-sepciﬁc coliphage occurrence, but this was based on few numbers of
swimmers and infrequent detection of coliphage [18]
Several zoonotic pathogens which can cause mild to severe illness in humans
could theoretically be transmitted from animal feces to humans via recreational
water exposure including Campylobacter sp., Salmonella sp., pathogenic E. coli,
and Cryptosporidium. However, there are few documented reports of such trans­

3



mission. Most outbreaks of these potentially zoonotic pathogens in recreational
waters are usually attributed to person-person transmission [20, 21]. Recent
risk assessments have indicated that with the possible exception of cattle feces,
human-derived pollution probably has a higher risk than fecal contamination
from other animal sources [22, 23]. Associations derived from indicator bacte­
ria measured at sites with nearby treated sewage discharge have been applied
to runoﬀ impacted sites with the presumption they may be equally or more
protective of health. Some have raised concerns that such studies may not be
representative of recreational sites with impacts from runoﬀ or other diﬀuse
sources [24]. Others have noted the wide variability in observed associations
between indicators and pathogens and raised concerns regarding the ability to
generalize indicator health-eﬀects associations to diverse types of beaches [25].
Few studies have been conducted at “tropical” sites where some have sug­
gested that reliance on traditional fecal indicator bacteria for recreational water
quality monitoring may not be appropriate since they may grow or survive in
tropical soil [26, 27, 28].
EPA assembled a group of scientists with expertise in recreational water,
monitoring and related issues in 2007 to “identify research and science needs for
developing scientiﬁcally defensible new or revised...recreational ambient water
quality criteria (AWQC) in the near-term” [1]. The expert panel called for,
among other research, epidemiological investigations at tropical beach sites as
well as sites impacted primarily be runoﬀ [24].

2.2.2

Research question

During the summer of 2009, EPA conducted studies at two additional beach
sites. One was impacted primarily by “urban runoﬀ” and the second was again
located near a treated sewage discharge but in a “tropical” climate.
The studies were designed to address the following research question:
Is there an association between novel and faster measures of recre­
ational water quality and swimming-associated illness at
1. A beach site primarily impacted by urban “runoﬀ”?
2. A beach site in a tropical region?
It is not among the primary goals of this report to address associations among
water quality indicators or between water quality indicators and environmental
factors. It is anticipated this will be the focus of future eﬀorts. It was also
not a primary goal to address potential other associations between illness and
non-fecal indicators of water quality or environmental factors such as turbidity
and rainfall. It is also anticipated this may be the focus of future eﬀorts.

Site selection
Urban runoﬀ impacted beach site

The following criteria were used to select a site for an epidemiology study at an
urban-runoﬀ impacted beach site:
� Generally meet State or local water quality standards for recreational
beach water.
� Have a minimum exceedance rate of 15 percent of samples.
� Source of contamination is primarily from runoﬀ.
� Can provide raw monitoring data for fecal coliform or enterococci for 2006
and 2007.
� The beach is subjected to a minimum of one rain event per month, and
both rain frequency and magnitude can be readily documented.
� The swimming season > 90 days
� The attendance is > 300 beach goers per weekend day
� Beach is not included in the list of beaches studied under the NEEAR
beach study
� Beach is located in a county with population density > 100 per square
mile

Additional requirements were: variability in water quality, and suﬃcient
population size to conduct an epidemiology study. Unlike previous studies,
which were designed to be combined since they were all located near treated
sewage discharges, it was important to enroll suﬃcient beach goers so the urban

5



runoﬀ impacted beach site could be examined as a stand-alone site. It was
also desirable to have regular rainfall during the summer beach season. Since
water quality at beach sites impacted by runoﬀ is often linked to rainfall, this
criterion would ensure the beach site would receive some storm water ﬂow during
the study.
Previous experience has indicated that approximately 5,000 individual sub­
jects are usually suﬃcient to observe an association between water quality and
swimming-associated illness. Assuming a minimum 20 days of study, enrollment
of 300 beach goers would result in a sample size of 6,000.
The search for a beach site meeting these criteria was conducted in 2007/2008.
Initially, regional EPA beach managers were contacted to identify sites which
potentially met these criteria. From this initial list of 179 beaches, historical
monitoring data and attendance information were requested from states and
local authorities. Additional screening reduced the potential sites to ten. For
these additional details were obtained regarding the accuracy of the estimates
for beach-goer attendance, monitoring data, land use information. The absence
of regular human point-source impacts from septic systems, combined sewers
was further investigated to conﬁrm the sites were primarily impacted by runoﬀ.
Five beaches (three in South Carolina and two in Florida) were selected and
targeted for additional water quality monitoring between December 2009 and
January 2010 with targeted monitoring occurring after a “rain event” (deﬁned
as > 0.25 inches of rain in the 12 hour period prior to sampling).

3.1.2

Tropical beach site

EPA evaluated potential locations in U.S. states and territories (below 28 de­
grees latitude) in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam and South Florida. Eﬀorts were
focused on ﬁnding a beach with proximity to a treated sewage discharge to allow
for a comparison of health risks posed by treated sewage discharge in a tropical
climate versus a temperate climate.
The following criteria were used to identify beach sites in a tropical region:
� Beach waters must be inﬂuenced by eﬄuent from a wastewater treatment
plant
� The attendance is > 300 beach goers per weekend day
� Beach water quality should be variable within local guideline limits

In addition to the above criteria, it was also desirable to select a beach site
which was mostly attended by a local population. Although tourists could be at
higher risk from swimming-associated illness, they are also likely to be at higher
risk from gastrointestinal infections and subsequent diarrhea or other symptoms
from other exposures. “Traveller’s diarrhea” can aﬀect up to 50% travellers to
some destinations [29]. Such a high proportion of illnesses caused by exposures
other than swimming could limit the ability to detect an association with water
quality. Local and regional EPA beach representatives were contacted to iden­
tify potential beach sites meeting these criteria. Local oﬃcials responsible for
6



beach management were also contacted to request additional information. Ulti­
mately, three beach sites in Puerto Rico were selected and were visited to obtain
additional information on beach attendance and estimates of the proportion of
local attendees compared to tourists.

Epidemiologic study design
General study design

The study was a prospective cohort study with an abbreviated follow-up pe­
riod, designed using an approach similar to numerous previous studies. Sites
were selected such that they had suﬃcient variability in water so that relation­
ships between illness and water quality could be developed without a control or
pristine beach.
The goal was to approach and oﬀer enrollment to all beach-goers between
11:00 AM and 5:00 PM. The health survey was administered in three parts:
enrollment, exit interview, and telephone interview. Interviewers approached
beach-goers on weekends and holidays during the summer. An adult (18 years
or older) answered questions for other household members. The beach interview
included questions about demographics, swimming and other beach activities,
consumption of raw or undercooked meat or runny eggs, chronic illnesses, aller­
gies, acute health symptoms in the past 3 days, contact with sick persons in the
past 48 hours, other swimming in the past week, and contact with animals in
the past 48 hours. The telephone interview was conducted 10-12 days after the
beach visit, and an adult 18 years of age or older answered questions for other
household members who visited the beach. The telephone interview consisted of
questions about health symptoms experienced since the beach visit; and other
swimming or water related activities, contact with animals, and consumption
of high-risk foods since the beach visit. Economic and physical burdens expe­
rienced as a result of each illness were also obtained (for example, days missed
from work, money spent on medications). Bilingual (English-Spanish) inter­
viewers were available.
Consent process The study protocol and questionnaire were reviewed by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the Centers for Disease Control and Pre­
vention and approved by the EPA Human Subjects Review Oﬃcial. A waiver
of written informed consent for the enrollment process was obtained and was
justiﬁed by the following: 1) the study involved no more than minimal risk, 2)
potential enrollees would be apprised of the projects purpose and requirements
and will have ample opportunity to defer from being enrolled, 3) only adult
beach-goers were interviewed about both their individual exposure information
and as surrogates for information on their children’s activities (adults had their
children with them to assist them in estimating child exposure, particularly for
12-17 year olds), 4) no sensitive questions were asked, and 5) identifying infor­
mation was only being collected to allow completion of the telephone interviews

7



and payment of incentives. Personal identiﬁers were unlinked from the data fol­
lowing completion of the phone interviews. Contact information/mailing lists
were only retained if the families have indicated that they would like to receive
information about the program or for results of the study. All mailing lists were
certiﬁed as destroyed following completion of the study.
Consent brochure This document served as the verbal consent form and
included information about the beneﬁts of participation (incentives and pub­
lic health improvements for beach users), potential disadvantages of participa­
tion (time), absence of health risk, conﬁdentiality, information dissemination,
contact information for investigators, IRB, and contractor (email address for
project, phone number, and a website).
Paper reduction act The questionnaires and study protocol were published
in the Federal Register and public comment was requested. The comments and
the estimated burden of the questionnaire were reviewed and approved by the
Oﬃce of Management and Budget. The Oﬃce of Management and Budget
(OMB) number for this study is 2080.0068.
Incentives Incentives were provided to participants to encourage completion
of the beach questionnaire on enrollment day (e.g., tote bag, cooler, or beachrelated item). Upon completion of the follow-up phone interviews a 25$ check
was issued to each household.
Eligibility criteria Potential enrollees had to meet the following criteria
1. have a household member at least 18 years of age (for Puerto Rico, 21
years of age)
2. participate in the study and complete the telephone interview
3. have not participated in the study within the prior 28 days. Participants
were allowed to re-enroll in the study after 28 days.
Questionnaire design The beach interview and telephone interview are ba­
sically identical to those used in the freshwater studies, and similar to those
being used by other investigators [18]. Electronic replications of the Question­
naires are provided in Appendix A although the actual format diﬀers since all
information was obtained using a hand held computer. When possible, ques­
tions were designed to be compatible with the Centers for Disease Control,
National Center for Infectious Diseases FoodNet survey. Similar questions have
been used in previous studies of waterborne disease [30, 31, 32, 33]. Respiratory
symptoms have been adapted from the Epidemiology Standardization Project
of the American Thoracic Society and the Division of Lung Diseases [34].

Beach enrollment and exit interview The recruitment goal was to ap­
proach, all beach-goers on study days during the designated study period (week­
ends and designated holidays). Adult family beach-goers were approached for
initial enrollment throughout the day. Interviewers conﬁrmed at least one house­
hold member was 18 years or older and then obtained verbal informed consent.
Further information on family make-up/membership and contact information
was obtained. After completion of enrollment, families were encouraged to visit
project work sites near beach exits when they left, to complete the beach ques­
tionnaire. All contacts on the beach were given either a ﬂag or colored tape
to signify they had been approached. At the exit interview, the information
collected included the day’s activities, food and water consumption and water
exposure (extent, time, duration, and location) and other activities and expo­
sures. The questionnaire obtained individual level information on health status
and characteristics such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, housing characteristics, fam­
ily characteristics and behaviors. Respondents were given an inexpensive gift
(cooler or tote bag) following completion of the exit interview.
Telephone interview Study participants were contacted by phone 10-12 days
after visiting the beach. An adult caregiver, preferably the same one interviewed
at the beach, was asked a series of questions about family members swimming
activities, other exposures, health status, and the severity of any illnesses re­
ported since the initial beach visit. Questions covered enteric and non-enteric
illness (gastrointestinal, respiratory, ear, eye, skin irritations, and urinary tract
infections).
Data entry, management, and security A computer-assisted personal in­
terview device (CAPI) equipped with a template of the questionnaire was used
to collect the information at the enrollment and exit interviews. This device
is a lightweight hand-held tablet computer tolerant of extreme environmen­
tal conditions. The CAPI program ﬂagged missing items prior to terminating
the interview and also ﬂagged erroneous responses to allow the interviewer to
obtain the correct information while interviewing the household. All data were
kept in locked cabinets or in password-protected computers. Networks were pro­
tected with a ﬁrewall prevent unauthorized access to agency networks. Personal
identifying information was stored separately from questionnaire and telephone
survey information and all personal information was removed from analytical
databases. Following completion of the ﬁnal follow-up survey at the end of the
study, participant personal identiﬁers were unlinked from the data.
The phone interview was conducted using a computer-assisted telephone
interview (CATI) system. The CATI system automatically ﬂags missing or
erroneous data prior to termination of the interview. Telephone interviews were
conducted from secured research facilities. Each of these devices reduced data
entry errors that result from data transfer in traditional paper-based studies.

Quality control EPA developed and implemented a Quality Assurance Project
Plan (QAPP) prior to the conduct of any data collection. In addition, EPA sent
a Quality Assurance Team to perform a Technical Systems Review at each beach
to assure the plan was being adhered to and also to review procedures carried
out at the beach. The QAPP for survey data collection (Appendix B) and
water collection and testing (Appendix D) are attached. At each site, prior to
initiating data collection, EPA investigators conducted a “dry run” to review
and correct procedures with study staﬀ. For this exercise, water samples were
collected, delivered to the local laboratory, processed and stored. Sample label­
ing and identiﬁcation procedures were reviewed, as was proper ancillary data
collection procedures. Each study day, an EPA employee, trained in the goals of
the study, questionnaire administration ,water sample collection, ancillary data
collection and water sample processing was available on site to answer questions
from study staﬀ, the study participants, and to handle other inquiries. On site
EPA staﬀ also ensured ancillary data and water samples were properly collected,
and water samples were properly processed and stored during the conduct of
the study.

Illness deﬁnitions
We considered the following health endpoints consistent with those we previ­
ously reported[2, 3].
“Gastrointestinal illness” (GI illness) was deﬁned as any of the following:
(1) diarrhea (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period); (2) vomiting;
(3) nausea and stomachache; 4 nausea or stomachache, and interference
with regular activities (missed regular activities as a result of the illness).
“Upper respiratory illness” (URI) was deﬁned as any 2 of the following:
sore throat, cough, runny nose, cold, or fever.
“Rash” was deﬁned as a rash or itchy skin.
“Eye irritations” were deﬁned as either eye infection or watery eye.
“Earache” was deﬁned as earache, ear infection, or runny ears.
Diarrhea was also considered as a stand alone outcome because it is a com­
monly used deﬁnition of gastroenteritis in population-based surveillance [35, 36].
Participants ill within 3 days before their beach visit were excluded from
analysis of the health outcome related to their baseline symptoms.

Water sample and ancillary data collection
Sampling locations

The goal of water sample collection and testing with regard to the epidemi­
ological study was to characterize the water quality to which swimmers were
10



exposed. The approach to sample collection was the same as in previous years
of the study. Three sampling transects were identiﬁed which encompassed the
majority of the beach site. At each of the three sampling transects, samples were
collected at 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM at two depths, “shin” (0.3 meters)
and waist (1 meters). On a given study day a total of 18 samples were collected
(when all samples could be collected successfully). Figure 3.1 illustrates the
water sampling scheme.
Figure 3.1: Water sample locations

3.3.2

Composite sampling

In addition to standard “beach” samples, in 2009 composite samples were col­
lected. Each study day an additional nine composite samples were collected as
described below:
� 300 mL portions from the 3 bottles collected at points 1, 3, and 5 were
combined to form a shin composite samples.
� 300 mL portions from the 3 bottles collected at points 2, 4, and 6 were
combined to form a waist composite samples.
� 150 mL from each bottle collected at points 1-6 was combined to form a
total composite samples.

Results may be informative in assessing how well compositing samples com­
pares to individual sample results and establishing monitoring protocols. How­

11



ever, in this report averages of individual samples were used to establish health
eﬀects associations and for descriptive statistics.

3.3.3

Additional samples

Additional samples were collected during the epidemiological study but were
not directly related to the goals of the current study and report, and as a result,
the most of the results and interpretation of the results relating to these samples
will be reported elsewhere.
� “Contaminated” sites. Four additional samples each day were collected
near near the source of runoﬀ and treated sewage eﬄuent. These sam­
ples were collected primarily to inform modeling as part of a related but
separate eﬀort led by EPA-NERL in Athens.
� Sand samples. Sand samples were collected at three sites at 8:00 AM.
These samples were tested and analyzed for indicators of fecal contami­
nation.
� Cyanobacteria samples. Samples were collected from the waist depth loca­
tion at each of three transects (sampling points 2, 4, and 6, see Figure 3.1)
at the 11:00 AM sampling time at the tropical beach site only.

3.3.4

Sample collection and processing

All water samplers were provided a detailed training by EPA and Westat prior
to initiating the study.
Sampling bottles were prepared and labeled using a unique identiﬁer prior to
the sampling time (see Appendix D) for detailed discussion). Sampling transects
were identiﬁed using ﬁxed landmarks and GPS coordinates.
Water samples were collected according to establish protocols [37]. Samples
were collected in waist-high (1 m deep) and shin-high (0.3 m deep) water by
serially immersing (2) capped 1000-mL presterilized, polypropylene bottles to
the appropriate sample depth, removing the lids and allowing them to ﬁll, raising
them out of the water, and emptying them slightly to allow approximately
1 inch of head space before replacing the lids. Samples were taken about 1
foot (0.3 m) under the surface of the water in waist-high water, and shin-high
samples were taken 6 inches (0.15 m) above the bottom of the water. The
samples collected near the bottom were taken with care so as not to introduce
additional sand/solids/debris into the samples. GPS coordinates were recorded
at the location of each sample.
Following collection, all samples were placed in coolers and maintained on
ice during transport and at 1 - 4�during the time interval before they were
analyzed or shipped.

Ancillary data collection

The measurements shown in Table 3.1 were collected at each sampling time (8:00
AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM). The measures collected included date, time, geo­
graphical position (latitude and longitude) air temperature, water temperature,
cloud cover, ultra violet radiation (UV), rainfall, wind speed, wind direction,
water current direction, wave height, bather density, number of boats, num­
ber of animals/birds, debris presence, pH, and turbidity. Additional detail is

Water sample analysis

Water samples were analyzed for the following indicators of fecal contamination:
� Enterococcus by EPA Method 1600 [38]
� Enterococcus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [16, 17]
� Bacteroidales by qPCR [17]

Water samples were analyzed for Enterococcus by Method 1600 using 100,
10, and 1 ml volumes. Results were converted to CFU per 100 ml equivalents.
The best count was selected according to a standard operating procedure shown
in Appendix C. Analysis of samples by Method 1600 was begun within 6 hours of
collection, and the ﬁltration and plating was completed within 8 hours of collec­
tion. Samples were ﬁltered through 0.4 µm polycarbonate membrane ﬁlters for
qPCR analysis within 6 hours of collection, and the QPCR ﬁlters were frozen
at a minimum of -20 � and sent on dry ice by overnight express to EMSL
Analytical, Inc. (Westmont, New Jersey) for Enterococcus and Bacteroidales
quantiﬁcation. See Appendix D for discussion of quality control measures.
No additional samples were collected for the determination of pH and turbid­
ity. These measurements were made from the same samples used for membrane
ﬁltration after these analyses were completed to prevent contamination.
An additional set of ﬁlters were sent to USEPA NERL laboratories in Cincin­
nati where additional qPCR analyses were conducted for Clostridia spp. [39]
and E. coli (unpublished) and human speciﬁc Bacteroidales markers. Testing
and analyses for these indicators were prioritized separately since health rela­
tionships in fresh or marine waters have not been previously established.

3.4.1

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction

The details of the qPCR assay used in this study including primer and probe
sequences have been previously described [16, 17, 40]. In brief, the ﬁlter samples
were extracted to recover total DNA and the DNA extracts were subjected to
qPCR analysis by the basic procedures described previously [16]. Brieﬂy, cells
were suspended from the ﬁlters and lysed in a bead mill (BioSpec, Bartlesville,
OK) for 60 seconds at maximum speed and the debris were removed by cen­
trifugation. The published DNA extraction procedure was modiﬁed slightly by
increasing the total volume of extraction buﬀer, containing 0.2 µg/mL salmon
sperm DNA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in AE buﬀer (Qiagen,Valencia, CA) from
0.3 ml to 0.6 ml and decreasing the dilution of recovered supernatants prior to
analysis from 10-fold to 5-fold.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation of a speciﬁc DNA sequence
was carried out using the TaqMan PCR product detection system. The reactions
were performed in a thermal cycling instrument (Smart-Cycler System, Cepheid,
Sunnyvale, CA) that automated the detection and quantitative measurement
of the ﬂuorescent signals produced by probe degradation during each cycle of
ampliﬁcation.
15



Salmon testes DNA was added to the extraction buﬀer as a source of ref­
erence target sequences to estimate the relative eﬃciency of total DNA recov­
ery from the water sample ﬁlters compared to the calibrator samples. Cycle
Threshold (CT) values from the qPCR assay for these sequences were also used
to identify potential PCR inhibition caused by the water ﬁlter extracts [41].
Five-fold dilutions of the water ﬁlter and calibration sample extracts were rou­
tinely analyzed and water ﬁlter extracts giving salmon DNA assay CT values
that were > 3 CT units higher than the mean values from the calibration ex­
tracts were reanalyzed after additional 5-fold dilutions. Salmon DNA assays
were performed in separate reaction tubes.
Calibrator samples (six replicates), consisting of clean polycarbonate ﬁlters
amended with known cell quantities of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC# 29212)
and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (ATCC# 29741), and negative control sam­
ples (six replicates), consisting of clean ﬁlters only, were extracted in the same
manner with each batch of test samples. Cells used in the calibrator samples
originated from laboratory grown cultures and were enumerated as previously
described [16, 17].
Estimation of Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Estimates of qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) were based on the Com­
parative Cycle Threshold Method [42], consistent with previous publications
[3, 2, 16, 17, 40] qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) were determined
using only test sample and average batch calibration sample target organism
assay CT values (“delta-CT”) [17] and also after corrections using CT values
from the salmon reference assays (“delta delta-CT”) [3, 2, 16, 17].
The delta-delta CT computational approach is derived from the compara­
tive cycle threshold (CT) method [42]. This approach employs an arithmetic
formula to determine the ratio of target sequence quantities in DNA extracts
from test sample ﬁlters relative to those in similarly-prepared DNA extracts
from calibrator sample ﬁlters containing a known quantity of target organism
cells based on the diﬀerence in CT values obtained from qPCR analyses of these
samples. Similar comparisons of CT values from qPCR assays for an exogenous
target sequence from salmon sperm DNA, added in equal quantities to both the
test and calibrator sample ﬁlters before DNA extraction, were used both as a
reference to normalize results for diﬀerences in the amount of total DNA recov­
ered from each sample (e.g., caused by test sample eﬀects on DNA recovery)
and as a sample processing control (SPC) to signal potentially non-quantiﬁable
test sample results caused by PCR inhibition or low DNA recoveries[16]. The
calculation can be expressed by the following equations:
CTΔ,Δ = ΔCT,target − ΔCT,ref

(3.1)

CCEΔ,Δ = Ncalibrator × A−CTΔ,Δ

(3.2)

and

16



where:
� ΔCT,target is the diﬀerence between the CT from the sample target (e.g.,
Enterococcus and the average CT of the batch calibrator
� ΔCT,ref is the corresponding diﬀerence for the salmon sperm reference
sequence
� Ncalibrator is the known number of cells in the calibrator sample
� A is the ampliﬁcation factor for the assay.

Ideally A=2 but typically it is in the range 1.9 2.0 with values less than 2
resulting from less than 100% replication of the target sequence at each cycle.
In practice, A is either assumed to be 2 or is estimated based on the slope of a
standard curve[42]. For both the Enterococcus and Bacteroidales assays, values
for A were assumed to be 2 because this value was within the 95% conﬁdence
intervals of the slope values obtained by the laboratory from repeated qPCR
analyses of serially diluted genomic DNA standards.
For the delta-CT calculation, the ΔCT,ref above is excluded from the cal­
culation and the salmon assay is used as a pass-fail control.
See previous manuscripts [17, 16, 40] for a more detalied discussion and de­
scription of these calculations. The delta delta-CT calculation provides quan­
titative adjustment for partial inhibition [40, 16], but there is some evidence
that the salmon reference assay may over correct the CCE quantitation due
to a higher sensitivity to matrix inhibitory eﬀects whereas delta-CT may lead
to underestimations [17]. Therefore, both calculation methods were used to
determine whether health eﬀects associations substantially aﬀected by the cal­
culation approach used. For both approaches, if samples failed the salmon CT
criterion described above even after 5-fold dilution, the sample was considered
potentially signiﬁcantly inhibitory [40] and results were replaced with mean of
valid samples collected at the same location, depth and time.
The lower detection limit was deﬁned as the upper 95% CT bound of the
pooled standard curve data that was generated from repeated analyses of seri­
ally diluted genomic DNA extracts from the calibrator bacterial strains during
the study period. Target sequence concentrations in these genomic DNA ex­
tracts were determined as previously described [40]. CT values were restricted
at this upper bound for all CCE calculations. Unless otherwise indicated, onehalf the calculated CCE was used for non-detects where there was no detection
after 45 cycles. Previously, we compared several diﬀerent approaches to as­
sign values for these samples [3] and demonstrated the associations with illness
were not strongly aﬀected by the approach used. We again used several ap­
proaches for these values including using one-half the estimated detection limit,
a maximum-likelihood estimate, and a regression on order statistics estimate.
The purpose for applying several approaches was to determine to what extent, if
any, the approach used to estimate results below the limit of detection aﬀected
the interpretation of the results. Results are reported in qPCR CCE per 100
ml.

Data analysis

An overview of data management and analysis is shown in Figure 3.2. Stata
version 10.1 [43] was used for data management and regression modeling and R
version 11.1 [44] was used for graphics and preparation of tables and summary
statistics.

3.5.1

Data management, quality and data cleaning

Prior to initiating any analyses, all variables were tabulated, recoded as nec­
essary and examined for missing values and non-response. When possible, ad­
ditional information was obtained to reduce or eliminate missing values, or to
verify and correct values suspected to be incorrect. Duplicates and potential
repeated enrollees within the 28 day time window were identiﬁed by review­
ing duplicated names, birth dates and addresses within the 28 day time frame.
When duplicates were identiﬁed, only the ﬁrst response was retained.
Electronic summaries of water quality results were received approximately
on a weekly basis. Upon completion of the study, databases summarizing water
quality results were prepared by the contractor (Westat, Inc.). These ﬁnal draft
databases were reviewed for missing data, duplicate, accuracy and completeness.
Outlying observations, such as excessively high counts, missing data, high or
low CT values, were checked against the original reports and corrected where
necessary. For qPCR results, all counts were recalculated using the approaches
described in Section 3.4.1.
Water quality measures were reduce and summarized in order to assign ex­
posures to swimmers. Several exposure indices were evaluated, including the
overall daily average, averages based on time, sample location and depth as well
as averages speciﬁc to an individual swimmer’s reported swimming location and
time of exposure. Once water quality data bases were checked and cleaned, sum­
mary exposure indices were created and merged to the health/survey database
by date of interview, and/or sampling time and/or sample/swimming location.
Referring to Figure 3.1 for the sample location layout, swimming locations
were designed to coincide with samples collected from each transect. Subjects
were asked where they spent most of the time swimming. Those reporting
swimming mostly in location 1 would be assigned samples 1 and 3 (swimming
location 1), those in location 2 assigned samples 2 and 4 (swimming location 1)
and those in location 3 assigned samples 3 and 6 (swimming location 3).
Environmental, ancillary and weather station data were summarized to allow
merging and combining with the health data ﬁle. Precipitation from on-site
weather stations were combined to represent rainfall on the current day, the
previous 24 hours (1-day lag), and the previous 24-48 hours (2-day lag). For
measures such as numbers of bathers on the beach, boats in the water and

18



animals in the water, single daily summaries were created using the average
of the three observations. The weather-station data were combined with the
observation data described in Table 3.1 to create a single database with one
observation per day which could then be merged, by date, to the health data
ﬁle.

3.5.2

Questionnaire data

Univariate frequency tables were created for most variables in the surveys (in the
interest of space all tables are not included in this report). The mean, median,
standard deviation and range were determined for continuous variables such as
age. Continuous variables were also categorized based on quartiles, or, in the
case of age, in speciﬁc categories of interest. Race was reduced into a single
variable, which included Hispanic/Latino ethnicity as a category because many
respondents refused to report a race after indicating they were Hispanic/Latino.
Respondents reporting ”yes” to more than one race category were categorized
as multiethnic.
Bivariate tabulations were conducted for most exposures, covariates and
health outcomes. Bivariate tabulations were examined for signiﬁcant or strong
relationships between outcomes, exposures and covariates. Chi-square tests were
conducted to evaluate the association between categorical variables, or when
expected cell counts were few (<5), Fischer’s Exact Tests were conducted.

3.5.3

Water quality data

Descriptive statistics and graphical summaries (e.g., box-plots) were used to
describe and evaluate the distribution of water quality measures. Boxplots were
drawn according to the default settings in R [44], where the lower and upper
boundaries of the box indicate the ﬁrst and third quartiles respectively, and
line within the box indicates the median. The lines or “whiskers” show the
largest observations that fall within 1.5 times the box size from the ﬁrst or third
quartle. Points beyond these values (“outliers”) are represented as dots beyond
the upper and lower lines. Water quality measures were log-transformed to
reduce the strong right-skew present in the raw counts. Regression models were
used to assess the variability in the distribution of water quality measures as a
function of beach, collection time, sample location and sample depth.

3.5.4

Environmental and ancillary data

Principal components analysis is a useful way to reduce a group of highly cor­
related measures into a few components that represent the important features
of the original group of variables. Numerous meteorological and other environ­
mental factors were collected each day at each beach. These factors may be
important determinants of both water quality as well as predictors of health
eﬀects, and therefore may also be important to consider in models designed to
examine the association between water quality and health. Because numerous

19



measures were collected, principal components analysis was used to reduce and
summarize these environmental measures. The two principal components that
accounted for the majority of the variability in these measures were then used as
covariates in regression models. Measures included in the principal components
analyses were: tide stage, precipitation, ultraviolet intensity, wave height, wind
speed, wind direction, cloud cover, numbers of bathers in the water, numbers
of boats in the water, air and water temperature. For Boquerón Beach the
ﬁrst two components explained 40% of the total variation and were character­
ized by measures relating to beach population (air temperature, bathers, boats)
and measures relating to water conditions (tide stage, wave height and wind
direction), respectively. For Surfside Beach the ﬁrst two components explained
31% of the total variation and were characterized by tide and precipitation, and
measures of sunlight and temperature (cloud cover, UV, temperature, bathers),
respectively. Examples include bather density, 24-hour rainfall, air tempera­
ture, water temperature, wind direction and speed, wave height, and presence
of birds and animals on the beach.

3.5.5

Associations between water quality and illness

Regression models were the primary method used to determine the strength
and the signiﬁcance of the relationship between the indicator measures and
health eﬀects. The statistical analysis focused on describing and quantifying the
relationship between estimates of fecal indicator organisms and the risk of illness
among swimmers. It was expected that the risk of illness among swimmers
should increase with increasing exposure to fecal indicator organisms. Logistic
regression models were used to quantify and describe this relationship. The
outcome was a binary indicator of a health endpoint and the primary predictor
variable was the density of the fecal indicator organisms. The swimmer only
model is described as follows:
�
�
p
log
= α + β1 X1 + βi Xi . . . + βj Xj
(3.3)
(1 − p)
where p is the probability of illness, X1 is the log10 transformed water quality
density, and Xi . . . Xj are covariates included to reduce potential bias in the
association between water quality and illness.
Robust estimates of variance were used to account for the non independence
of observations within households [45, 46, 47, 48]. Covariates which could aﬀect
the relationship between exposure to varying degrees of water quality and illness,
or those which were potentially strongly associated with the health outcomes
were considered for inclusion in regression models. These included age, sex,
race, contact with animals, contact with other persons with diarrhea, number
of other visits to the beach, any other chronic illnesses (GI, skin, asthma),
digging in sand, and consumption of raw or undercooked meat. For URI, rash,
and eye symptoms, use of insect repellent and sun block were also included. We
accounted environmental measures by including the two principal components
described above (see Section 3.5.4) as covariates in regression models. To avoid
20



missing data on days when one or more of these measures was not available,
we used best-subset regression to impute the missing principal components [49].
For graphical presentations, adjusted probabilities of illness were predicted from
logistic regression models holding covariates constant at their mean value.
If an association between indicator density and illness was observed among
swimmers, a regression model incorporating non-swimmers was ﬁt as described
below:
�
�
p
log
= α + β1 X1 X2 + β2 X2 + βi Xi . . . + βj Xj
(3.4)
(1 − p)
Where X1 is the log-transformed indicator density, X2 is a 1/0 indicator
of swimming status and Xi . . . Xj are covariates. This model allows a com­
parison of risks among swimmers compared to non-swimmers [18]. The com­
bination: exp (β1 + β2 ) represents the ratio of the risk of illness (in terms of
odds) among swimmers at 1-log exposure compared to the risk of illness among
non-swimmers.
For each analysis, the set of covariates was reduced through a change-in­
estimate procedure [50], where the exposure of interest was the regression coef­
ﬁcient for fecal indicator organisms density. A criterion of a 5% change in the
coeﬃcient was used. The selection procedure generally reduced the number of
covariates to fewer than ﬁve. When data were suﬃcient (at least 30 cases of
illness among swimmers), we conducted separate analysis for the age categories
0 to 10 years, 11 to 54 years, and 55 years and older. The age groups were se­
lected consistent with our previous report [3]. The grouping of children 10 and
under is consistent with the youngest three age groups recently recommended
by the US EPA [51].
In addition to considering indicator exposure as a continuous measure, cat­
egorical variables were also created. For this analysis, indicator exposure was
classiﬁed into 3 or 4 categories based on tertiles or quartiles of exposure. Com­
parisons were made against swimmers in the lowest exposed quartile as well as
against non-swimmers. For Enterococcus CFU measured by EPA Method 1600,
categorical comparisons were made using the currently recommended criteria
for marine waters (geometric mean of 35 CFU per 100 ml) [52].

tical feasibility of conducting an epidemiology study. Critical factors were the
size of the beach going population, cooperation from local oﬃcials and the avail­
ability of parking. Ultimately, based on these criteria, Surfside Beach, South
Carolina, south of Myrtle Beach was selected for the runoﬀ beach site.

4.1.2

Site description

The selected beach site, Surfside Beach, South Carolina, is located south of
Myrtle Beach (Figure 4.1). The beach is directly aﬀected by “swashes” (narrow
channels of water) which receive runoﬀ and discharge directly to the beach.
The Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina is located in Horry County and
contains 2 square miles of land. It is located on the southern side of Myrtle
Beach within the same county. The beach is approximately 2 miles in length
and has many public use access points. There are 12 metered street parking
locations and 3 of them also have restrooms and shower facilities. A picnic
shelter can also be found at the 3rd Avenue South beach access. Lifeguards are
located at 10 street locations. Beach regulations prohibit alcohol year round and
no animal access May 15 through September 15 making this a ”family friendly”
beach. Surfside is in a region with a temperate climate. Average precipitation
for May-September is 5.66 inches. Day time temperatures range from 82�F to
91�F (July).
There is minimal hotel commercialization on the ocean front with only two
hotel chains that accommodate 157 rooms and 133 rooms each. A variety of
other stores include beachwear retail, restaurants, and watersport activities.
Additionally, there is a pier on Main Street with multiple types of access. There
is paid access requiring a payment of $ 1 per person for walking only. There is
also pier ﬁshing access for $ 4-12.50 daily
The beach is sandy (ﬁne sand), gently sloping and open to the ocean. Ap­
proximate wave height noted during the study was about 3 feet, becoming larger
and rough during storms. The beach is well-attended though generally not as
crowded as nearby Myrtle Beach. Typical activities beach-goers engage in in­
clude swimming, playing on the beach, occasional surﬁng and boogie boarding.
It was the conclusion of a report commissioned by the South Carolina De­
partment of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) that many of the
beaches in the region are adversely impacted by swashes and runoﬀ. While this
report did not address Surfside Beach speciﬁcally, it described general concerns
regarding runoﬀ impacts. The following is an excerpt from this report [53]:
A Beach Monitoring workgroup, consisting of Department person­
nel and coastal municipal and county leaders, was initiated in re­
sponse to concerns regarding stormwater inputs in South Carolina’s
surf zone. The consensus of the workgroup was that a voluntary
baseline surf water quality project should be conducted to evaluate
whether South Carolina needs to implement an ocean beach bacteria
sampling program. Results of the study indicated that stormwater
inﬂows via swashes and drain pipes are responsible for the observed
24



high levels of bacteria in surf during wet weather. Recommendations
from the workgroup include the following: Do not swim or allow
children to play in swashes or stormwater. In areas with swashes
or stormwater outfalls, do not swim in the ocean during rainfall.
Educate and advise the public about the health risks of swimming.
Maintain a state/local partnership to regularly monitor surf in areas
with beach stormwater discharges during swimming season. Reduce
bacteria inputs to surface waters from residences and parks. Pre­
vent and control sources of pathogens to beaches from stormwater
discharges and nonpoint sources. The ﬁndings of the workgroup
support the posting of permanent signs at speciﬁc beach swashes
and storm drain outfalls. A voluntary surf water quality monitoring
program, with SCDHEC oversight and supported by local coastal
municipalities and counties, continues.
The beach site and sampling locations are shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3.

Health survey and respondent characteristics

Enrollment
The health surveys and interviews began in Surfside Beach on June 7, 2009 and
concluded on September 7, 2009. The study was conducted on a total of 29 days.
A total of 14,970 individuals from 8161 households were oﬀered enrollment. Of
these, 1,097 households were ineligible because they either completed the study
within the previous 28 days or there was no adult 18 years of age or older.
Of those eligible, a total of 12,553 individuals from 5,835 households agreed to
participate and completed the ﬁrst interview. 11,675 individuals (93%) from
5,436 households (93%) returned to complete the second interview as they were
leaving the beach for the day.
After accounting for probable duplicates, ineligible observations, and those
who did not complete the ﬁnal telephone interview, the ﬁnal dataset consisted
of a total of 11,159 individuals from 5205 households. This represented 64% of
those households initially approached and 95% of those completing the beach
interview.
Note that in the following descriptive tables, any deviation of the total from
11,159 is due to missing responses, except for tables for incident illness where
respondents with baseline symptoms are also excluded.
Respondent characteristics and demographics
Basic demographic characteristics of the enrolled subjects are shown in Ta­
ble 4.2. The study population was predominantly white. There were slightly
more females than males, and approximately 12% were children age 11 or under.
Baseline health conditions and illnesses are shown in Table 4.3. The most
frequently reported chronic health condition was allergies, reported by 16% of
subjects, followed by chronic skin conditions and asthma, reported by approx­
imately 5%. Other health conditions and symptoms in the previous 24 hours
were reported infrequently.

Swimming exposure

Swimming and related exposures are shown in Table 4.4. Compared to our
previous studies at freshwater sites in the Great Lakes [2, 3], a high proportion of
subjects reported swimming exposure. Over 80% of subjects had at least some
exposure to water, over 70% immersed their body and nearly 60% immersed
their head.
Factors associated with body immersion and head immersion swimming ex­
posure are shown in Table 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. Swimming exposure was
associated with younger age, and was highest among those 5-10 years of age
among whom 80% immersed their head in the water. Among those age 55 and
older, only 45% immersed their head. Other factors associated with head im­
mersion swimming exposure were male gender and unknown animal contact.
Those with chronic GI illness and asthma were slightly less likely to immerse
their head than those without these conditions. Swimming exposure was also
associated with less frequent visits to Surfside Beach.

Health eﬀects

Incident illness
Incident health eﬀects are presented among subjects without reporting illness
at baseline. The overall incidence of the health outcomes studied are shown
in Table 4.7. As observed previously [3], GI illness was the most commonly
reported illness, with approximately 6% reporting GI illness in the 10-12 days
following the beach visit. Following GI illness, the most frequently reported ill­
nesses were respiratory illness (5%) and rash (4%). Eye irritations and earaches
were reported by only about 2% of subjects.

illness), Surfside Beach

Factors associated with incident illness
Non-swimming risk factors associated with the health outcomes studied are
shown in Tables 4.8- 4.12.
GI illness GI illness was most frequent among young children (8% among
those 0-4 years) and least frequent among those 55 and over (5%). Other factors
associated with GI illness were female gender, chronic GI condition, unknown
animal contact and contact with other ill people (Table 4.8).
Respiratory illness Respiratory illness was most frequent among young chil­
dren (8% among those 0-4 years) and least frequent among those 55 and over
(4%). Other factors associated with respiratory illness were non-white race,
asthma, unknown animal contact and contact with other ill people (Table 4.9).
Skin rash Skin rash was most frequent among children 5-10 years of age
(6%) and least frequent among those 55 and over (3%). Other factors associ­
ated with skin rash were non-white race, infrequent visits to Surfside Beach,
chronic skin conditions, unknown animal contact and contact with other ill peo­
ple (Table 4.10).
Earaches Earaches were most frequent among children 5-10 years of age (4%)
and least frequent among those 55 and over (2%). Other factors associated with
earaches were non-white race, infrequent visits to Surfside Beach, chronic skin
and GI conditions, unknown animal contact and contact with other ill people
(Table 4.11).
Eye irritations Eye irritations were the only symptom which was unasso­
ciated with age. Factors associated with eye irritations were female gender,
non-white race, asthma, consumption of undercooked or raw meat, and contact
with other ill people (Table 4.12).
With the exception of eye irritations, all outcomes were associated with
unknown animal contact and occurred more frequently among children 0-10 and
least frequently among those 55 and over. Consumption of undercooked meat
and raw ﬁsh were not associated with any of symptoms (with the exception of
eye irritations which were associated with undercooked meat consumption).

All subjects Adjusted Cumulative Incidence Ratios (aCIRs) comparing the
risk of illness among swimmers compared to non-swimmers for body immersion
and head immersion swimming exposures are shown together with the crude
(unadjusted) percentages of incident illness in Tables 4.13 and 4.14, respectively.
The risk for each illness group among swimmers with head immersion is also
shown graphically in Figure 4.4. Skin rash was signiﬁcantly elevated among
swimmers who immersed their body, head or swallowed water. Earaches and
GI illness were signiﬁcantly elevated among swimmers who immersed their head.

Water quality

General water quality parameters (Turbidity, pH and water temperature) for
Surfside Beach are shown in Table 4.15. Turbidity was slightly higher at shin
depth than waist depth, and also higher at the 3:00 PM sampling time. At
least some rainfall occurred on 8 of the 29 study days. Twelve of the 29 study
days had rainfall in the prior 24 hours and 14 had rainfall in the prior 48 hours.
Maximum rainfall on the study days or within 48 hours was 1.17 inches.

3: See Figure 4.3. Location 1 is the left transect (samples 1 and 3), 2 center (2 and 4), 3 right (3 and 6)

As measured by Enterococcus CFU, water quality was exceptionally good
at Surfside Beach. The overall geometric mean of all samples was 3 CFU per
100 ml. CFU declined over time (p<0.0001) with the highest concentrations
at 8:00 AM (Geometric mean=7 CFU per 100 ml) and lowest occurring at
3:00 PM (Geometric mean=1.5 CFU per 100 ml), consistent with what has
been reported previously [3]. Only slightly higher densities were also observed
at shin depth than waist depth. In contrast at the previously studied Great
Lakes beach sites, indicator densities were consistently higher at shin depth [3].
Within depth, CFU densities also did not vary signiﬁcantly by sample location
(p=0.06). Enterococcus CFU densities are illustrated graphically in Figure 4.5.
Fifty-nine samples (11%) showed no detection by Method 1600 and were
assigned a uniformly low value of 1 CFU per 1000 ml for analysis.
Enterococcus CFU exceeded the EPA recommended geometric mean crite­
rion of 35 CFU per 100 ml standard [52] only one day of the 29 days studied,
June 7 (58 CFU/100 ml). A cumulative frequency plot of the daily average
log10 densities is shown in Figure 4.6.

Enterococcus qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE)
A total of 514 water samples were tested for Enterococcus by qPCR. Results
for the delta-delta CT method are shown in Table 4.17 and for the delta-CT
method in Table 4.18. A relatively high proportion of samples were not detected
by qPCR (N=167, 32%), possibly reﬂecting the over all high water quality at
the beach. Very few samples (N=4, <1%) were out of range of the positive
Salmon control assay.

As with Enterococcus CFU, Enterococcus CCE declined over the course of
the day, with highest estimated CCEs occurring at the 8:00 AM sampling time
and the lowest at 3:00 PM (p<0.0001). No diﬀerences were observed by sample
depth or sample location (Figures 4.7 and 4.8)
CCEs calculated using the delta-delta CT approach showed a wider range
of sample estimates (8-109,648 CCE/100 ml) compared to the delta CT ap­
proach (11-30,200 CCE/100 ml) and resulted in higher CCE values (All sample
geometric means of 102 and 55 CCE/100 ml). Both approaches showed higher
estimated Enterococcus densities compared to the culturable method. On aver­
age, the ratios of CFU to CCE were 0.13 and 0.21 for the delta-delta and delta
CT calculations, respectively The average ratios of CFU to CCE are shown in
Table 4.19. A cumulative distribution plot of the daily average Enterococcus
CCE (delta-delta CT) is shown in Figure 4.9.

Bacteroidales qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE)
Results of monitoring for Bacteroidales for the delta-delta CT and the delta CT
methods are shown in Tables 4.20 and 4.21. Fewer samples (61) were below de­
tection for Bacteroidales than for Enterococcus CCE and measures of estimated
CCEs were considerably higher (Geometric means: 575/100 ml and 295/100 ml
for the delta-delta and delta CT methods respectively).
Collection time was associated with Bacteroidales CCE (p<0.0001), but in
contrast with Enterococcus CCE and CFU, Bacteroidales increased over time,
with highest CCE occurring at the 3:00 PM sampling time. Estimated Bac­
teroidales CCE were also higher at shin depth for the delta-CT CCE (p=0.008)
but the diﬀerence was not as apparent for CCE calculated using delta-delta CT
(p=0.08) (Figures 4.10 and 4.10.
A cumulative distribution plot of the daily average Bacteroidales CCE (delta­
delta CT) is shown in Figure 4.12.

Swash water quality
Average salinity at the swash sites (see Figure 4.2) was lower than the beach
sites (p<0.00005, average of 11 parts per thousand compared to 35, Table 4.22
and Table 4.15) suggesting the swash was inﬂuenced by runoﬀ. Swash water
had poorer water quality than beach water. The geometric mean of Enterococcus
CFU at the two swash sampling sites was 224 CFU/100 ml. Enterococcus deltaCT and delta-delta CT CCE geometric means were 2,951 and 7,244 CCE/100
ml, respectively. Bacteroidales delta CT and delta-delta CT CCE geometric
means were 10,715 and 27,542, both considerably higher than measures at the
beach. Water quality measures in the swash are summarized in Table 4.22.
Each of the indicator bacteria measures were higher in the swash than at the
beach (p<0.00001).
Although a detailed modeling if water quality parameters was beyond the
scope of this report, there was also evidence of an association between the
water quality in the swash and at the beach. Average Enterococcus CFU from
the swash were correlated with the daily average beach samples, most strongly
with swash samples from location 2, furthest upstream from the beach site (see
Figure 4.13, r=0.66, p=0.0001).

4.1.7

Associations among water quality measures and en­
vironmental measures

Sample to sample correlations for water quality measures, turbidity, pH and
salinity are shown in Figure 4.14. Pairwise Spearman correlation coeﬃcients
and their associated p-values are shown in Table 4.23. Also shown are Spear­
man correlation coeﬃcients for days with rain in the previous 24 hours and
days without rain in the previous 24 hours (Table 4.24 and Table 4.25). On
days where rainfall occurred in the previous 24 hours, better correlations were
seen between Enterococcus CFU and the qPCR indicators. Also, turbidity was
positively correlated with Bacteroidales on these days, but not on days without
rainfall.
While there were good correlations between the delta and delta-delta CT
calculations, other measures of water quality only correlated moderately. Tur­
bidity was signiﬁcantly correlated with all measures, but correlations were weak
with slightly stronger correlations between Enterococcus (r=0.23-0.24) than
Bacteroidales. Enterococcus and Bacteroidales were not well correlated.
Additional associations between information collected at each sampling time
and the the average of the water quality measures from the same time period
are shown in Tables 4.26- 4.28. Bathers in the water, ultraviolet intensity, and
water temperature were inversely associated with Enterococcus CCE and CFU,
but these same measures (in addition to wind speed) were positively associated
with Bacteroidales CCE. Higher tide stage at 8:00 AM was also associated with
lower Bacteroidales CCE.
Associations between water quality measures and rainfall are shown in Ta­
bles 4.29- 4.31. Whereas positive associations were observed between rainfall

Associations between water quality and illness

The unadjusted incidence of illness across tertiles of fecal indicator exposure
among swimmers and among non-swimmers is shown in Table 4.32. A slight
increase in the incidence of GI illness and diarrhea is evident across exposure
categories. A similar table for the delta-CT calculation is not shown as results
are highly similar.

URI: Upper respiratory illness

The tables in the following sections show the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) as a
measure of the association between indicator density exposure and illness. The
AORs are interpreted as the increase in odds of illness associated with a 1-log
increase in indicator exposure. For example, an AOR of 1.32, indicates a 32%
increase in the odds of illness with every 1-log increase in indicator exposure.
No association, or a ﬂat slope, results in an AOR of 1, and AORs of less than
1 indicate an inverse association, or negative slope.

Enterococcus CFU (Method 1600)
The association between culturable Enterococcus exposure as measured by EPA
Method 1600 and illness are shown in Tables 4.33-4.38. Generally, there were no
consistent associations. Positive linear trends were observed between GI illness
and diarrhea and Enterococcus CFU, but the associations were not of statistical
signiﬁcance. A slight inverse association was observed with respiratory illness
(p=0.04) for head immersion exposure, but not body immersion.
Enterococcus CFU exceeded the EPA recommended criteria of 35 CFU per
100 ml on one day when the geometric mean of 18 samples was 57 CFU/100 ml.
Evaluations of health eﬀects for swimming exposure on this day are shown in
Tables 4.40 and 4.41. There was some evidence of a trend for GI illnesses and
rash which were elevated among body immersion swimmers exposed to Entero­
coccus CFU greater than 35 compared to non-swimmers as illnesses were most
frequent among swimmers exposed and least frequent among non-swimmers.
(Table 4.40). However, although swimmers exposed to CFU greater than 35
had a higher proportion of illnesses compared to swimmers below 35 CFU,
these comparisons were not statistically signiﬁcant.
Generally similar associations between Enterococcus CFU and illness were
observed among children as were among all subjects. No statistically signiﬁcant
linear associations were observed between the incidence of illness and exposure
to Enterococcus CFU among swimming children. Although there was some ev­
idence of stronger associations, most notably for diarrhea and where adjusted
odds ratios were 1.72 (p=0.14) and 1.76 (p=0.16) for the association between
the daily average Enterococcus CFU and body immersion and head immersion
swimming exposures, respectively (Table 4.39). There was some evidence of ex­
cess illness among children on the single day when Enterococcus CFU geometric
mean exceeded the 35 CFU criterion, although the sample size was small. As
shown in Tables 4.42 and 4.43, and illustrated in Figure 4.15, 17% of children
immersing their body the day when Enterococcus exceeded 35 CFU reported GI
illness compared to 7% of children immersing their body under 35 CFU and less
than 4% of non-swimming children. However, this association was not as appar­
ent for children immersing their head 4.43, and ﬁrm conclusions are hampered
by the few numbers of exposed.

Enterococcus CFU, Daily Average Geometric Mean

Enterococcus qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Associations between Enterococcus CCE and illness are shown in Tables 4.44­
4.49 for the delta-delta CT method and Tables 4.50-4.55 for the delta CT
method.
Non-signiﬁcant trends were seen between GI illness and diarrhea and Ente­
rococcus CCE. Associations for Enterococcus CCE calculated by the delta-delta
CT method and diarrhea for body immersion exposure (AOR=1.27, p=0.08) are
shown in Table 4.45. This association was slightly lessened for CCE calculated
by the delta-CT method (AOR=1.24, p=0.20 for body immersion exposure, Ta­
ble 4.51) No other positive associations were observed. An unexplained inverse
association was observed between Enterococcus CCE and skin rash.
Non-signiﬁcant trends were observed among children 10 and under with
Enterococcus CCE and diarrhea (AOR=1.51, p=0.15 and AOR=1.36, p=0.27;
AOR=1.24, p=0.53 for body immersion by the delta and delta-delta CT meth­
ods see Tables 4.56 and 4.57).

Bacteroidales qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Associations between Bacteroidales CCE and illness are shown in Tables 4.58­
4.63 for the delta-delta CT method and Tables 4.64-4.69 for the delta CT
method.
No associations were observed between illness incidence and Bacteroidales
CCE exposure (Tables 4.58 and 4.60). Similar patterns were observed for the
delta-delta CT and the delta CT methods.
Statistically signiﬁcant associations were observed for respiratory illness among
children 10 and under with exposure to Bacterdoidales CCE (AOR=2.95, p=0.05,
for delta CT method) for body immersion exposure but slightly less association
among those with head immersion exposure (AOR=2.53, p=0.11). However,
this ﬁnding should be interpreted with caution since as there was evidence of
strong confounding which inﬂuenced this association. There was considerable
diﬀerence between the unadjusted estimates (AOR=1.44, p=0.42) and the ad­
justed estimates shown above. The two principal components of environmental
measures were the factors which seemed to strongly inﬂuence the adjusted re­
sults. Furthermore, the eﬀect was restricted to comparisons among swimmers.
Non-swimming children had a higher adjusted incidence of respiratory illness
(6.4% among non-swimming children; compared to 6.8% among most highly
exposed swimming children) complicating the risk interpretation. This is illus­
trated in Figure 4.16.

Boquerón Beach

4.2.1

Final site selection

Study investigators reviewed additional existing data and met with local and
regional oﬃcials to make the ﬁnal beach site selection. Based on the criteria
described in Section 3.1.1 Boquerón Beach in the southwest of Puerto Rico
was selected. High attendance at the beach was conﬁrmed by the local beach
manager as well as EPA’s Caribbean Division staﬀ.
Review of existing data conﬁrmed a wide range in Enterococcus CFU den­
sities. Over 58 samples taken from 2003-2007 Enterococcus CFU ranged from
0 to 605 CFU per 100 ml (mean=61, median=9 CFU per 100 ml). Twentyfour samples collected and tested by the EPA in the fall and winter of 2008
showed moderately low levels, but a range of 0-58 Enterococcus CFU per 100
ml (mean=10, median=5 CFU per 100 ml). A sewage treatment plant dis­
charges into the bay less than 1 mile from the beach site. In addition, two
smaller plants, which operate in times of high demand only discharge into the
“mangrove swamp” which connects to the bay adjacent also under 1 mile away
(Figure 4.18).

4.2.2

Site description

Boquerón Bay is a large horse-shoe shaped bay that is open to the Caribbean
in the west. Boquerón Beach, which is approximately 1 mile long, is situated at
the eastern side of the bay. It is gently sloping, shallow, with ﬁne sand. There
water is very calm with very little wave action and as a result wave sports or
wave riding are not done here. The maximum approximate wave height observed
during the study was about 0.5 feet
Information regarding the treatment plants was obtained through discussions
with local EPA oﬃcials and through permit information. The Boquerón waste
water treatment plant (WWTP) is a secondary wastewater treatment facility
which is part of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (NPDES Permit
Number PR0023442). The WWTP is an activated sludge package plant with
a capacity of 0.25 million gallons per day (MGD). Eﬄuent is disinfected by
chlorination/dechlorination. However, the WWTP is overloaded and discharges
from 0.260 MGD to 0.60 MGD during high tourist season (April to August).
The population served by the WWTP plant is 13,200 people.
The two smaller plants are privately owned by the the Recreational Devel­
opment Company, and are covered by one NPDES permit (PR0021326) with 2
pipe outfalls, authorized to discharge up to 0.02 MGD each. These plants are
used by cabins and rental facilities in the area. Treatment consists of aerobic di­
gestions and disinfection by chlorination/dechlorination. The operator reported
that during heavy rain and high tourism, the ﬂow exceeds the plant capacity
and causes overﬂows.
The beach site at Boquerón, locations of the outfalls and sampling locations
are shown in Figure 4.17 and 4.18.

Although tourists from outside of Puerto Rico do recreate at Boquerón
Beach, it is highly popular with local residents, starting during school vaca­
tions and state holidays in April and extending throughout the summer season.
Water temperatures remain relatively warm year round, but attendance and
swimming drops oﬀ during the fall and winter seasons.
A schematic of Boquerón Beach and the location of water sampling sites are
shown in Figure 4.19.

Health survey and respondent characteristics

Enrollment
The health surveys and interviews began in Boquerón Beach on May 16, 2009
and concluded on August 2, 2009. The study was conducted on 26 days. A
total of 19,652 individuals from 8,748 households were oﬀered enrollment. Of
these, 581 households were ineligible because they either completed the study
within the previous 28 days or there was no adult 18 years of age or older.
Of those eligible, a total of 18,483 individuals from 7,724 households agreed to
participate and completed the ﬁrst interview. 16,505 individuals (90%) from
6,877 households (90%) returned to complete the second interview as they were
leaving the beach for the day.
After accounting for probable duplicates, ineligible observations, and those
who did not complete the ﬁnal telephone interview, the ﬁnal dataset consisted
of a total of 15,726 individuals from 6,611 households. This represented 76% of
those households initially approached and 96% of those completing the beach
interview.
Note that in the following tables, deviations of the total from 15,726 are due
to missing responses, except for tables for incident illness where respondents
with baseline symptoms are also excluded.
Respondent characteristics and demographics
Basic demographic characteristics of the enrolled subjects are shown in Ta­
ble 4.70. Nearly all participants identiﬁed themselves as “Hispanic” race/ethnicity
>99%, likely reﬂecting the popularity of the beach with Puerto Rico residents.
There were slightly more female respondents than males and children under 12
comprised 12% of the study population.
Baseline health conditions and illnesses are shown in Table 4.71. The most
frequently reported chronic health condition was allergies, reported by 13% of
subjects, followed by asthma, reported by 11%. Other health conditions and
symptoms in the previous 24 hours were reported infrequently.

4.2.4

Swimming exposure

Swimming and related exposures are shown in Table 4.72. Compared to our
previous studies at freshwater sites in the Great Lakes [2, 3] and similar to
observations at Surfside Beach, a high proportion of subjects reported swimming
exposure. Over 80% of subjects had at least some exposure to water, nearly
80% immersed their body and over 60% immersed their head.
Factors associated with body immersion and head immersion swimming ex­
posure are shown in Table 4.73 and 4.74, respectively. Swimming exposure
was associated with younger age, and was highest among those 5-10 years of
age of whom 90% immersed their head and 95% immersed their body. The
lowest frequency of water exposure was again among those age 55 and older of
whom 68% immersed their head and 54% immersed their body. Male gender

was strongly associated with head immersion and to a lesser extent body im­
mersion exposures. Head immersion exposure was also associated with absence
of chronic GI illness, absence of chronic skin condition, presence of asthma, and
no contact with other ill persons. Body immersion exposure was associated with
similar factors with the exception of absence of chronic skin condition. Body
immersion was also associated with unknown animal contact and more frequent
beach visits.
Due to the large sample size, these statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
often not necessarily meaningful and in many cases represent a small diﬀerence
on an absolute scale. For example, 67% of those with asthma compared to 64%
of those without asthma immersed their head, p=0.006, Table 4.74)

4.2.5

Health eﬀects

Incident illness
Incident health eﬀects are presented among subjects without reporting illness
at baseline. The overall incidence of the health outcomes studied are shown in
Table 4.75. Unlike other beach sites studied, respiratory illness was the most
frequently reported illness at Boquerón Beach with nearly 7% of respondents
reporting such an illness in the 10-12 day follow up period. Following respiratory
illness, GI illness and skin rash were the next most commonly reported (4.7%
and 4.4%, respectively). Eye irritations and earaches were reported by 3.6%
and 1.9% of respondents, respectively.
Factors associated with incident illness
Non-swimming risk factors associated with the health outcomes studied are
shown in Tables 4.76- 4.80.
GI illness GI illness was most frequent among young children (8.0% among
those 0-4 years) and least frequent among those 11-18 and 55 and over (3.9%
and 4.0%, respectively). Other factors associated with GI illness were female
gender, less frequent visits to the beach, asthma, consumption of undercooked
meat, chronic GI condition, unknown animal contact and contact with other ill
people (Table 4.76).
Respiratory illness Respiratory illness was strongly associated with young
age, with nearly 12% of those age 0-4 reporting an illness. It was reported least
frequently among those 55 and over among whom 5% reported a respiratory
illness. Respiratory illness was also associated with a chronic skin condition,
asthma, consumption of raw or undercooked meat and raw ﬁsh, and contact
with other ill people (Table 4.77).
Skin rash Skin rash was unassociated with age category. Female gender,
chronic skin and GI condition, asthma, consumption of raw or undercooked

meat and raw ﬁsh, contact with unknown animals, and contact with other ill
people were associated with skin rash. Over twice of those who had contact with
unknown animals reported skin rash than those who had no unknown animal
contact (10% vs. 4%, Table 4.78).
Earache Earache also was not reported at a signiﬁcantly higher frequency
among young children and showed no association with age group. Incident
earaches were associated with female gender, asthma, consumption of raw or
undercooked meat and raw ﬁsh, contact with unknown animals, and contact
with other ill people (Table 4.79).
Eye irritations Eye irritations were reported most frequently among those
age 20-54 and least frequently among those 11-19. Eye irritations were as­
sociated with female gender, asthma, chronic skin condition, consumption of
raw ﬁsh, contact with unknown animals, and contact with other ill people (Ta­
ble 4.80)

Swimming exposure and incident illness
Adjusted Cumulative Incidence Ratios (aCIRs) comparing the risk of illness
among swimmers compared to non-swimmers for body immersion and head
immersion swimming exposures are shown together with the crude (unadjusted)
percentages of incident illness in Tables 4.81 and 4.82, respectively. Crude
incident illness and the aCIRs for each illness group among swimmers with head
immersion is also shown graphically in Figure 4.20. Skin rash was signiﬁcantly
elevated among swimmers who immersed their body, head or swallowed water.
No other illnesses were signiﬁcantly elevated among swimmers as compared to
non-swimmers.
Although crude incidence was slightly higher among swimmers after adjust­
ment for covariates there was no diﬀerence as indicated by the aCIR shown (see
Table 4.81). This is likely due to confounding of the unadjusted association by
age since young children were more likley to both swim and report respiratory
illness.

Water quality

Turbidity, pH and water temperature measurements at Boquerón Beach are
shown in Table 4.83. Mean turbidity was over twice as high as at Surfside
and a strong increase in turbidity was observed over the course of the day,
increasing from 5 NTU at 8:00 AM samples to 15 NTU at the 3:00 PM samples.
Water temperature was constant across sample time. pH increased slightly over
sampling time.
Enterococcus Method 1600
A total of 468 samples were collected and tested for Enterococcus CFU by
Method 1600 at Boquerón Beach. As shown in Table 4.84 and Figure 4.21,
levels of Enterococcus CFU were low at Boquerón Beach.
Unlike Surfside Beach, where Enterococcus CFU declined over time, at Bo­
querón Beach, Enterococcus CFU increased over time, with highest densities
occurring at 3:00 PM (15 CFU/100 ml, Figure 4.21). Higher CFU also were
observed at shin depth compared to waist depth. Sample location was also as­
sociated with levels of CFU with highest levels occurring along location 1 on
the left side of the and lowest levels occurring along location 3 at the right side
of the beach (see Figure 4.19).
Geometric means of the 18 samples collected were below the recommended

EPA criteria of 35 CFU per 100 ml for each of the 26 days. The highest daily
geometric mean was 27 CFU per 100 ml. A cumulative frequency plot of daily
average Enterococcus CFU is shown in Figure 4.22.
Enterococcus qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Low levels of Enterococcus qPCR CCE were also observed at Boquerón Beach.
Interpretation of qPCR results for both Enterococcus and Bacteroidales was
seriously hampered by three issues:
1. Non-detection, particularly for Enterococcus
2. Samples below the quantitation level
3. Samples failing the internal positive control assay criterion

Analyses at a higher dilution (1:25) only marginally improved the perfor­
mance of the positive control salmon DNA assay and did not solve the issue
satisfactorily. As a result, the quantiﬁcation of many samples were question­
able and impeded interpretation of both the results of the qPCR water quality
analysis as well as the associations with health eﬀects.
Of the 468 samples collected and tested on beach study days, 160 failed the
positive control assay (34%), meaning that after spiking the test samples, much
lower than expected levels of the control Salmon testes DNA was detected (see
Table 4.85). Of the 308 samples that met the positive control assay criterion,
an additional 239 (78%) showed no detection of Enterococcus qPCR CCE. Of
the remaining 69 samples, 26 (38%) were below the quantitation limit (Cycle
Threshold > 37.24), leaving 43 of the 468 tested samples (9%) which met the
positive control criterion with quantiﬁable results.
Using criteria and methods described in Section 3.4.1 CCEs were estimated
and health relationships derived despite the high uncertainty in the exposure
measure. However, results and data presented should be interpreted with cau­
tion.
Enterococcus CCE calculated by the delta-delta CT approach are shown in
Table 4.85 and Figure 4.23. Enterococcus CCE calculated by the Delta-CT
approach are shown in Table 4.86 and Figure 4.24.
Overall levels of Enterococcus CCE were low but roughly comparable to the
levels observed at Surfside Beach (geometric means of 32 and 126 for CCEs per
100 ml by the delta and delta-delta methods, respectively)

Consistent with observations for Enterococcus CFU, Enterococcus CCE for
both the delta and delta-delta CT methods increased over collection time (p=0.005
and p=0.02, respectively). However, unlike Enterococcus CFU, no diﬀerences
were observed by sample transect location or by sample depth.
Ratios of Enterococcus CFU to CCE are shown in Table 4.87 for qPCR
samples which met the control criteria. CFU to CCE ratios were higher than
for Surfside, with mean ratios of 0.22 and 0.58 for the delta-delta and delta-CT
methods, respectively.

Bacteroidales qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Since the same control assay was used for Enterococcus and Bacteroidales there
were similar problems in the interpreting of the Bacteroidales CCE results.
There were fewer non-detects for Bacteroidales, but the overall numbers of ques­
tionable or unusable samples remained high. Of the 308 Bacteroidales samples
which passed the positive control criterion, 116 were below detection (38%).
Twenty additional samples were below the quantitation limit for Bacteroidales
(Cycle Threshold 36.48).
Bacteroidales CCE by the delta-delta CT approach are shown in Table 4.88
and Figure 4.26. Enterococcus CCE calculated by the delta CT approach are
shown in Table 4.89 and Figure 4.27.
Overall geometric means for Bacteroidales CCE were 288 CCE per 100 ml for
the delta-CT calculation and 1,097 for the delta-delta CCE calculation. Like
Enterococcus CCE, Bacteroidales CCE increased over time (p<0.0005), with
highest CCEs at the 3:00 PM sampling time, and lowest at 8:00 AM (Figure 4.26
and 4.27). As observed with Enterococcus CCE, Bacteroidales CCE were highest
at swimming location 1 (p=0.04, for both delta and delta-delta CT).
A cumulative distribution plot of the daily average Bacteroidales CCE (delta­
delta CT) is shown in Figure 4.28.

1: Number of samples passing salmon criteria with no detection after 45 cycles
2: Number of samples where salmon assay fails cycle threshold criterion (see Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4)
3: See Figure 4.19. Location 1 is left transect (samples 1 and 3), 2 center (2 and 4), 3 right (3 and 6)

lagoon also had very low levels of fecal indicators (see Fig 4.18). The geomet­
ric mean of Enterococcus CFU near the sewage treatment plant discharge was
nearly the same as the beach sites (geometric mean=5 CFU per 100 ml). . De­
spite low levels of contamination at the mangrove swamp (Geometric mean=1
CFU per 100 ml), Enterococcus CFU measured at the swamp were associated
with levels of Enterococcus CFU at the beach, with the strongest associations
occurring at a lag of one day (see Figure 4.29). Enterococcus CFU at the dis­
charge from the sewage treatment plant, however, were not associated with
Enterococcus CFU at the beach (data not shown).

Associations among water quality and environmen­
tal measures

Sample to sample correlations for water quality measures, turbidity, pH and
salinity are shown in Figure 4.30. Pairwise Spearman correlation coeﬃcients
are shown in Table 4.90.
Turbidity was positively correlated with all fecal indicator measures, but
most strongly with Enterococcus CFU (Spearman’s r=0.411). qPCR CCE
for Enterococcus and Bacteroidales were correlated, with stronger correlations
within the same calculation method. Interestingly, Enterococcus CCE by the
delta-delta CT method and Enterococcus CFU were not correlated (r=0.037),
possibly reﬂecting the high uncertainty in the CCE results and the inﬂuence of

the salmon assay in the calculation.
Additional associations between information collected at each sampling time
and the average of the water quality measures from the same time period are
shown in Tables 4.91- 4.93. Bathers in the water was the only measure consis­
tently associated with all fecal indicators. such as water temperature and ul­
traviolet intensity were positively correlated with Enterococcus CCE. Measures
such as wind direction, wind speed, water temperature and wave height were
also positively correlations with some fecal indicators (see Tables 4.91- 4.93).
Associations between water quality measures and rainfall are shown in Ta­
bles 4.94. Due to the failure of the on site weather station to accurately record
data for several weeks, rainfall information was collected from an on-site rain
gauge, from the period 3:00 PM to 8:00 AM. Since this information was not
collected during the week, except for Friday, two day or accurate current day
lag is unavailable for all observations, and only a one day lag (since 3:00 PM the
previous day) is reported. Precipitation was negatively correlated with Entero­
coccus delta-delta CT CCE, positively correlated with Enterococcus CFU and
was not correlated with Bacteroidales CCE.

Associations between water quality and illness

Crude (unadjusted) incidence of illness among body immersion swimmers by
tertile of indicator exposure and among non-swimmers are shown for Boquerón
Beach in Table 4.95. The crude incidence rates do not show any obvious trend
or association with exposure category with the exception of a slight increase
in respiratory illness across categories of Enterococcus CFU. Crude incidence of
illness for indicators measured by qPCR CCE calculated by the delta CT method
is also shown since generally there were considerable diﬀerences in qPCR CCE
measured by these two calculations at Boquerón Beach (Table 4.96).

per 100 ml making it not possible to compare illness incidence associated with
swimming on days with geometric means above 35 CFU per 100 ml.
Despite the low CFU levels, there was some evidence of an association with
Enterococcus CFU and respiratory illness (AOR=1.31, p=0.06 for the daily av­
erage CFU exposure and body immersion, Table 4.99). As shown in Table 4.95,
the absolute increase in illness is modest, from about 5.8% in non-swimmers to
7.4% among swimmers exposed to greater than a geometric mean of 12 Ente­
rococcus CFU. Following adjustment for covariates, the estimated incidence of
illness was changed as follows: in non-swimmers, 6.7%, swimmers in the low­
est exposure category, 6.5%, and swimmers above 12 CFU had an estimated
incidence of 7.8%.
No consistent associations between Enterococcus CFU exposure and illness
were observed among children 10 and under. Positive but non-signiﬁcant trends
were observed between rash and respiratory illness among children (Table 4.103
and 4.104).

Enterococcus qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Associations between illness and exposure to Enterococcus qPCR CCE by the
delta-delta CT method are shown in Tables 4.105-4.110 and for the delta-CT
method in Tables 4.111-4.116.
Overall patterns and trends with illness were inconsistent, probably reﬂecting
the variability in the exposure resulting from the few usable and quantiﬁable
samples (see Section 4.2.6). Illness associations were not consistent across the
delta-CT and delta-delta CT calculations. For example, an association was
observed between skin rash and Enterococcus CE for head immersion exposure
by the delta method (Table 4.114, AOR=1.76, p=0.04), but not by the deltadelta method (Table 4.108, AOR=1.13, p=0.72). Marked inconsistencies were
also observed in health eﬀects associations by sample depth and by sample time.
Examining children separately even presented greater diﬃculties in interpre­
tation as the sample size was reduced in addition to the probable inaccuracy
in the qPCR exposure measurement. As might be expected given these issues,
associations with Enterococcus CCE exposure and illness among children were
inconsistent. An inverse association was observed for diarrhea and CCE expo­
sure among children as incidence declined with increasing levels of CCE. How­
ever, given the limitations of the exposure data, it is diﬃcult to meaningfully
interpret these results.

Bacteroidales qPCR Calibrator Cell Equivalents
Associations between illness and exposure to Bacteroidales qPCR CCE by the
delta-delta CT method are shown in Tables 4.117-4.122 and for the delta-CT
method in Tables 4.111-4.128.
As with Enterococcus CCE interpretation of the illness-Bacteroidales CCE
association was hampered by the high proportion of samples which showed in­
terference or were not detected. Positive trends with both eye irritations and
skin rash were observed with Bacteroidales CCE exposure by both types of CT
calculations (see Tables 4.120, 4.122, 4.126. The interpretation of the trend
among swimmers for eye irritations is complicated by the ﬁnding that nonswimmers actually experienced higher rates of eye irritations even compared to
the most highly exposed swimmer category (see Figure 4.4 and Table 4.95). .
However, the association with skin rash was not evident for Bacteroidales CCE
calculated by the delta-delta CT method (see Table 4.126) where statistically
signiﬁcant associations were not observed.
Positive associations between rash and Bacteroidales CCE exposure were
observed among children 10 and under for the delta-CT calculation (AOR=2.53,
p=0.04 for body immersion exposure, Table 4.129), but the association was
considerably weaker for CCE using the delta-delta CT calculation (AOR=1.24,
p=0.72 for body immersion exposure, Table 4.130). A similar inverse association
was observed for GI illness and diarrhea for Bacteroidales CCE exposure among
children.

Sensitivity analyses

Several variations of the analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the
results. In the above analyses participants who reported swimming exposure in
the 1-week prior to enrollment were included (but this exposure was controlled
for in regression modeling). Below results are also presented for excluding re­
spondents with recent swimming exposure and for various diﬀerent approaches
to calculating qPCR CCE below the limit of detection. The tables below only
show results for body immersion swimming exposure and the daily indicator
average.

Excluding those with swimming exposure in 1-week prior to enroll­
ment
Results are shown below in Tables 4.131-4.133 for the daily averaged indicator
exposures for Enterococcus CFU and qPCR CCEs using the delta CT calcula­
tion. Sample size is greatly reduced by excluding those with prior swimming
exposures, but there are little diﬀerences in the eﬀect estimates.
For comparison with original results, see Tables 4.33- 4.38 for Enterococcus
CFU, Tables 4.50- 4.55 for Enterococcus qPCR CCE, and Tables 4.64- 4.69 for
Bacteroidales qPCR CCE.

Alternate approaches for results below limit of detection for qPCR
Because even at Surfside beach there were a fairly high proportion of Ente­
rococcus qPCR CCE which were below the limit of detection (N=167), some
variation in results was expected with diﬀerent approaches to handle results
below the detection limit. However, health eﬀects associations with qPCR CCE
using the maximum likelihood approach and the regression on order statistic
approach showed no fundamental diﬀerences in interpretation as using one-half
the detection limit (Tables 4.134 and 4.135).

Chapter 5

Summary and discussion
5.1

Overview

This report provides a rigorous, detailed analysis and presentation of water
quality and illnesses among swimmers at studies conducted by the EPA during
the summer of 2009. The primary goal of this research and report was to
describe associations between water quality indicators and health eﬀects at a
beach site impacted by urban runoﬀ and a tropical beach site. The tropical
beach site was selected with nearby discharges from sewage treatment so that
results could be compared with previous studies conducted by EPA and others
[3, 2, 54].
Enrollment and follow up in the epidemiology study was successful. A large
number of subjects were enrolled with more than 10,000 usable responses from
each beach site. Follow up was also very successful with more than 60% of those
initially approached completing the study at Surfside Beach and nearly 80% at
Boquerón Beach. Among those agreeing or eligible to be in the study, 5% or
less were lost to follow up at both sites.
The overall incidence of symptoms appears to be consistent with what has
been previously observed, at least for GI illness (the symptom most frequently
associated with recreational water exposure [7, 8]). At Surfside and Boquerón
beaches in 2009, the overall rates of GI illness were consistent with the rates
reported in previous population based surveys and epidemiology studies. The
yearly equivalent rates for GI illness (both swimmers and non-swimmers) were
1.56 and 2.04 per year at Boquerón and Surfside, respectively. If swimmers are
excluded, the incidence is lower (1.44 for Surfside and 1.41 at Boquerón). CDC’s
Foodnet Survey reported an annual rate of diarrhea of 1.4 episodes per personyear [35]. In a review of of studies and surveys in developed countries, Roy
et. al. [55] found a range of rates from 0.1-3.5 per person-year. One surprise,
however, was the relatively low incidence of GI illness at Boquerón Beach, where
it was anticiapted a higher endemic incidence may have been observed due to
the tropical setting.

173



In interpreting the results, the following criteria were used to establish as­
sociations between water quality and swimming-associated illnesses.
� The water quality (exposure) indicator must be suﬃciently sensitive and
have demonstrated accuracy and reliability.
� The incidence of illness among swimmers should increase as exposure to
the concentration of the indicator increases.

– The above association should demonstrate consistent and predictable
patterns, such as consistency of eﬀect across approaches to calculat­
ing and averaging the exposure
� The adjusted incidence among the most highly exposed swimmers should
generally (not necessarily always) be higher among swimmers as compared
to non swimmers

The last item is technically not required to establish associations with water
quality and illness, but the lack of a diﬀerence between swimmers and nonswimmers complicates a sensible description of risk associated with swimming
and exposure.
Conclusions regarding relationships to health eﬀects should hold for both ap­
proaches in calculating the Calibrator Cell Equivalents by qPCR and should be
robust to diﬀerent approaches in calculating results below the limit of detection.
Also in interpreting the results, care should be taken to not simply select a
statistically signiﬁcant result as evidence of an eﬀect or an association. Given the
large number of analyses conducted p-values should be interpreted with caution
and meant as a guide to the relative strength of the associations presented.

5.2

General limitations

Water quality at both beaches was relatively good compared to previous beaches
studied. Unfortunately a low range of exposure can impact the determination
of health eﬀects associations since statistical power and ability to detect an
association are reduced. However due to the large number of subjects enrolled,
the study likely had statistical power to observe eﬀects of a reasonable size.
For example, statistical simulations of statistical power [56] conducted using
the actual exposure data and observed incidence of GI illness indicated that for
Enterococcus qPCR CCE (delta-delta CT) there was a suﬃcient sample size to
observe an AOR of about 1.4 for Boquerón Beach and 1.3 for Surfside Beach.
These eﬀect sizes are lower than those observed at other marine sites [57] but
slightly higher than the eﬀect observed at freshwater beaches [3].
As shown in Table 5.1 fecal indicators measured at Surfside and Boquerón
were low compared to the other three marine beach sites studied in 2005-2007.
With the exception of Enterococcus CFU at Goddard Beach in Rhode Island,
which had an overall lower geometric mean than Boquerón Beach, geometric
means for all the indicators were lower at the 2009 beach sites. The fecal
174



indicators measured by qPCR were considerably lower in 2009: less than half
the estimated CCE at the other marine beach sites. There is also a variation in
the CFU to CCE ratio across the beach sites. This could be partially explained
by the detection of non-viable organisms by qPCR.

The low levels of fecal indicators were also reﬂected in the relatively high
number of samples where no target was detected, especially for Enterococcus.
Even at Surfside Beach 32% of samples were not detected for Enterococcus by
qPCR. Also at Surfside, 12% of samples were not detected for Bacteroidales.
These were considerably higher than the numbers of non-detects observed at
the three previously studied marine sites where for Enterococcus 10% of sam­
ples were not detected, and for Bacteroidales 5% were not detected. For Bo­
querón Beach, the problem with non-detected target sequences was greatly ex­
acerbated, where only a small minority of samples were actually quantiﬁable
(see Section 4.2.6 for discussion).
For some environmental measures, relying on few measures may not be prob­
lematic for establishing valid associations with health eﬀects. However, it has
been shown that fecal indicator bacteria can vary considerably over time, space
and location [58, 59] and relying on few samples is likely to result less accu­
rate exposure measurement and classiﬁcation, further reducing the ability to
determine valid associations with health eﬀects.
An additional issue not seen in most previous beach studies was the low
proportion of non-swimmers. At the three previous marine sites, 42% of re­
spondents reported body immersion swimming exposure, whereas 72% reported
body immersion exposure at Surfside and 77% at Boquerón Beach. While this
provided more statistical power to examining associations of the eﬀects among
swimmers exposed to varying levels of water quality, it may have reduced the
ability to accurately describe diﬀerences between swimmers and non-swimmers.

Indicator bacteria and health eﬀects associations were originally derived by EPA
[60, 61, 5, 6] and others [62, 54] at beaches impacted by human sewage. These
original sites were selected for several reasons. It was expected the indicator
bacteria and pathogen association would be more consistent at such sites (so
long as point sources were not “small”, or experiencing outbreak conditions, see
[5] for discussion). Furthermore it was expected that human-feces exposures
pose a larger risk to human health [63, 1].
An issue with sites impacted by runoﬀ or non-point source pollution is that
the fecal contamination may be from an inconsistent or variable sources which
may present problems in understanding or deriving health eﬀects from fecal
indicators. It may be analogous to the “small point source” problem described
by Cabelli [5]:
The rationale for the use of guidelines and standards based on fecal
indicator densities for indexing the health hazards in sewage polluted
waters is that, under average conditions of illness in the discharging
population, there is a reasonably constant indicator to pathogen
ratio in the sewage and its receiving waters. Thereby, an acceptable
probability of illness caused by the pathogen can be extrapolated to
a given indicator density, which is then recommended as a guideline
and promulgated as a standard. Such relationships appear to hold
for waters receiving the discharges from relatively large municipal
sewage treatment facilities. However, as the number of individuals
who contribute to the source of the fecal wastes becomes smaller and
smaller, the indicator-pathogen ratio will vary more and more from
the average upon which the guideline or standard is based. [5]
Previous studies at runoﬀ impacted sites in marine waters have had mixed
results. For example, an increased risk of illness was found among swimmers
near storm drains in Santa Monica beaches in California [14] but in Mission Bay,
California, no associations were observed with levels of fecal indicator organisms
and illness with the possible exception of male-speciﬁc coliphage, but this was
based on few observations [18]. Recently a randomized trial found an association
with skin symptoms at a runoﬀ impacted site in Florida, but failed to ﬁnd an
association with GI or respiratory symptoms [64, 65]. Enterococcus CFU at this
site during the study was higher than at Surfside Beach with a median of 19
CFU per 100 ml, though the sampling design was considerably diﬀerent (see
[65]).
Surfside Beach was selected as a “urban runoﬀ” site and had no known point
source of human fecal contamination which aﬀected the site. Water quality
was generally of high quality and only one day exceeded EPA’s recommended
geometric mean criterion of 35 CFU per 100 ml. Swimmers immersing their
head had a higher incidence of skin rash, earache and GI illness compared to
non-swimmers.

176



Positive but generally non-signiﬁcant trends were observed between Ente­
rococcus CFU measured by culture and GI illness. A slightly stronger, but
still statistically insigniﬁcant association was observed with diarrhea. GI ill­
ness increased from 5% among non swimmers to 6% among those exposed in
the lowest tertile to 7% among thosed exposed to the highest tertile of expo­
sure of Enterococcus CFU. Those who were exposed on the single day when
the geometric mean exceeded 35 CFU had a higher incidence of illness com­
pared to non-swimmers (8.6% vs. 4.7%). Illness was also elevated compared
to other swimmers but diﬀerences between swimmers were not stastically sig­
niﬁcant. Among children the incidence of GI illness was more pronounced on
this day (17% of those with body immersion reported illness) but was based on
few cases of illness. No other associations were obsered with other illnesses and
Enterococcus CFU either on a continuous scale or above the criteria levels.
Enterococcus qPCR CCE also was positively associated with both GI ill­
ness and diarrhea, but again the trends were not statistically signiﬁcant. The
strongest association was between Enterococcus qPCR CCE by the delta-delta
method and diarrhea for the daily averaged indicator values and body immer­
sion swimming exposure (AOR=1.28, p=0.08, see Table 4.45). Among children,
the trend between diarrhea and Enterococcus CCE was not statistically signif­
icant (AOR=1.36, p=0.27 for body immersion exposure by the delta-delta CT
method). In contrast Bacteroidales exposures showed very few positive or even
borderline associations with illness.
An unexplained inverse association was observed between Enterococcus CCE
and incidence of skin rash was observed among swimmers. Examination of nu­
merous other water quality parameters (turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductiv­
ity, pH) and other risk factors for rash could not explain this inverse associa­
tion. More puzzling was that the incidence was increased in swimmers compared
to non-swimmers, but among swimmers declined as exposures to Enterococcus
CCE increased. Since it is not entirely plausible that Enterococcus CCE would
be causally associated with a decline in rash, it may be that Enterococcus CCE
are inversely associated with other water quality factors which may cause or
inﬂuence the risk of skin rash.
Respiratory symptoms were associated with Bacteroidales CCE among swim­
ming children 10 under . The interpretation of this ﬁnding was complicated in
that the adjusted estimates aﬀected the association considerably, which was ab­
sent from the crude and unadjusted estimates. This is a concern because the
relatively small sample sizes among children could be producing unstable esti­
mates which are highly aﬀected by adjustment. Because of the ﬁnding of a high
incidence of illness among the non-swimming group and the few numbers of
children in this group, the representativeness of it as a comparison group may
be suspect for this illness outcome. When compared against non-swimmers,
risks are not elevated even among the most highly exposed swimming children.
However, previous studies have also observed increased respiratory illnesses in
relation to fecal contamination [66, 14].
The results observed at Surfside Beach are consistent with what would be
expected from lower illness risk at runoﬀ impacted beach sites compared to
177



beach sites impacted by human sewage. However, no conclusion can be made
on the basis of these data alone due to the high quality of water observed at
Surfside Beach . .

5.4

Boquerón Beach

As described previously, interpretation of results at Boquerón Beach was seri­
ously hampered by the interference shown in the qPCR assay. However, even
had there been no interference there was surprisingly low levels of fecal indicator
bacteria even as measured by the standard culture based method for Enterococ­
cus.
Presently, the exact reason for the interference is not known. In samples
collected during dry runs prior to the start of the study, this interference was
not seen. Preliminary analyses were conducted to attempt to identify patterns
with the samples which failed the Salmon assay criterion. Birds in the water,
turbidity, density of bathers in the water, amount of debris in the water, con­
ductivity, collection time, tide stage, total algal density, and water depth were
associated with a failure of the Salmon assay criterion. In a multivariate model,
water depth, tide stage at 8:00 AM, debris and total algal density were asso­
ciated. A formal analysis of the causes and correlates of the interference was
beyond the scope of this report, however it appears that factors associated with
ﬂoating debris in the water could have inﬂuenced the interference. Although
ignoring the results of the Salmon assay was considered, there would be con­
cern regarding the validity of the target assay results. Some of the factors or
biological processes which could be causing the failure would be the presence
of nucleases in the water which degrade the Salmon DNA, or humic substances
interfering with the assay.
As a result, the health associations with qPCR CCE at Boquerón Beach are
very diﬃcult to interpret and the attempt to draw conclusions regarding the data
reported would be questionable. Although results were presented and described,
until there is is more conﬁdence in the exposure measure it is impossible to place
much emphasis on any associations observed. It appears the Salmon assay was
a strong determinant in the results presented. For example, if the delta-delta
method is used, but failure of the ±3 CT Salmon assay criterion is ignored
associations between Enterococcus CCE and GI illness are reversed from those
shown in the report, and are statistically signiﬁcant and consistent with those
observed previously (AOR=1.22, p=0.008, data not shown). However this type
of variation across calculation approaches indicates a lack of consistency and
calls into question the conﬁdence in the exposure measure.
The low levels of indicator bacteria at Boquerón Beach were unexpected.
More surprising was the low levels seen at samples collected near the outfalls
and discharge points for the sewage treatment plant and the mangrove swamp
(see 4.18) where it was expected that levels of fecal indicator organisms would
be high. It may have been that discharges from the sewage treatment plant
and various package plants were actually not impacting the beach as suspected,

178



despite their proximity (less than 1-mile). For example, the bay has little wave
and tidal action and as a result there could be little circulation from the dis­
charge points to the beach. Or water could be transported away from the beach
site into the open ocean.
Boquerón Beach had high densities of bathers who often stayed in the wa­
ter for long periods of time. The numbers of bathers in the water were posi­
tively associated with each of the fecal indicator measures (see Tables 4.91, 4.93
4.91). Studies have shown that bathers shed large amounts of indicator bacteria
[67] and bather load has been associated with pathogens in recreational waters
[68, 69]. Bather density was considered in the principal components analysis
of environmental measures which were then subsequently incorporated into the
regression models for health eﬀects (see Section 3.5.4). Although not a prin­
cipal goal of this report, models using bather density as a direct predictor of
illness showed no associations (data not shown). Furthermore the lack of dif­
ferences in illnesses between swimmers and non-swimmers (with the exception
of skin rash, see Table 4.82) do not support a high risk of illness resulting from
other swimmers. However, bather density was rather crudely categorized (see
Table 3.1) and may not have been adequately represented for the purposes of
deriving health risks.
Skin rash was the only symptom signiﬁcantly elevated among swimmers com­
pared to non-swimmers. Although associations between rash and Enterococcus
CFU among swimmers were positive, they were weak. . There was a statistically
insigniﬁcant trend between Enterococcus CFU and respiratory illness (p=0.06).
This association improved (p=0.03) when those with recent swimming exposure
were excluded (Table 4.131). This association was present despite no overall dif­
ferences between swimmers and non-swimmers. Two factors can account for this
apparent contradiction: Few numbers of non-swimmers, and few swimmers ex­
posed to poor quality water. Furthermore, the non-swimming group was quite
diﬀerent from the swimming group, complicating swimmer and non-swimmer
comparisons. This can be seen in Table 4.81 where despite higher crude inci­
dence of respiratory illness among swimmers compared to non-swimmers (7.0%
vs. 5.8%) the adjusted risk ratio is slightly less than 1.
Incidence of GI illness was lower than respiratory illness at Boquerón Beach.
At all previous sites studied, GI illness had the highest incidence. Furthermore,
no positive trends were observed between GI illness and any of the indica­
tors. One potential explanation could be immunity in the local population to
pathogens causing GI illness. Furthermore, it was noted that there were cases of
the H1N1 ﬂu in Puerto Rico at this time. While transmission through water is
unlikely, there may have been an actual increased respiratory symptoms which
may have been exacerbated by the large crowds on the beach. In addition,
concern regarding H1N1 could have resulted in an increased attention to and
reporting of respiratory symptoms.

Future work and next steps

Despite completion of this eﬀort, EPA will continue with further studies and
analyses including:
� Evaluate the possible reasons and potential remedies for the interference
with the PCR assay observed at Boquerón Beach. Replicate ﬁlters have
been preserved from the both beach sites and can be reanalyzed if the
problem can be resolved.
� Evaluate health eﬀects associations with other fecal indicator organisms
measured by qPCR when results are available for both beach sites.
� Evaluate additional ancillary exposures collected such as sand samples,
composite samples and cyanbocateria samples. Compare these with health
eﬀects if warranted.
� Complete testing and analyze results of saliva samples collected at Bo­
querón Beach. 1,209 households were enrolled in the saliva sampling pro­
tocol and over 5,000 samples were collected. Assays are being developed
to detect salivary antibodies to waterborne pathogens.
� Continue to evaluate the nature of the source of fecal contamination at
the two beaches

Conclusions

� Surfside Beach

– Enrollment, follow up and completion of health surveys was successful
with over 11,159 completed interviews.
– Compared with previous marine and freshwater sites [3, 2, 57], a
high proportion of beach-goers had water exposure, immersing their
bodies and heads in the water (73% and 58%, respectively).
– Swimmers had a higher incidence of GI illness, rash and earache
compared to non swimmers.
– The swash impacting Surfside Beach was aﬀected by runoﬀ and had
poor water quality. The swash also had lower salinity than the beach,
suggesting it was aﬀected by runoﬀ.
– Water quality measured by Enterococcus CFU, Enterococcus CCE,
and Bacteroidales CCE was of high quality. Only one day exceeded
current EPA recommended criteria for Enterococcus(35 CFU per 100
ml). This limited the ability to demonstrate associations with health
eﬀects.
–

180



– Body immersion swimmers on the single day when the geometric
mean of Enterococcus CFU exceeded 35 CFU per 100 ml had a higher
incidence of GI illness compared to non-swimmers, but not compared
to swimmers exposed on days when the geometric mean was below
35 CFU per 100 ml.
– Children 10 years of age and under who immersed their body on the
single day when the geometric mean of Enterococcus CFU exceeded
35 CFU per 100 ml had a higher incidence of GI illness compared to
non-swimmers and swimmers exposed on days when the geometric
mean was below 35 CFU per 100 ml.
– Upper respiratory symptoms were associated with Bacteroidales CCE
among swimming children 10 years of age and under. There was some
concern regarding the robustness and stability of this ﬁnding as ad­
justed estimates diﬀered considerably from unadjusted estimates.
� Boquerón Beach

– Enrollment, follow up and completion of the health survey was suc­
cessful with 15,726 completed interviews.
– Despite proximity to a sewage treatment plant discharge (less than
1 mile from the beach), low levels of fecal indicator bacteria were
present at the beach sites.
– Interpretation of water quality measures and health eﬀects associa­
tions using fecal indicator bacteria measured by qPCR was compli­
cated by poor recovery of the salmon DNA added as an exogenous
positive control, indicating potential interference or inhibition.
– Interpretation of qPCR results was further complicated by the high
proportion of results which showed no detection for the fecal indicator
bacteria target sequences.
– As a result, no ﬁrm conclusions can be made regarding the associ­
ations between health eﬀects and water quality indicators measured
by qPCR .
– No single day exceeded the Enterococcus geometric mean criteria of
35 CFU per 100 ml.
–
– There was some evidence of an association between Enterococcus
CFU exposure and increased risk for respiratory illness among those
without recent swimming exposure.

and the Beach Act of 2000, this beach study was initiated in 2003 to assist the Office of Water in
formulating new health and risk guidelines for recreational water.
This study is being conducted jointly by the National Exposure Research Laboratory,
Microbiological and Chemical Exposure Assessment Research Division (NERL/MCEARD), the
National Health and Environmental Research Laboratory (NHERL) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).
This information is being collected as part of a research program consistent with the Sec. 3(a)(v)(1)
of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 and the strategic plan for
EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Office of Water entitled “Action Plan
for Beaches and Recreational Water.” The Beaches Act and ORD’s strategic plan has identified
research on effects of microbial pathogens in recreational waters as a high-priority research area with
particular emphasis on developing new water quality indicator guidelines for recreational waters.
This data collection is for a series of epidemiological studies to evaluate exposure to and effects of
microbial pathogens in marine and fresh recreational waters as part of the EPA’s research program
on exposure and health effects of microbial pathogens in recreational waters. The information
collected by this study program will be used to estimate the relationship between water quality
indicators and health effects. The questionnaire health data will be compared with routinely
collected water quality measurements. The analysis will focus on determining whether any water
quality parameters are associated with increased prevalence of swimming-related health effects.
Study Beach Site
The study period from May 15, 2009 through August 2, 2009 shall take place at Boquerón, Puerto
Rico. The study period from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 shall take place at Surfside
Beach, South Carolina. This work assignment implements field procedures for the data collection
(water quality and human health) at a beach study site and the follow-up telephone interviews.
Westat will travel to this site.
WORK PLAN
Westat is submitting this Work Plan detailing procedures by which support will be provided to
implement a study for the NEEAR (National Epidemiological Environmental Assessment of
Recreational) Water Study. Support will include the collection of epidemiologic data, the collection
and analysis of water and sand sample extracts, and collection of ancillary data.
TASK 1
Computer Assisted Interviews:
Westat will load existing electronic beach and telephone interviews modified under EPA Contract
EP-D-04-064, Work Assignment 2-04 onto CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviews) and
CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviews) devices needed to accomplish a complete sampling
of beach goers at the designated beach area. The appropriate number of devices shall be based on
the number of expected household interviews done on individual days at the designated beach area.
2



Westat will use Blaise® software and appropriate equipment to load the electronic questionnaires
onto tablet handheld computers and telephone interviewing computers. Westat will provide
interviewers to conduct the CAPI and CATI questionnaires by direct data entry utilizing the Blaise®
software program. These questionnaires shall be conducted in both English and Spanish.
Implementation of Computer-Assisted Interviewer Training:
Westat will implement training programs modified in Work Assignment 2-04 for beach and
telephone interviewers. All interviewers shall undergo training using training manuals modified in
Work Assignment 2-04 as part of the training program and undergo Human Subjects Ethics
Training in accordance to the required ethics training required by the UNC biomedical Institutional
Review Board. Westat will provide documentation of training for all interviewers and produce a
report including contractor comments. For Boqueron Beach, the training programs shall be
completed by Friday, May 15, 2009 for beach interviewers and Sunday, May 24, 2009 for telephone
interviewers. For Surfside Beach, the training programs shall be completed by Friday, June 5, 2009
for interviewers and Sunday, June 14, 2009 for telephone interviewers. EPA may be present at any
or all of the interviewing training programs and will have access to CAPI/CATI electronic devices
throughout training sessions.
Paper questionnaires shall be used only in the event that there is a technical failure that prohibits use
of electronic CAPI or CATI devices. This study is to be almost paperless per Office of
Management and Budget’s initiative to use technology and decrease the amount of paper consumed.
TASK 2
Data Collection:
Beach Interviewing:
The beach interview is to be conducted in two parts with the first part, Part A, containing history,
demographic information of household members and contact information for follow-up. Westat
will collect Geographic Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and transect information (See Figure
1) at the family location on the beach, concurrent with collection of Part A of questionnaire data.
Westat will ALSO COLLECT GPS COORDINATES FOR FAMILY LOCATION ON THE
BEACH FOR NONPARTICIPATING FAMILIES. The second part, Part B (exposure date), shall
be conducted at the study station(s) located in or near the beach entrance/exit points designated by
the WACOR or COR. This data shall be included in weekly production reports and a
comprehensive database described under Task 3.
Westat will provide trained beach interviewers (both English and Spanish bilingual) to administer
questionnaires to household units (families or individuals) beginning Friday, May 15, 2009 through
Sunday, August 2, 2009 at the Puerto Rico beach site. Westat will provide trained interviewers for
the Surfside Beach site to administer questionnaires to household units. Spanish Bilingual
interviewers shall be scheduled each data collection day and the number of Spanish Bilingual
interviewers shall be proportionate to the mix of Spanish-speaking households that are expected to
be enrolled in the study. The questionnaires have been reviewed by an Institutional Review Board
(IRB), approved by EPA’s Human Ethics Official and have received Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paper Reduction Act.
Westat will complete beach interviews for twelve (12) designated weekends and three (3) weekday
holiday from Saturday, May 15, 2009 through Sunday, August 2, 2009 at the beach site in Boquerón,
3



Puerto Rico. Data collection weekdays include Memorial Day and two additional Puerto Rican
holidays (July 20 and 27).
In Puerto Rico, Westat will then end beach data collection at designated beach areas Sunday, August
2, 2009 or upon technical direction from the WACOR or COR. Westat will work all designated
non-holiday and holiday weekends and holiday weekdays except in the case of inclement weather
conditions, beach closure or technical direction by the WACOR or COR. The status of inclement
weather conditions will be determined by the WACOR or COR.
In South Carolina, Westat will complete beach interviews for thirteen (13) designated weekends and
two weekday holidays from Saturday, June 6, 2009 through Sunday, September 6. Weekday holidays
are Friday, July 3 and Monday, September 7, 2009.
Westat will set up study stations at appropriate exits at beach areas to be determined by the
WACOR or COR. Westat will provide required furniture and computer equipment to complete this
work assignment. Westat will also provide temporary “on beach” stations for beach interviewers.
These beach stations shall display the USEPA seal and comply with park regulations concerning
location and safety.
For each of the designated data collection days at the beach site, a sampling of households will be
undertaken between 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time. Westat will terminate Part A Interview
collection at 5:00 PM and terminate Part B Interview collection at 6:30 PM. These times will be
flexible depending on beachgoer attendance at various times of day. Westat will set up a system of
counting refusals and those who do not complete the interview processes. Westat will require
interviewers to obtain verbal consent from participants by distributing and discussing the consent
pamphlet.
Telephone Interviewing:
CATI telephone interviewer(s) shall implement trial interviews with at least three (3) members of the
NEEAR Water Study project team designated by the WACOR or COR prior to Monday, June 1,
2009. This exercise allows the US EPA NEEAR Water Study project team to verify that the
telephone interviews are being properly administered to study participants.
Westat will complete telephone surveys during a designated window of 10-12 days following the
beach interviews. Telephone interviewers shall be available beginning on Monday, May 25, 2009
through Saturday, September 19, 2009 for beach data collection days May 15, 2009 through
September 7, 2009. The telephone surveys will collect follow-up information from all households
interviewed at the beach. This data shall be included in weekly production reports and
comprehensive database described under Task 3.
Westat will train telephone interviewers using all data elements to be entered directly into a database
utilizing CATI instruments during the course of the telephone interview. Spanish Bilingual
interviewers shall be scheduled each data collection day and the number of Spanish Bilingual
interviewers shall be proportionate to the mix of Spanish-speaking households that enrolled in the
study and are expected to complete the telephone survey. The questionnaires have been reviewed
by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), approved by EPA’s Human Ethics Official and have
received Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paper Reduction Act.

Field Implementation Plan:
Westat will utilize the 2007 Field Implementation Plan (FIP) describing data collection protocols for
the beach and the telephone interviews and the collection of the environmental data including
sources completed in Work Assignment 2-04 under Contract EP-D-04-064.
Electronic Data Matching and Back-up Files:
Westat will utilize the electronic method for data matching of Part A and Part B Interviews
described in the 2007 FIP (This also included transfer of Part A data collection information for
integration in Part B questionnaires). This electronic data matching is paperless and allows the
USEPA Field Study Monitors to ascertain whether or not households are completing Part B
Interviews that match Part A Interviews. It also allows the interviewers to see previous information
(such as, but not limited to, participant name, household member names, date of interview, and time
of arrival) collected from the participants in the Part A Interview so they will be able to coherently
collect information for Part B Interviews.
As described in the 2007 FIP, Westat will include a back-up plan for this electronic method that
duplicates data as it is collected and each individual participant record shall be stored in two separate
physical locations. These two back-ups shall be designated as collection records only and shall not
be utilized for access. A separate log of data shall be used to complete data linkage of Part A and
Part B records.
Information Distribution:
Westat will provide electronic and written questionnaires, consent forms, and flyers modified in
Work Assignment 2-04. Westat will provide these informational materials to potential participants
in both English and Spanish.
Incentive Distribution:
Westat will provide nonmonetary incentives to households upon completion of Beach Interview
Part A and Part B. Incentives shall be beach related, include the USEPA seal, and be distributed one
(1) per household. The USEPA seal will be provided by the WACOR or COR.
Westat will distribute $25 incentives to each household upon completion of their participation
(completion of both beach interviews and telephone interview). Westat will not distribute more
than one check per household. Westat will distribute letters of participation status to all households
enrolled in either the beach interview or telephone interview. This letter shall indicate completion of
the study or termination of participation status.
Environmental Information:
Westat will collect the following environmental information: air and water temperature, wind
direction, water current direction, UV radiation cloud cover and other information to be identified
by the WACOR or COR. This information shall be collected from existing sources as well as field
instrument collection. Westat will document their sources for this information. Westat will submit
a report evaluating the field collection and environmental data procedures. Existing sources of
environmental information must have approval of the WACOR or COR.
Project Final Report:

5



Westat will provide a final work assignment report that includes overview of field procedures, field
implementation analysis, training and recommendations for improvement, and assessment of
technology.
TASK 3
Data Management:
Westat will implement a data management plan modified in Work Assignment of 2-04 t include, but
not be limited to, the following; 1) processing of beach and telephone interview data in the field
(including back-up), 2) daily count of complete and incomplete interviews, and 3) downloading of
beach data for field review by USEPA WACOR or COR.
Production Reports:
Westat will provide weekly production reports that summarize the daily completion rates to the
USEPA by the close of business on Wednesday after a data collection weekend. For weekends that
include a holiday the production report shall be due on the Friday following data collection
weekend. On holidays not included in the weekend, the production reports are due by the close of
business on Wednesday of the following week. Westat will submit the production reports (beach and
phone) for the weekends for Friday, May 15, 2009 through Saturday, September 19, 2009. These
reports shall be in Excel 2000 format.
Comprehensive Database:
Westat will develop a comprehensive database that includes all data collected from beach interviews,
telephone interviews, environmental data, and water quality data. Westat will submit this database
on a weekly basis outlined in Deliverable 7. This database shall be in SAS software program
language. Westat will submit this database with a beach identifier number for all data. Westat will
submit the database information for the data collection for Friday, May 15, 2009 through Saturday,
September 19, 2009. The comprehensive database is due for each data collection weekend at close
of business 10 calendar days after the final collection day. Westat will provide a draft of the
comprehensive database prior to data collection weekends and obtain approval of the WACOR or
COR. The USEPA will provide an example of a previous database. Westat will submit a report for
this comprehensive database including, but not limited to, detailed explanation of database use,
documentation of changes made over the course of the work assignment, and detailed definitions of
variable names.
Transfer of Ownership of Project-Generated Materials:
Westat will transfer all project-generated products to the USEPA at the end of the work assignment.
Products such as, but not limited to, data, computer-assisted interviews, programs, databases,
reports and materials created under this work assignment belong to the USEPA. These products
shall be transferred electronically, when appropriate. Otherwise, products will be shipped to the
Human Studies Facility in Chapel Hill, NC.
TASK 4
Quality Assurance and Quality Control:
For all tasks except Task 5 (Sand and Water Sampling and Analysis), this project shall utilize a
project Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) modified in Work Assignment 2-04. For Task 5,
this work plan will serve as the Quality Assurance Project Plan. The QAPP shall be approved by
USEPA and implemented as written. In addition, any data forms developed by the contractors must
be approved by USEPA for quality assurance purposes. The QAPP will be considered draft and

6



updated as required during the course of this work assignment. A final QAPP shall be required at
the end of the work assignment.
TASK 5
Sand Sampling and Analysis:
Westat will collect 3 beach sand samples per day on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 3 holiday
weekdays, Monday May 25th, 2009 (1 day), Monday July 20th, 2009 (1 day) and Monday July 27th,
2009 (1 day) from May 15th, 2009 through August 2nd, 2009 (See Table 1), at Boquerón Beach,
Puerto Rico for microbiological analysis by two methods [the current approved membrane filter
(MF) Enterococci method (mEI Agar) and Rapid Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR)].
Westat will collect 3 beach sand samples per day on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 2 holiday
weekdays, (Friday, July 3, 2009 Monday September 7, 2009) from June 6, 2009 through September 7,
2009 (See Table 2), at Surfside Beach, South Carolina for microbiological analysis. Additional
samples may need to be collected if the weather interferes with the attached schedule. The dates for
these samples will be arranged between USEPA and Westat. These samples will be taken in the
designated area of the beach associated with the water quality samples. Westat will employ a
“scoop” method to collect the samples.
Water Quality Sampling and Analysis:
Westat will collect 18 beach water samples per day on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 3 holiday
weekdays, Monday May 25th, 2009 (1 day), Monday July 20th, 2009 (1 day) and Monday July 27th,
2009 (1 day) from May 15th, 2009 through August 2nd, 2009 (See Table 1), at Boquerón Beach,
Puerto Rico for microbiological analysis by two methods [the current approved membrane filter
(MF) Enterococci method (mEI Agar) and Rapid Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR)].
Additional samples may need to be collected if the weather interferes with the attached schedule.
Westat will collect 18 beach water samples per day on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 2 holiday
weekdays, (Friday, July 3, 2009 Monday September 7, 2009) from June 6, 2009 through September 7,
2009 (See Table 2), at Surfside Beach, South Carolina for microbiological analysis. The dates for
these samples will be arranged between USEPA and Westat. Westat will ensure that analysts at
laboratories are proficient in each method and that they consult with USEPA personnel, the
technical advisors for the methods, and/or the manufacturers of the instruments to ensure proper
knowledge and use of the analytical methods. Westat will use the Global Positioning System (GPS)
to identify the location of the beach on land and the individual sample sites in the water. Westat will
transport the samples to the local analytical laboratory for analysis (MF) or processing (QPCR)
within 6 hours of collection. Westat will ship the processed QPCR filters on dry ice to the QPCR
laboratory for analysis. Westat will maintain a Tracking System for all samples and analyses. Westat
will take additional measurements (pH, turbidity, conductivity and salinity) and collect other ancillary
data (air and water temperature, cloud cover, rainfall, wind speed and direction, current direction,
wave height, bather density in the water and on the beach, boats, animals, debris) at each sampling
visit. Westat will take photographs of the beach and the water during the sampling at least once a
day from an elevated vantage point, if possible, to aid researchers in determining the conditions at
the beach.

7



In addition, Westat will collect additional water samples for shipment to the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) for chemical analyses. Westat will provide a copy of the chemical sample airbills/shipping
forms from each shipment to the WACOR or COR.

Sample Analysis: Westat will analyze all water samples collected at the beach by three
microbiological methods during the period of May 15, 2009 through September 7, 2009. Additional
samples, if needed, will also be analyzed by the same methods. Westat will verify 5 colonies/sample
for all samples analyzed by the MF method (Method 1600) on one day (either Saturday or Sunday)
of the first weekend. Westat and laboratories will participate in a dry run to determine and correct
any problems in the procedures at least one week before the study begins. USEPA personnel may
attend. This dry run will consist of a full day’s event of water quality sampling, water quality analysis,
and form documentation on the beach and in the laboratory as it would occur during the actual
study collection.
Data Collection and Handling: Westat will use sample collection/custody forms, approved by
USEPA. Westat will maintain sample collection/custody sheets in a binder in the laboratory where
the analysis is being performed. Westat will record and save all data from each method (counts,
estimated counts, CT values, setup values, complete run files, plots, growth curves, graphs, bit maps,
other computer files, notes, QC data, statistical parameters and analyses, etc.) and submit them to
USEPA in a hard copy and in electronic form. Westat will provide a hard copy of hand-entered
sample collection and custody sheets, data sheets, and all other forms of data for each sampling
event to the WACOR or COR (i.e., within 24 hours) during the 2-day weekend period of sampling
each week at the beach site. Westat will enter the data electronically into database
forms/spreadsheets, and the electronic file(s) will be delivered to the WACOR or COR weekly and
after the analyses have been completed at the beach site, along with all other forms of data. Westat
will send a cover memo with the electronic data outlining the delivery contents by method. Westat
will maintain original copies of the sampling and data worksheets and deliver them to USEPA at the
end of the study. Additions or changes to data worksheets must be approved by USEPA.
Proficiency/Certification
There is no specific training anticipated by USEPA for the current approved membrane filter
Enterococci method (mEI Agar; see Attachments 1 and 2). Westat will ensure that analysts are
proficient in the above method and each of the rapid methods [Rapid Quantitative Polymerase
Chain Reaction (QPCR) and Human Specific QPCR (See Attachment 6).]. The laboratory analysts
who will be performing the assays will be proficient in each method and will consult with USEPA
personnel, the technical advisors, and/or the manufacturers of the instruments to ensure proper
knowledge and use of the analytical methods. Westat and laboratories will be required to process
one or two performance evaluation samples (unknowns) for all methods during the study. General
field and lab safety protocols will also be the responsibility of the laboratory.
Safety Protocol
Westat will utilize a safety plan specific to Task 5 modified in Work Assignment 2-04 contract EPD-04-064.
Documents and Records
Data Deliverables
Westat will initially record membrane filter count data and lot number on field or laboratory
worksheets, then enter and save data electronically in a database (Microsoft Access) or a spreadsheet
11



(Lotus 123 or Excel). Corel Word Perfect or Microsoft Word will be used for the text in reports.
The worksheets, database format, data sheets, or spreadsheets for this method and all other methods
in this study must be approved by the USEPA. If spreadsheets are employed, a separate spreadsheet
file will be employed for each day of sample collection. The file name will incorporate the dates or
range of dates of collection. Separate worksheets within the spreadsheet or different database forms
will be used to record the following information:

–

Field measurement data (See below),

–

Sample collection time/analysis start time/incubation start and end time (See
Microbiological Method Section), and

–

Microbiological data for each sample/volume and associated quality control (QC)
samples.

A hard copy format of hand-entered sample collection and custody sheets, data sheets, and all other
forms of data (graphs, bit maps, CT values, setup values, plots, growth curves, notes, QC data,
statistical parameters and analyses, etc.) for each sampling event will be provided to the COR and
WACOR daily (i.e., within 24 hours) during the 2-day weekend period of sampling each week at the
beach site. Westat will also enter the data electronically into the database forms/spreadsheets, and,
after the analyses have been completed at the beach site, the electronic file(s) will be delivered to the
COR and WACOR along with all other forms of data (graphs, bit maps, plots, curves, setup values,
notes, QC data, statistical parameters and analysis, etc). The delivery will be accompanied by a brief
cover memo outlining the delivery contents by method. The memo will also indicate if there are any
unusual circumstances or known problems surrounding the deliverable, such as QC problems in any
of the methods.
Critical data to be reported are the bacterial counts from the membrane filter tests; the complete run
files for the QPCR method, including CT and setup values, positive and negative controls, etc; the
complete run files. All membrane filter plates will be examined and counted [If possible, plates with
up to 200 colony forming units (CFUs) are to be considered countable, although the ideal number
of CFUs is 20-80.], and the results for all plates will be reported, including zeros and those “toonumerous-to-count” (TNTC). An estimation procedure for TNTC plates will be provided to the
laboratory by USEPA (Attachment 5). The estimation data from the TNTC plates (i.e., the five
counts from five squares on each filter) will be submitted to USEPA along with the count data for
the other samples. QC data will be reported with the sample data for all methods.
In addition to the water samples to be collected, a number of ancillary data will be collected for each
sampling visit. These are shown in Table 3, along with descriptions of their measurement. Field
data will be entered with permanent non-running ink. In addition to the items detailed in Table 3,
any items/activities specific to the beach will be added, for example, at Edgewater Beach in Biloxi
(2005), data on the number of jet skis in and out of the water was recorded.
Any QC results associated with the collection of ancillary data will also be reported (QC samples are
to be specified in Methods/SOPs describing ancillary data collection methods).

Photographic Data
To aid researchers in determining conditions at the beach that may not be readily apparent from the
ancillary data recorded, photographs of the sample locations at the beach area will be taken for the
record at least once a day during the sampling period at the beach site. While the work assignment
requires taking photographs only once a day, Westat proposes to continue taking them at every
sample collection, as in past years, because the conditions on the beach can change substantially over
the course of a day from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm. The photographs at the beach will be taken from an
elevated vantage point, if possible, on one side or the other of the study area. Photographs will be
of sufficient quality to estimate the number of bathers on the beach and in the water. Photos should
be labeled with the beach name, date, target sample collection time, and actual time of photograph.
The camera will be configured to have the date (and time, if possible) displayed on the image. The
beach name, target sample time, and actual time of photograph (if unable to configure camera to
display on image) will be part of the image name. Submission of photographs to the WACOR or
COR will occur at the end of the sampling period for the beach via appropriate means, expected to
be delivery of a CD-ROM with the digital photographs.
General Laboratory Quality Control Records
Laboratories are expected to maintain records of general laboratory quality control activities, such as
are described in this work assignment, the attachments, and some of the references (1,3,5) found at
the end of this work assignment. Such records may become deliverables upon an amendment to the
work assignment.
Data Formats
The exact format of all data fields will be approved by USEPA prior to data collection. Formats will
be based on those specified for this project in the work assignment, in the attachments, or in the
forms recommended by the manufacturers of the instruments. Where possible,
database/spreadsheet templates will have fields preformatted.
Quality Assurance Plan and Revisions
All project personnel will receive copies of the most current version of the Quality Assurance
Project Plan (QAPP) prior to dry run.
Other Records
Various other documents and records (e.g., SOPs, reports, method validation records, laboratory
QC, and maintenance records) are discussed in this document in appropriate sections. The USEPA
reserves the right to request copies of any documents and records from Westats that could affect
this project. Any records that are received, and any records generated by Westat will become part of
the overall project file.
DATA GENERATION AND ACQUISTION
Sample Collection for Microbiological Analyses
16



Water Samples:
Three times a day, at 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM, two water samples will be collected at the
beach along each of the three transects perpendicular to the beach shoreline, one in waist-high water
(1 ml deep) and one in shin-high water (0.3 m deep), for a total of 18 samples per day (i.e., 6 grid
locations x three times per day). See Figure 1a, which depicts the water sampling scheme. The
location of the transects will be at least 20 meters apart or more, if the area used by the swimmers
encompasses more than a total of 60 meters of shoreline. The samples will be collected on
Saturdays and Sundays, and on 3 holiday weekdays, Monday May 25th, 2009 (1 day), Monday July
20th, 2009 (1 day) and Monday July 27th, 2009 (1 day) from May 15th, 2009 through August 2nd, 2009
(See Table 1), at Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico. Westat will collect 18 beach water samples per day
on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 2 holiday weekdays, (Friday, July 3, 2009 Monday September 7,
2009) from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 (See Table 2), at Surfside Beach, South Carolina
for microbiological analysis. It is intended that samples will be collected on the scheduled dates, but
other dates may be substituted if rainfall or other problems prevent swimmers from going to the
beach, prevent water sampling, or create hazardous conditions for the field personnel. Sample
collectors will notify the WACOR or COR of adverse weather conditions or other problems and
request guidance whether to begin or continue sampling on a given day or weekend. This is
necessary because the samples must be collected when there are sufficient bathers at the beach to
allow NHEERL to conduct their concurrent epidemiological/health study.
Global Positioning System (GPS) readings of the actual water collection locations and a photo of the
sample collection sites will be taken.
Figure 1a. Water Sampling Locations

17



Remote Chemical Analysis Samples
In addition, 3 1-liter plastic-coated glass bottles will be taken once a day, during the 11:00 AM
collection at each of the three transect locations in waist-high water and at the center transect only in
shin-high water (sampling points 2, 3, 4, and 6, as circled in Figure 1b) each Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, and on 3 holiday weekdays (May 25th, July 20th, and July 27th) during the study for remote
chemical analysis, described in a later section (for a total of 12 samples/sampling day). Figure 1b is a
schematic that shows the collection of water samples at 11:00 am.

Figure 1b. USGS Water Sampling Locations at 11:00 am.

Sand Samples:
Westat will collect three sand samples per day at 8:00 AM along with the 8:00 AM water samples.
The sand samples will be collected 1 meter from the lowest water level (when the waves have
receded from the shoreline) at the same 3 transects where water samples are collected. See Figure

18



1c, which is a schematic that shows the collection of the sand samples at 8:00 am (sampling points 7,
8 and 9). The sand should be wet. If the sand is not wet at 1 meter from the water, the sand
collection location will be moved the shortest possible distance toward the water to a location where
the sand is wet. Westat will record the actual distance from the water. Global Positioning System
(GPS) readings of the actual sand collection locations and a photo of the sample collection sites will
be taken.
The sand samples will be collected on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 3 holiday weekdays, Monday
May 25th, 2009 (1 day), Monday July 20th, 2009 (1 day) and Monday July 27th, 2009 (1 day) from May
15th, 2009 through August 2nd, 2009 at Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico (see Table 1). Westat will
collect the sand samples Saturdays and Sundays, and on 2 holiday weekdays, (Friday, July 3, 2009
Monday September 7, 2009) from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 (See Table 2), at Surfside
Beach, South Carolina for microbiological analysis. As with the water samples, it is intended that
samples will be collected on the scheduled dates, but other dates may be substituted if rainfall or
other problems prevent swimmers from going to the beach, prevent water sampling, or create
hazardous conditions for the field personnel. Sample collectors will notify the WACOR or COR of
adverse weather conditions or other problems and request guidance whether to begin or continue
sampling on a given day or weekend. This is necessary because the samples must be collected when
there are sufficient bathers at the beach to allow NHEERL to conduct their concurrent
epidemiological/health study.

Composite Samples:
Westat will collect one additional bottle at each of the 6 grid locations (see Figure 1a) three times a
day at 8AM, 11 AM and 3PM to be used for creation of composite samples. A total of 18 bottles
will be collected per day. In Puerto Rico, these samples will be collected on Saturdays and Sundays,
as well as 3 weekday holidays (Monday May 25th, 2009, Monday July 20, 2009, and Monday July 27,
2009) during the study period of May 15, 2009 to August 2, 2009. In South Carolina, these samples
will be collected on Saturdays and Sundays, and on 2 holiday weekdays, (Friday, July 3, 2009 Monday
September 7, 2009) during the study period from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009. At the
lab these samples will be combined to create a composite sample, as described in the “Analytical
Methods” section.

Sampling Methods
Water Samples:
See Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20th edition (1998), Section
9060, for recommendations on microbiological sampling (3). Briefly, samples will be collected in
waist-high (1 m deep) and shin-high (0.3 m deep) water by serially immersing two (2) capped 1000mL pre-sterilized, polypropylene bottles (or four 500-mL bottles) to the appropriate sample depth,
removing the lids and allowing them to fill, re-capping lids (to prevent contamination from surface

20



water), raising them out of the water, removing the lids, and emptying them slightly to allow
approximately 1 inch of head space before securing the lids. Sampling devices may be employed.
Samples will be taken about 1 foot (0.3 m) under the surface of the water in waist-high water, and
shin-high samples will be taken 6 inches (0.15 m) above the bottom of the water. The samples
collected near the bottom must be taken with care so as not to introduce additional
sand/solids/debris into the samples. Sample plans may have to be altered in extreme or unusual
circumstances. If alterations of the sample method are considered, the WACOR or COR will be
notified and guidance will be requested. Westat will utilize field protocols from Work Assignment
2-04 under contract EP-D-04-064. Such field protocols and sampling procedures will be submitted
to the WACOR or COR for approval prior to the beginning of the study.
Three 1-liter water samples will be collected aseptically, as described above, at each location on the
beach grid (Figure 1a) for microbial analysis:
1.

1 liter will be used for the membrane filter method and the ancillary measurements
(which will be done last to prevent contamination).

2.

1 liter will be used for the rapid QPCR method.

3.

1 liter will be used for the Composite Samples

Two 1-liter plastic coated glass bottles will be used for the USGS remote chemical analysis, at the
11:00 AM sampling period, at sampling points 2, 3, 4 and 6 only.
Following collection, all samples will be placed in coolers and maintained on ice during transport
and at
1 - 4° C during the time interval before they are analyzed or shipped (samples for chemical analyses
only). No additional samples are collected for the determination of pH and turbidity. These
measurements are made from the same samples used for membrane filtration after these analyses are
completed to prevent contamination.
Any problems encountered while sampling or while taking ancillary measurements will be recorded
on data collection sheets in comment fields or on additional sheets clearly identifying the date, time,
sample location (on grid) and reported to the WACOR or COR if problems may affect the analytical
results. In the event of problems, corrective actions taken (where possible) will be documented by
the field team leader, along with the results of such actions.
Sand Samples
Westat will collect, transport, and process the sand samples according to the protocol provided by
Kristen Brenner on April 2, 2007. The following text is taken from that protocol. Sand samples will
be collected with sterile, 2 inch x 10 inch stainless steel liners (AMS, American Falls, Idaho, or the
equivalent). The liner will be pushed into the sand at least 8 inches. The liners will be sterilized at
the lab by rinsing them with water, wrapping them in aluminum foil and heating them in the drying
oven at 170 °C overnight. The liners will remain wrapped in the aluminum foil until use. Liners
containing the sand samples will be capped at both ends, placed in zip-lock plastic bags labeled using

21



a simplified version of the usual alpha-numeric system (See below.), and transported to the
laboratory on ice. Samples will be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C. until analyzed.
In the laboratory, sand samples will be aseptically transferred to sterile wide-mouth polypropylene
bottles (500 ml or 1- liter, depending on the quantity of the sand), also labeled using the simplified
version of the usual alpha-numeric labeling system. For each sand sample, 75 grams of sand will be
aseptically weighed out in a sterile, pre-tared, wide-mouth 500-ml bottle (using sterile spatulas), and
300 ml of Standard Methods phosphate-buffered rinse/dilution water (3), measured with a sterile
graduated cylinder, will be added to each bottle. Each bottle will be vigorously shaken 50 times
(Please count.). Immediately after shaking, some of the contents of the bottle will be poured into
two sterile 50-ml, disposable centrifuge tubes (Corning 430829 or the equivalent) and filled to the
50-ml mark. The tubes will be centrifuged for 5 minutes at ~3000 rpm (600 x g) to bring down the
sand and sediment, and the supernatant will be removed using a sterile pipette and placed in a sterile
100-ml polypropylene bottle for subsequent analysis by Method 1600 (Attachment 1) and the
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) method (Attachment 6).
The accuracy of the 50-ml mark on the disposable tubes will be checked before the dry run by
randomly choosing 5 tubes from the package, weighing each of the 5 tubes, and recording the
weights. After 50 ml of distilled water is measured with a graduated cylinder and poured into each of
the tubes, the tubes are again weighed. The weight of the distilled water (The difference between
the two weights) in each tube should be close to 50 grams. Observe the position of the water
meniscus with reference to the 50-ml mark on the tubes. In addition, 5 randomly chosen,
preweighed tubes should be filled with distilled water so that the meniscus touches the top of the
50-ml line. Weigh the tubes again and determine the weight of the water by difference. If the mark
is accurate, the weight of the distilled water should be close to 50 grams. Record all results, and
send a copy of the results to the WACOR and Kristen Brenner, the technical point-of-contract for
sand analyses.
During the dry run, aliquots of 10 ml and 1 ml of each undiluted sand extract and 1 ml of the 10-1 –
10-6 dilutions of each extract in phosphate-buffered dilution water (3) will be analyzed by EPA
Method 1600 for Enterococci (Attachment 1). The number of filtrations for the actual study will be
reduced after the normal range of concentrations in sand are determined during the dry run. Three
20-ml aliquots of each sample will be filtered, and the filters will be frozen, as described in the
QPCR Method (Attachment 6), during the dry run. The sand extraction method described above
and the volumes used for both tests may have to be adjusted, depending on the normal range of
concentrations of Enterococci in the extracts during the dry run. Westat will obtain EPA’s approval
before changing the protocol or volumes analyzed.
In addition, the pH of each extract will be taken and recorded, and a 25-gram portion of each sand
sample will be dried at 100 degrees C for several days to a week in a preweighed container. After
the samples are dry, the containers should be weighed again to determine the dry weight of the sand
samples by difference. Leftover sand samples, the bottles of the sand-buffer slurry, and extracts
should be stored in the refrigerator until all the results have been obtained with all tests (about a
week).
Sample Handling and Custody

22



Westat will utilize sample collection/custody forms modified in Work Assignment 2-04 under
contract EP-D-04-064 as part of the general forms. A sample form is shown in Attachment 3. The
distribution of each individual bottle taken at each location on the beach grid (Figure 1) must be
documented on the custody forms. A copy of each airbill for the shipment of the samples for
remote chemical analysis and a copy of the ASR custody form (Attachment 4) enclosed with each
shipment of samples must be attached to the appropriate custody forms and submitted to USEPA.
Each USGS sample must be cross-referenced with the NEEAR study locations.
Prior to sampling visits, tracking forms will be printed by a member of the site project team. The
location, date, target collection time, field team leader, and information about all samples to be
collected during that visit will be entered on the forms, by hand (or electronically, prior to printing).
The forms will be printed on paper suitable for field work. Each cooler used to transport samples
from the site to the lab will have a copy of the appropriately completed collection/custody form(s)
in it or securely attached to it. Ideally, Westat will know in advance how many samples can fit in a
given cooler and could, therefore, prepare specific tracking sheets for each cooler prior to going to
the field. If more than one cooler is needed, the coolers will be numbered, and cooler numbers will
be cross-referenced on the appropriate tracking sheet. Individual bottles for the rapid methods can
be distributed after the samples are logged in at the laboratory, and the custody forms must be
signed by each of the method analysts when portions/aliquots of the samples are removed.
Additional columns on the tracking forms include the actual collection time, the time samples arrive
at the laboratory, and their storage location. Arrival time at the laboratory can be indicated by
entering a time for the first sample on a custody sheet, and drawing a down arrow in the lab arrival
time column for the rest of the samples. The field storage location may also be filled in this manner.
A different form (or forms) will be used to record the dates and times when analysis by QPCR and
filtering begins (MF and QPCR), the dates and time plates are placed in the water bath (or filters are
placed in the freezer for the QPCR method), the dates and time samples are removed from
incubation (or freezer for the PCR method), and the analysis results. There will be spaces for
associated initials for each of the sequential steps. The various “analysis” times will be treated on a
batch basis; i.e., a sample batch is all of the samples brought to the laboratory at the same time for
analysis, such as all 6 morning samples.
Microbiological sample containers will be labeled with water resistant sample labels. The sample
bottles will have IDs with consecutive numbers to facilitate handling in the laboratory and to
prevent errors. However, Westat will be responsible for placing the requisite additional information
onto sample bottles at the time of sampling to ensure that the samples can be clearly identified. It is
recommended that the information (or at least alphanumeric information, such as suggested directly
below) be added just prior to or just after sampling, as this should minimize the chance of getting
samples in the wrong bottles. Information to be added would include the date, scheduled and actual
time of collection, and some type of alphanumeric that identifies the sampling location, and the
method(s) to be used.
Westat proposes to use the following sample labeling scheme for all water and sand samples. This
scheme is the same as has been used in past years for water sampling and it was easily modified to
accommodate the sand samples introduced this year. Microbiological sample containers will be
labeled with water resistant sample labels using the following alphanumeric (9-character) scheme (to
avoid confusion and duplicate sample numbers):

Westat understands that sample containers may be reused after proper cleaning and resterilization or
bottles, presterilized by the manufacturer, may be used. Westat will use only presterilized bottles.
24



Westat will obtain a copy of the manufacturer’s sterilization certificate and/or record for each lot
should be obtained. In addition, the sterility of a few randomly-chosen bottles from each lot should
be tested before field use by adding sterile Trypticase Soy Broth to the bottles, incubating for 48-72
hours at 35° C, and observing the bottles for bacterial growth. Prior to leaving for the field, the
sample team leader will check to see that there are an appropriate number of sample bottles and
sample ID labels for the sampling visit (Bottles may have labels attached prior to sampling, if it is
demonstrated that this has no deleterious effects on the labels.) for the sampling visit. There should
also be extra, unlabeled sample containers, and a means to label them for back-up purposes. Copies
of completed sample collection/custody sheets will be provided to the WACOR or COR daily along
with their associated data sheets.
As stated above, following collection, samples are to be maintained on ice during transport and at 1 4° C until the time of analysis. This is the only preservation step. Microbiological analysis of water
samples will commence within six hours of collection; it is critical that sample plates from the
membrane filter methods be placed in the water bath within eight hours of sampling. In the event
of any problems or irregular occurrences, it is imperative that the WACOR or COR be called
immediately for guidance, and that the comments fields on the various data sheets be used to record
problems/corrective actions, so that the effect on data quality can be considered. Examples of
problems that might occur include sampling difficulties, failure to ice-down samples, missed
holding/analysis times, longer than acceptable incubation times, problems with the instruments, etc.
With the rapid QPCR method, the critical step is the filtration of the water samples and storage of
the filters in the freezer within the 8 hours after collection. Once the filters are frozen, analysis can
be done as time allows. The times the QPCR method filters are frozen and stored, the location of
the freezer(s), and the dates and times of the analyses will be recorded. If QPCR filters are analyzed
in another lab, they must be shipped by overnight express on dry ice. The other laboratory will
conform to the QC requirements of this document. Problems with the rapid methods, like those
with the filter methods, must be reported and guidance requested from the WACOR or COR.
Samples may be disposed of following successful microbiological processing by each of the
microbial methods, including the counting of all plates, successful pH and turbidity measurements,
and completed analysis of samples by all methods except for the QPCR method. However, QPCR
samples must be filtered and the filters frozen before the disposal of the samples. Contact the
WACOR or COR about the disposition of the samples if unusual results are obtained.
Westat will maintain a dedicated sample record book that is used to record all sample IDs as samples
are checked into the laboratory. The record book will also have columns for date checked in,
storage locations, and disposal dates. Westat has the responsibility for ensuring that all sample IDs
are recorded and will initial the record book for each batch of samples received to indicate that all
expected samples were present. The USEPA may request that the record book or copies of pages
from this record book be made available for examination. Westat is also responsible for verifying
that the arrival time at the laboratory is entered in the appropriate column on the sample collection
sheets, and will initial sample collection sheets in the appropriate space(s) to indicate such, and will
note any leaking containers or other irregularities.

Standard Membrane Filter Method Enterococci (Method 1600)

Attachment 1, “Method 1600: Membrane Filter Test Method for Enterococci in Water,”
EPA/821/R-97/004, May 1997 (4) describes the assay for Enterrococci. This method can also be
found in Attachment 2. “Improved Enumeration Methods for Recreational Water Quality
Indicators: Enterococci and Escherichia coli,” EPA/821/R-97/004 (7). These attachments are detailed
enough, including descriptions of required equipment, so that the membrane filter method can be
performed. As such, these two attachments represent the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for
the critical membrane filter data to be obtained from the field study. A 1-liter sample or two 500-ml
water samples will be collected for use in performing the filtration method and the ancillary pH and
turbidity measurements, which will be performed last to avoid contamination. All collected samples
will be analyzed for Enterococci by the MF method using sample volumes of 100, 10 and 1 mL [except
for special circumstances; for example, if plates at the standard sample volumes are all TNTC, or
produce zero CFUs, then sample volumes may need to be adjusted.] The laboratory may have to
adjust volumes using their own judgment if immediate communication with the WACOR or COR is
not possible. In the event that the laboratory must adjust the volumes and adjust, the adjustment
and documentation of reason must be indicated in the records submitted to the USEPA. Analysis
of each sample will be initiated within 6 hours of its collection, and processing (filtration and plating)
will be completed no later than 8 hours after collection.
Specific QC requirements to be incorporated into the assays (in place of the general guidance in the
methods) can be found in the next section of this plan. Table 3 summarizes some of the key features
of the method. Any modifications to the method, such as using auto-pipets or micro pipets instead
of standard glass pipets, must be approved by the WACOR or COR prior to being implemented.
Any other questions regarding the methods should also be addressed to the WACOR or COR prior
to the start of field activity.

On the sample collection/tracking sheets and final data sheets, laboratory analysts are responsible
for entering times and their initials for the following sequential steps:

–

Analysis start time.

–

Time at which plates being incubation in the water bath.

–

Time at which plates are removed from the water bath for counting.

26



These times will be entered by hand initially, and later entered into the database electronically. The
times listed above, and initials, may be entered in a batch-wise manner. The laboratory is also
responsible for entering dilution data, count data, QC data, etc. on data sheets. Responsibility for
electronic data entry will be determined by Westat.
Samples are to be analyzed in batches. A batch will be considered to be all of the samples that were
delivered to the laboratory at the same time. The plates for each batch of samples should start their
incubation periods at the same time, and the microbiological control samples described below under
“specific filtration control tests” will accompany each analysis batch.
For the membrane filter assay, the most critical quality control requirements are as follows:

–

Prior to any sampling/filtering, an appropriate volume of TSA [Tryptic Soy
Agar/Trypticase Soy Agar (Difco 0369-17-6, BD 4311043, Oxoid CM 0129B, or
the equivalent)] will be prepared, and tested as described below. These plates will
later by used for QC samples during sample runs. The recipe for TSA and the
contamination screening for TSA plates is described below:
Composition:
Tryptone
Soytone
NaCl
Agar

15 g
5g
5g
15 g

Preparation: Add the dry ingredients listed above the 1000 mL of reagent-grade
distilled water, and heat to boiling to dissolve the agar completely. Autoclave at
121° C (15 lbs pressure) for 15 min. Dispense the agar into 9 x 50 mm petri
dishes (5 mL/plate).
Test for contamination: Incubate all plates for 24 - 48 hr at 35° C to check for
contamination. Discard any plates with growth. If ≥ 5% of the plates show
contamination, discard all plates, and make new medium. Store plates in plastic
bags at 4°C until needed. The final pH should be 7.3 ± 0.2. Records of
preparation and testing will be maintained, and will be submitted to the WAM
upon request.

–

Each batch of mEI agar is to be pre-tested for performance (i.e., correct enzyme
reaction) with known cultures of target (e.g., Enterococcus faecium or Enterocococcus
fecalis) and non-target (e.g., Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas species) organisms.
Records of such tests are to be maintained by the laboratory and will be
submitted to the COR and WACOR upon request.

–

Specific filtration control tests, listed below, are to be performed each time a
batch of samples are analyzed, and the results recorded. Results for all filter, agar
or buffer controls, including counts (if any), will be reported with the sample
results.

27



–

Filter Control: Place one or more membrane filters on sterile TSA plates, and
incubate the plates for 24 hours at 35° C. Absence of growth indicates sterility of
the filter(s).

–

Phosphate-Buffered Dilution Water Controls: Filter a 50-mL volume of sterile
dilution water before beginning the sample filtrations and a 50-mL volume of
dilution water after completing the sample filtrations. Place the filters on TSA
plates, and incubate the plates for 24 hours at 35° C. Absence of growth indicates
sterility of the dilution water.

–

Agar Control: Place one or more plates of each medium, mEI and TSA, in the
incubator. Incubate mEI at 41° C and TSA at 35° C for 24 hours to check for
contamination. Absence of growth indicates sterility of the plates.

–

Optional membrane test: Test new lots of membrane filters against an acceptable
reference lot using the method of Brenner and Rankin (4). Although optional, this
test is recommended. In lieu of performing this test, the laboratory should
purchase filters from a reputable source. The USEPA has found (by the method
referenced) that Sartorious filters have generally provided satisfactory
performance; however, this does not mean other filters are unacceptable.

There are no specific sample IDs for the specific filtration control samples. On the hard copy
format batch analysis sheets, their results will be reported with the following codes:
YYZ (MEDIA), where,
YY = AC, PB, or MF (for Agar Control, Phosphate Buffer dilution water controls,
or
Membrane Filter control).
Z=
for

B or A, or nothing (used only for phosphate buffer dilution water controls; B
“Before filtering” control, A for “After filtering” control).

(MEDIA) = mEI or TSA, the medium used for the control.
The methods contain other specific QC elements, such as requirements for laboratory water quality,
specifying that thermometers be NIST-traceable, calling for daily confirmation of incubator and
water bath temperatures. Such method specifications will be adhered to, and the adherence
documented. All autoclave runs will contain maximum-registering thermometers to ensure
appropriate temperatures are achieved. Additionally, at least weekly, autoclave runs will contain
spore strips or vials, which will be incubated according to the manufacturer’s instructions to check
for proper sterilizer operation. Calibration records should be maintained for laboratory balances, pH
meters, etc.
The method SOP (Attachments 1 and 2) contains procedures for verifying the correct identities of
organisms. Verification tests are required for all samples (5 colonies/sample) from one day (either
Saturday or Sunday) of the first weekend (6 sample locations x 3 times per day x 1 day = 18 samples

28



total) at the beach site. Results of the verification tests will be recorded and reported to the WACOR
or COR with the other sample data in a mutually agreed upon manner.
It is expected that laboratories will follow generally accepted good microbiology laboratory practice,
such as described in the USEPA Microbiology Methods Manual, Part IV, C (1); Section 9000 of the
20th edition of Standard Methods (3); or the QC section of the USEPA’s “Manual for the
Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Drinking Water” (5). Copies of any records associated with
standard laboratory QC practices will be made available to the USEPA upon request.
2.

Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) Method

Attachment 6 describes the procedures for the detection of Enterococci and Bacteroides in water
samples based on the collection of these organisms on membrane filters, extraction of their total
DNA, and polymerase change reaction (PCR) amplification (i.e., a process whereby the quantity of
DNA is doubled in each cycle of amplification) of a genus-specific DNA sequence using the
TaqMan™ PCR product detection system. The TaqMan™ system signals the formation of PCR
products by a process involving the breakdown of a double-labeled fluorogenic probe that
specifically attaches to the target sequence at a site between the two PCR primer recognition
sequences. The reactions are performed in a specially-designed thermal cycling instrument that
automates the detection and quantitative measurement of the fluorescent signals produced by probe
degradation during each cycle of amplification. These signals are directly related numerically to the
quantities of PCR products produced.
Westat understands that the attachment is detailed enough, including descriptions of required
equipment, so that the method can be performed. As such, this attachment represents the standard
operating procedure (SOP) for the critical data to be obtained from this portion of the field study. A
1-liter sample or two 500-ml water samples will be collected for use in this method. All collected
samples will be analyzed for Enterococci and Bacteroides using sample volumes of 100 mL [except for
special circumstances; for example, if this volume is found to be impractical to filter, then sample
volumes may need to be adjusted]. Filtration of each sample will be initiated within 6 hours of its
collections. Five (5) replicate filtrations will be performed, and the filters will be transferred to
extraction tubes, as described in the protocol (Attachment 6), and stored at -20° C for an indefinite
period. All filters will be properly labeled to identify the water sample they came from.
The local analytical lab will perform the 5 replicate filtrations and ship 3 filters to the PCR lab and 2
filters to Dr. Richard Haugland of USEPA (26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Location 314,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45268-1314; Telephone: 513 / 569-7135), all by overnight express on dry ice on
the Monday following the weekend the samples were collected.
The PCR lab will perform the extraction to obtain DNA to be used for QPCR analyses for all
microorganisms (Enterococci and Bacteroides) as soon as possible using only one of the filters
(Attachment 6), and two filters will be stored in the freezer as backups or for other/later analyses.
At the end of this study, all remaining frozen filters will be sent on dry ice by overnight express to
Dr. Richard Haugland of the USEPA.

29



Specific quality control (QC) requirements to be incorporated into these analyses are listed below, as
well as those in the method protocol.

–

QC requirements for sample collection and filtration are specified in the
Microbiological Methods section.

–

Cell suspensions of the calibrator strains, Enterococcus faecalis, American Type
Cutlure Collection (ATCC) 29212, Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, and reference
strain, Geotrichum candidum, University of Alberta Microfungus Collection and
Herbarium (UAMH) 7836, will be provided to the laboratory by the USEPA. The
cell suspensions provided must be stored by the laboratory at -70° C, until used.
Preliminary QPCR analyses must be performed using four tubes of these
suspensions prior to the start of the study, and the results (CT values and run files)
must be reported to USEPA. Subsequent average results for these samples on
each day of analysis should be within +2 CT units of the average of the initial
values (See paragraph below on monitoring the performance of the thermal
cycling instrument and PCR reagents).

–

Training for the laboratory on the highly specialized scientific PCR equipment
will be provided by the government for validity of data. Westat will be responsible
for ensuring that the PCR technician has documented experience in QPCR
technology.

–

Westat will be required to purchase PCR reagents, including primers and
fluorescently-labeled probes. Primer and probe sequences will be provided by the
USEPA.

–

Westat will be required to monitor the performance of the thermal cycling
instrument and PCR reagents based on ongoing calibrator sample analysis results.
(See above.) In the event of failure to meet these performance criteria, Westat will
be required to prepare and analyze a new set of calibrator extracts, identify the
source of the problem (e.g., reagents or instruments), and take corrective action.

–

Westat will be required to provide adequate facilities and carry out precautions
necessary to minimize the likelihood of DNA contamination. Manipulation of
samples and reagents will be performed in laminar flow hoods or workstations
with UV light sources, and the areas will be disinfected before and after each use
with 10% bleach. Disposable aerosol barrier pipette tips will be used for all liquid
transfers. Tubes and other disposables that are not sterilized by the manufacturer
must be autoclaved before use. All supplies and disposables will be DNA-free.
Distilled water and other reagents must be verified to be free of target DNA in
negative control analyses performed with each set of sample analyses.

–

All pipettors used will be calibrated prior to commencing work and on a
semiannual basis afterwards. It is recommended that the pipette calibration be
verified weekly by weighing several different amounts of water (in the ranges use)
pipetted into a properly tared container.

30



–

This work assignment will also include four other combinations of reagents that
will be tested for each organism by PCR method.

3. Composite Samples
Westat will create a composite sample by adding equal volumes from each of the three transects for
the different depths. Westat will create a shin-depth composite sample by adding equal volumes
from each of the shin-depth samples. Westat will create waist-depth composite sample by adding
equal volumes from each of the waist-depth samples. Westat will create a total composite sample by
adding equal volumes from all depth samples. There will be a total of 9 composite samples per day:
3 shin-depths (8AM, 11AM, and 3PM); 3 waist-depths (8AM, 11AM, and 3PM); and 3 all-depths
(8AM, 11AM, and 3PM). These samples are created from parent samples (the additional 1-liter
bottle collected at each grid location). These samples will be used to run QPCR (for Enterococci and
Bacteroides) and Method 1600 Membrane Filtration analysis.

Ancillary Measurements
Ancillary measurements listed in Table 2 will be collected by a variety of means. Some are collected
by simple observation; others involve the use of equipment, such as pH meters, wind gauges, and
rain gauges. It is noted here that WACOR or COR approval of any deviation in methods is required.
For any ancillary data collection, especially that involving specific equipment, Westat will be
responsible for documenting the exact methods used to collect the data, and to provide information
about the calibration and QC procedures for any equipment. This documentation will be provided
for approval to the USEPA WACOR or COR prior to the occurrence of any field sampling.
Appropriate field team members or lab team members are responsible for entering data on
appropriate data collection sheets. Westat may propose additional QC activities related to sampling
and analysis in their QAPP and work plan as necessary and appropriate. Any changes from the QC
specified by individual method technical point-of-contacts must be confirmed with them before
implementation.
Sample Collection and Custody for Remote Chemical Analysis
Three additional 1-liter water samples will be collected once a day, during the 11:00 AM collection
period, in plastic-coated, ashed amber glass bottles, furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, at each of the three transect locations in waist-high water and at the central location in shinhigh water (sampling points 2, 3, 4 and 6 in Figure 1b) for a total of 12 1-liter samples (3 bottles at
each of 4 locations). Samples will be collected at the marine water beach by the same methods used
for collecting the water samples for microbial analysis. The bottles should be permanently labeled
with the location of sample site, the date and time of collection, and designated “For Chemical
Analysis (Unfiltered Water).” After cooling the samples on ice, the bottles will be packed in coolers
with ice along with Analytical Services Requests (ASR) (Attachment 4) contained in double zip-lock
bags, and shipped by overnight carrier to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [Dr. Edward T.

31



Furlong, USFS, Denver Federal Center – Building 95, Denver, Colorado 80225-0046; Telephone
(303) 236-3941; Fax: (303) 236-3499; E-Mail efurlong@usfs.gov] for chemical analyses and
comparison of interlaboratory variation.
At the time of collection, an Analytical Services Request form (ASR), Attachment 4, will be
completed in its entirety. The ASR should be placed in a waterproof covering and shipped with the
sample to the appropriate laboratory. All sample bottles collected during a single weekend may be
sent to the USGS in one shipment (by overnight express) on the Monday following the weekend,
provided all samples are refrigerated during the entire time from collection until shipment. Coolers
and packing material to ship samples will be provided by the USEPA (Dr. Susan Glassmeyer, 26 W.
Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Location 564, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268-1564; telephone: 513 / 5697757), and USEPA will provide airbills with the shipping costs billed to USEPA for the field
personnel to use.
Quality Control (QC)
The most critical elements of quality control for the membrane filter method are those related to the
microbiological assays. Sampling is straightforward; Westat must ensure that the proper samples are
taken in the appropriately labeled containers. Holding time of samples will be considered critical.
Samples that have not been placed in the water bath in the membrane filter method or completely
filtered and placed in the freezer for use in the QPCR method within eight hours of collection will
be considered to have produces invalid data. (However, all data will be collected, compiled, and
reported to USEPA). The intent of this project is to collect all of the data for subsequent evaluation
by the USEPA project team, who will ultimately determine its utility based on their collective
expertise and experience. No data will be rejected outright by the persons performing the analysis.
All data, including Too-Numerous-To-Count’s (TNTC) and zero’s in the membrane filter methods,
will be reported to the USEPA. An estimation procedure for TNTC plates will be provided to the
laboratory by USEPA (Attachment 5). The estimation data from the TNTC plates (i.e., the five
counts from five squares on each filter) will all be submitted to USEPA along with the count data
for the other samples. Westat will calibrate and maintain the instruments according to the methods
and/or the manufacturer’s recommendations. Westat will follow accepted good microbiology
laboratory practice and maintain QC records. Westat will participate in any QA audits conducted,
and will run one or more performance evaluation samples provided by the USEPA. Westat will
contact the WACOR or COR when problems occur and document corrective actions taken in a
report.
Corrective Actions
Failure to meet any QC requirements, including those associated with standard good laboratory
practice, requires that appropriate corrective actions be taken. All QC failures, associated corrective
actions, and their effectiveness, must be documented on a corrective action form, and submitted to
the USEPA WACOR or COR as part of the weekly reports. Data associated with quality control
problems will be clearly identified in such reports, along with an assessment as to the QC failure’s
potential effect(s) on data quality. The WACOR or COR will be notified of such
problems/corrective actions as soon as possible to the time of the actual occurrence. All related
sample and ancillary data will still be reported in the standard way, with the QC problems clearly
noted on copies of the data deliverables.

32



Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, and Maintenance
Any SOP for equipment/instrument which Westat may be required to develop or provide will
describe standard maintenance procedures for equipment. Maintenance records will be described in
the SOPs, and will be made available to USEPA upon request, including monitoring records of basic
equipment such as incubators, refrigerators, etc.
For any equipment that might affect critical data (i.e., microbiological or ancillary data), Westat will
prepare a short report for the WACOR or COR describing how the equipment was inspected and
tested upon receipt. The report will be delivered within two weeks of equipment being placed in
service.
Instrument/Equipment Calibration and Frequency
Any SOPs for instruments and equipment which Westat may be required to develop or provide will
fully describe calibration and calibration verification procedures. This should include reference to
any calibrations conducted using certified equipment and/or standards with known valid
relationships to nationally recognized performance standards. Field instruments/gauges and
laboratory measuring equipment, such as balances and volumetric measuring devices (e.g.,
micropipettes), will be professionally serviced/certified within the six months prior to the
commencement of the field/laboratory activities for this project.
Tracking and Inspection/Acceptance of Supplies and Consumables
Westat will have a system for tracking supplies, reagents, etc. prior to the start of the field season.
The membrane filter methods (Attachments 1 and 2) describe the minimum requirements for the
quality of chemicals and laboratory water. Quality control procedures for laboratory water outlined
in the USEPA drinking water certification manual (5) are recommended. Westat will at least
maintain basic records (i.e., resistively readings, filter changes, etc.) for their laboratory water
systems.
The optional (but recommended) filter test (2); previously described, may be employed to test new
membrane filter lots. All media prepared will be routinely tested for sterility. The goal is to have a
clear association of all microbiological data with specific lots of all materials employed in performing
analyses. All records associated with materials tracking and preparation will be made available to
USEPA upon request.
Data Management
Some elements of data management for field data and laboratory data were previously outlined.
Westat will initially hand-enter results on pre-printed forms that are approved by USEPA.
On an approximately daily basis, completed hand-entered data sheets will be sent to the WACOR or
COR. Weekly submissions will also be submitted to the WACOR or COR.
Westat will maintain original copies of sampling and data worksheets until instructed by the
WACOR or COR on the deposition of the worksheets. Westat will maintain two copies, on separate
33



storage media, of electronic versions of data until instructed by the WACOR or COR on the
disposition of the data.
Readiness Review/Dry Runs
At least one week prior to actual sampling, sampling/analysis personnel will perform a readiness
review/dry run at the beach site. One or more USEPA representatives may attend. A checklist
modified in Work Assignment 2-04 under contract EP-D-04-064 will be utilized by Westat that
details all equipment, supplies, worksheets, logbooks, etc. required to conduct sampling, ancillary
data collection, microbiological analysis and data recording, and reporting at the beach site. A set of
samples will be run. Data transmission will also occur as part of this effort. Westat will observe all
activities in detail and record their observations.
Westat will be responsible for determining the results and any corrective action to be taken. After
concurrence with the USEPA, a written report on the final approach to sampling/analysis/reporting
will be provided to the WACOR or COR.
Site Visits/Technical Systems Audits
The USEPA may, at its discretion, perform a site visit at the beach site. The site visits may include
technical systems audits (TSAs). Although any site visit or audit will likely be conducted by USEPA
personnel, the possibility of using contractor support exists. A site visit or audit will be coordinated
with Westat in advance.
Site visitors/auditors may recommend work stoppage if they observe what they deem to be critical
failings on the part of Westat. Such a recommendation will be made to the WACOR or COR and
the contracting officer. Work may only be stopped by the Contracting Officer until such time as
effective corrective measures are implemented, verified effective, and approved.
Following the site visit/TSA, a report will be prepared by the personnel who conducted the visit.
This report will be addressed to the WACOR or COR. Westat will be provided a copy of the report,
and will be required to respond to any corrective action recommendations. Westat will be
responsible for signing-off on the response. A close-out memo will be issued to Westat by the
WACOR or COR following his/her approval of the response. However, USEPA does reserve the
right to revisit any identified problem areas.
Routine Surveillance
Copies of any written reports generated by Westat on routine surveillance will be made available to
the WACOR or COR.
Data Validation and Usability
According to USEPA Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans; USEPA QA/G-5 (6),
"the process of data verification requires confirmation by examination or provision of
objective evidence that the requirements of these specified QC acceptance criteria are
met. In design and development, verification concerns the process of examining the
34



result of a given activity to determine conformance to the stated requirements for that
activity. For example, have the data been collected according to a specified method
and have the collected data been faithfully recorded and transmitted? Do the data
fulfill specified data format and metadata requirements?"
Regarding validation, G-5 states,
"The process of data validation requires confirmation by examination and provision of
objective evidence that the particular requirements for a specific intended use have
been fulfilled: In design and development, validation concerns the process of
examining a product or result to determine conformance to user needs."
Based on these definitions, verification is the responsibility of Westat; however, USEPA reserves the
right to review the verification and will be responsible for validation.
Data Review, Verification, and Validation
All data will undergo several layers of review and verification, which is described in the next section.
The previously described assessments are also a key component of verification. Validation is
primarily considered part of reconciliation with project objectives. General principles guiding
acceptance/selection, verification, and validation of data are discussed immediately below.
All microbiological data will be submitted to the USEPA (i.e., data from all sample volumes or
dilutions, even if zero, uncountable or too numerous to count and all other forms of data, described
above). The USEPA will decide whether or not data are acceptable, and will choose which data are
included in the final data set for the project. The guiding principles for microbial data
acceptance/selection will be:

–

Legible data records.

–

Dates and times correct.

–

Sample IDs correct.

–

Electronic and hard-copy data concur.

–

Results are in an appropriate format.

–

Results reasonable (i.e., not grossly wrong).

–

CFU counts are in the ideal range, whenever possible.

–

Dilutions with CFU counts outside ideal range are not grossly incompatible with
those in the ideal range.

–

Sample holding/analysis times were met.

35



–

Associated QC sample results are acceptable.

–

Specific acceptance criteria for the rapid methods adequate.

For ancillary data, the acceptance factors include:

–

Legible data records.

–

Dates and times correct.

–

Electronic and hard-copy data concur.

–

Results are in an appropriate format.

–

Results reasonable (i.e., not grossly wrong).

–

Associated QC sample results acceptable.

–

Other factors support acceptance (or rejection).

For the remote chemical data the acceptance factors include:

–

Legible ASR forms.

–

Dates and times correct.

–

Samples arrive in good condition at remote laboratory.

Verification and Validation Methods
Verification/Validation Roles and Responsibilities
Westat will inspect forms to see that all appropriate data fields have values entered, and that entries
are legible and reasonable. Westat will also ensure that all planned samples have been collected. The
verification of review will be indicated by entering their initials on the field data sheets in provided
spaces. Westat is responsible for seeing that all forms are present and that they are delivered to the
laboratory.
Westat will verify that all expected samples and field sheets are present upon arrival at the
laboratory. Westat will periodically inspect the record book and make a record of any such
inspections.

36



The laboratory is responsible for verifying that all microbiological (and other laboratory) data fields
are legibly filled out with apparently reasonable data. They will enter their initials and the date in
appropriate fields on the data sheets to indicate their review and acceptance. Spaces for date and
initials will be provided on all data sheets. The laboratory's initials will indicate their inspection and
acceptance of data sheets prior to their delivery to USEPA.
Transmission of deliverables is the de facto indicator that the data were completely reviewed and
believed to be accurate. The laboratory personnel responsible for reviewing the data will be a person
that is different than the person who originally keyed-in the data.
Making Corrections
On any hard copy data sheets, incorrect entries will be singly lined-out (i.e., not obliterated) and
correct results entered. If the party making the correction is not the person who made the original
entry, then the date and initials of the person modifying the entry will be present next to the
correction.

Saliva Samples:
The saliva study will be an additional effort designed to complement the basic NEEAR Water study
which relies on water samples and questionnaires. The saliva study will be conducted at the
Boqueron Beach, Puerto Rico site only. Saliva samples will be collected from active NEEAR water
study participants using a simple sponge with a handle upon after they have completed the Part B
questionnaire at the beach site. Active NEEAR water study participants includes persons who are
actively and successfully participating in the current questionnaire process. Participants who are not
able to complete the questionnaires successfully will become ineligible for the saliva collection.
Participants will be mailed additional sponges to collect and return via mail to investigators 10-12
days and again six weeks later. The saliva sample goal for active NEEAR water study participants is
between 2500-2600 participants, each contributing a maximum of three samples.
The NEEAR Water study targets and offers enrollment to all beachgoers between 11:00 AM and
5:00 PM. Beachgoers are approached by trained interviewers between these hours and asked if they
would like to participate in a survey. Those who agree complete an initial baseline interview. After
the Part B interview is completed, interviewers will ask participants in the NEEAR Water study first
if they would be interested in providing saliva samples. They will briefly describe the study
emphasizing the following points: 1) three samples will be collected, today, after 10 days, and after
six weeks, and tested for germs that cause gastrointestinal and other illness; 2) sample collection is
simple and takes about a minute (they will show the saliva sampling kit); and 3) they will be
reimbursed $10 for each sample and won’t incur any costs for shipping. Participants will be
provided $10 for each saliva sample received, for a maximum of $30.

Choosing the Best
Membrane Filter Count

256



MERB SOP 041
CHOOSING THE BEST MEMBRANE FILTER COUNT FOR THE CALCULATION
OF THE FINAL CONCENTRATION OF MICROORGANISMS PER 100 ML

A count of 20-60 is the ideal counting range for any original Escherichi coli or Enterococcus
membrane filter colony count, regardless of the volume of sample tested. Whether a count falls
within the ideal counting range will ultimately affect the final concentration, but the ideal counting range
does not directly apply to it. To obtain the final concentration, we look at the original counts to determine
which count to use in the calculation; then we adjust by the dilution factor to obtain the final concentration
(colonies/100 milliliters). The detailed procedure is as follows:
1. Look at the actual colony count for the largest volume of sample tested, 100 milliliters in this case.
2. If the count falls within the ideal counting range of 20-60, calculate the final concentration
(colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying the count by the dilution factor. However, when the largest volume
tested is 100 milliliters, the count does not have to be adjusted (that is, the count is the final
concentration). If the largest volume is 10 milliliters or 1 milliliter, the count would have to be multiplied by
10 or 100, respectively.
3. If the count in the largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60 on the
"low side" (that is, < 20), calculate the final concentration (colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying that
count by the dilution factor, if any. If the largest volume is 100 milliliters, the count is the final
concentration. If the largest volume is 10 milliliters or 1 milliliter, that count would have to be multiplied by
10 or 100, respectively.
4. If the count in the largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60 on the
"high side" (that is, > 60), look at the actual colony count for the next (second) largest volume of
sample. In this case, it is 10 milliliters.
5. If the count in the second largest volume of sample falls within the ideal counting range of 20-60,
calculate the final concentration (colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying that count by the dilution factor. In
this case, the dilution factor is 10.
6. If the count in the second largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60 on
the "low side" (that is, < 20) and the count for the largest volume of sample is > 60 but < 100, use
the count from the largest volume rather than the count from the second largest volume to calculate
the final concentration (colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying the chosen count by the dilution factor, if
any. If the largest volume tested is 100 milliliters, the count is the final concentration.
7. If the count in the second largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60
on the "high side" (that is, > 60), look at the count from the next (third) largest volume and repeat the
same steps as in 5-7 . Since the third largest volume is 1 milliliter, the dilution factor is 100.
8. If the count in the third largest volume of sample falls within the ideal counting range of 20-60,
calculate the final concentration (colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying that count by the dilution factor. In
this case, the dilution factor is 100.
9. If the count in the third largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60 on
the "low side" (that is, < 20) and the count for the second largest volume of sample is > 60 but <
100, use the count from the second largest volume rather than the count from the third largest
volume to calculate the final concentration (colonies/100 milliliters) by multiplying the chosen count by the
dilution factor. In this case, the dilution factor would be 10.
10. If the count in the third largest volume of sample is outside the ideal counting range of 20-60 on
the "high side" (that is, > 60), look at the count from the next (fourth) largest volume, if any, and
repeat the same steps as before .
11. If there is no additional (fourth largest) volume and the count for the third largest sample was toonumerous-to-count, record as TNTC, greater than 100 multiplied by the dilution factor for the third
largest sample (100 in this case) or > 10,000.

Westat is submitting this Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) in fulfillment of the

requirements of Work Assignment 0-01, Task 5. Under Work Assignment 0-01, Task 5,Westat conducted
and completed beach water sampling from May 15, 2009 through August 2, 2009 at Boquerón Beach,
Boquerón, Puerto Rico and from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 at Surfside Beach, Surfside,
South Carolina, followed by laboratory analyses and database development. In summary, this QAPP
seamlessly covers the work performed during this task.

1.2

Background Information
In order to meet some of the requirements of the Clean Water Action Plan, the Beach Action

Plan and the Beach Act of 2000, this beach study was initiated in 2003 to assist the Office of Water in
formulating new health and risk guidelines for recreational water.
This study is being conducted jointly by the National Exposure Research Laboratory,
Microbiological and Chemical Exposure Assessment Research Division (NERL/MCEARD), the National
Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).
This information is being collected as part of a research program consistent with the Sec.
3(a)(v)(1) of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 and the strategic
plan for EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Office of Water entitled “Action
Plan for Beaches and Recreational Water.” The Beaches Act and ORD’s strategic plan has identified
research on effects of microbial pathogens in recreational waters as a high-priority research area with
particular emphasis on developing new water quality indicator guidelines for recreational waters. This
data collection is for a series of epidemiological studies to evaluate exposure to and effects of microbial
pathogens in marine and fresh recreational waters as part of the EPA’s research program on exposure and
health effects of microbial pathogens in recreational waters. The information collected by this study
program will be used to estimate the relationship between water quality indicators and health effects. The
questionnaire health data will be compared with routinely collected water quality measurements. The

analysis will focus on determining whether any water quality parameters are associated with increased
prevalence of swimming-related health effects.

1.3

Study Beach Site
The study period from took place from May 15, 2009 through August 2, 2009 at Boquerón

Beach, Boquerón, Puerto Rico and from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 at Surfside Beach,
Surfside, South Carolina. This work assignment implements field procedures for the water quality data
collection at a beach study site and the follow-up telephone interviews. Westat traveled to these sites.

at 843-913-6111.
The beach sites were selected based upon specific criteria listed below:

1.4



The beach was an officially designated recreational area near a large population
center.



The beach generally meets the state or local water quality standards.



The beach was contaminated by a human source of pollution.



The beach has a large attendance (e.g., 300-400 swimmers/day)



The age range of the swimmers was broad (i.e., includes children, teenagers, and
adults).



The swimming season was at least 90 days long.

Project/Task Organization
This study, which was necessary to meet the requirements of the Congressionally-mandated

Beach Act of 2000, was administered out of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s

(USEPA) National Exposure Research Laboratory, Microbiological and Chemical Exposure Assessment
Research Division (NERL/MCEARD), Cincinnati, Ohio. The project was funded by the office of
Research and Development. The water quality monitoring study was conducted by Westat, and the
concurrent health study was conducted and funded by the National Health & Environmental Effects
Research Laboratory (NHEERL), with the assistance of Westat.
Westat assembled a team consisting of experienced Westat environmental researchers,
qualified locally hired staff to collect the water samples and four laboratories to analyze the water
samples. The Westat staff are described in the personnel section of this QAPP. It was necessary to use
four laboratories because some of the analytical methods must be performed within eight hours of the
sample collection, which required a laboratory close to the beaches where sampling took place. In
addition, certain analytical procedures, for example qPCR, require special expertise and licensing, which
was possessed by only relatively few laboratories. Thus, the laboratories were:

Proficiency/Certification
There was no specific training anticipated by USEPA for the current approved membrane

filter Enterococci method (mEI Agar; see References 7 and 8). Westat ensured that analysts were
proficient in the above method and each of the rapid methods [Rapid Quantitative Polymerase Chain
Reaction (QPCR) and Human Specific QPCR (See Reference 9).]. The laboratory analysts who
performed the assays were proficient in each method and consulted with USEPA personnel, the technical
advisors, and the manufacturers of the instruments to ensure proper knowledge and use of the analytical
methods.

Westat required laboratory staff to process one or two performance evaluation samples

(unknowns) for all methods during the study. Westat ensured that the sub-contract laboratories followed
general field and lab safety protocols throughout the study period.

1.6

Safety Protocol
Westat utilized a safety plan specific to EPD-09-040, Work Assignment 0-01.

DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS

Data Deliverables
Westat used sample collection/custody forms, approved by USEPA. Westat maintained

sample collection/custody sheets in a binder in the laboratory where the analysis was performed. Westat’s
laboratories initially recorded membrane filter count data and lot number on field or laboratory
worksheets, then entered and saved data electronically in an Excel spreadsheet. Microsoft Word was used
for the text in reports. The worksheets, database format, data sheets, or spreadsheets for this method and
all other methods in this study were approved by the USEPA. A separate spreadsheet file was employed
for each day of sample collection. The file name incorporated the dates or range of dates of collection.
Separate database forms were used to record the following information:


Field measurement data (See below),



Sample collection time/analysis start time/incubation start and end time (See
Microbiological Method Section), and



Microbiological data for each sample/volume and associated quality control (QC)
samples.

All data from each of the rapid methods (counts, CT values, setup values, plots, growth
curves, graphs, computer files, notes, statistical parameters and analyses, etc.) were recorded, saved, and
submitted to USEPA in a hard copy (where applicable) and in electronic form. A copy of all computer
files was sent to USEPA electronically by E-Mail with a cover letter outlining the contents of the files.
Additions or changes to the worksheet were approved by USEPA.
A hard copy format of hand-entered sample collection and custody sheets, data sheets, and
all other forms of data (graphs, bit maps, CT values, setup values, plots, growth curves, notes, QC data,
statistical parameters and analyses, etc.) for each sampling event was provided to the COR and WACOR
no later than the Monday following each 3-day weekend period (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) of
sampling each week at the beach site. Westat also entered the data electronically into the database
forms/spreadsheets, and, after the analyses were completed at the beach site, the electronic file(s) were
delivered to the COR and WACOR along with all other forms of data (graphs, bit maps, plots, curves,
setup values, notes, QC data, statistical parameters and analysis, etc). The delivery was accompanied by a
brief cover memo outlining the delivery contents by method. The memo also indicated if there were any

unusual circumstances or known problems surrounding the deliverable, such as QC problems in any of
the methods.
Critical data that were reported included the bacterial counts from the membrane filter tests;
the complete run files for the QPCR method, including CT and setup values, positive and negative
controls, etc; the complete run files. All membrane filter plates were examined and counted [If possible,
plates with up to 200 colony forming units (CFUs) were to be considered countable, although the ideal
number of CFUs is 20-80.], and the results for all plates were reported, including zeros and those “toonumerous-to-count” (TNTC). An estimation procedure for TNTC plates were provided to the laboratory
by USEPA. The estimation data from the TNTC plates (i.e., the five counts from five squares on each
filter) was submitted to USEPA along with the count data for the other samples. QC data was reported
with the sample data for all methods.
In addition to the water samples that were collected, ancillary data was collected for each
sampling visit. These are shown in Table 1. Certain ancillary data items were entered using specific
measuring instruments. Table 2 describes the measuring instruments, including model, range accuracy
and calibration procedures. All field data was entered with permanent non-running ink. In addition to the
items detailed in Table 1 and 2, any items/activities specific to the beaches were added.
Any QC results associated with the collection of ancillary data were also reported (QC
samples were specified in Methods/SOPs describing ancillary data collection methods).

Photographic Data
To aid researchers in determining conditions at the beach that may not be readily apparent
from the ancillary data recorded, photographs of the sample locations at the beach area were taken for the
record at least once a day during the sampling period at the beach site. While the work assignment
required taking photographs only once a day, Westat took them at every sample collection, as in past
years, because the conditions on the beach changed substantially over the course of the day from 8:00 am
to 3:00 pm. Photographs were of sufficient quantity and quality to estimate the number of bathers on the
beach and in the water.
Photos were taken with a digital camera. They were labeled with the beach name, date,
target sample collection time, and actual time of photograph. The camera was configured to have the date
(and time, if possible) displayed on the image. The beach name, target sample time, and actual time of
photograph (when unable to configure camera to display on image) were part of the image name.
Submission of photographs to the WACOR or COR occurred at the end of the sampling period for the
beach via appropriate means, expected to be delivery of a CD-ROM with the digital photographs.
Weather Station Data
EPA and Westat setup HOBO Weather Stations at suitable locations near the beach sites to
automatically collect data on sequential weather parameters. At Boquerón Beach, the weather station was
initially setup and tested by EPA Athens on a handicap access ramp on the beach (Figure 1a). However,
EPA moved the weather station prior to the start of the study because the location on the ramp was easily
accessible to potential vandals. EPA Athens relocated the weather station to the top of a lifeguard stand
located on the beach (Figure 1b).

Shortly after the study began, Westat reported that some of the

parameters measured by the Boquerón weather station were not being recorded or were out of normal
range. After a series of attempts to fix the weather station, Westat set-up an additional weather station on
the opposite side of the lifeguard stand (Figure 1c).
Prior to setting up another weather station, Westat made a series of adjustments and
replacements in attempt to alleviate the problematic weather station parts that were not measuring and
recording the data properly. All attempts made to correct the problems were reported to EPA and methods
were developed in consortium with EPA.

On Thursday, June 4, 2009 Westat recognized that rain and barometric pressure data were
not being measured by the device. As a first attempt at troubleshooting the problem, Westat instructed
field staff as well as local Westat tech support staff to check all connections to and from the instrument to
verify that this was not the problem. Westat field staff reported that the cable connections were intact,
and the device was still not measuring rain and barometric pressure. EPA informed Westat that the
weather station manufacturer said that the faulty readings were likely due to bad sensors. EPA suggested
turning switching out the rain and barometric pressure sensors with replacement parts belonging to EPA
and located in the storage facility on site.
On June 11, 2009 Westat instructed field staff to locate the extra rain gauge and pressure
sensor and install them on the weather station. Westat field staff located the replacement parts.
On June 25, 2009 EPA again suggested that the port that connected the sensors might have
been faulty and to switch the ports in which the cables were connected before installing the replacement
sensor parts. Westat instructed field staff to attempt to fix the weather station by testing the rain gauge
and barometric pressure sensors in different ports and to follow up with the replacement of the rain gauge
and pressure sensor if switching ports did not work.
On the June 26, 2009 the cables were tested in all ports by Westat field staff. While all other
parameters were successfully recorded, the rain and barometric pressure data was not recorded. Westat
staff also connected the replacement EPA rain gauge and barometric pressure sensor and found that still
neither parameter was recorded. After testing all of the possibilities, Westat sent another replacement rain
gauge and pressure sensors as well as a replacement logger (that were not in use) from the South Carolina
field office to Boquerón, PR. The Westat replacement rain gauge and barometric pressure sensors were
connected.
On June 28, 2009 Westat field staff forwarded weather station data to Westat home office
which indicated that data for rain and barometric pressure was still not being measured.
On July 9, 2009 Westat field staff examined the weather station again and observed loose
connections in the data logger box. A photograph was taken and sent it to Westat home office. EPA
replied with a photo of where the cables should be connected on the instrument. The next day, field staff
attempted to fix the rain gauge and barometric pressure sensors by connecting to an additional logger.
Westat staff noted that the logger was not measuring rain due to the fact that the cable came out once the

The cable was replaced and the Westat logger was measuring rain and barometric

pressure data.
On July 11, 2009 Westat field staff checked the weather station again and found that all
parameters, with the exception of UV and battery status, were not being recorded by the EPA logger.
Westat’s logger was reading rain data and barometric pressure.
July 13, 2009 EPA suggested a few different methods to troubleshoot the malfunctioning
weather station. Westat tried each suggestion to get the device logging properly, but was unsuccessful.
July 15, 2009 Westat sent all remaining weather station parts from the South Carolina field
house to Boquerón, PR. These replacement sensors were set up on the Westat logger.
July 20, 2009 Westat reported to EPA that the additional weather station was installed and
all parameters were being collected.
In Surfside Beach, the weather station was setup at the end of a fishing pier just south of the
sampling area (Figure 1d).
Westat collected weather parameters/units from May 15, 2009 through August 2, 2009 at
Boquerón Beach, Boquerón, Puerto Rico and from June 6, 2009 through September 7, 2009 at Surfside

DATA GENERATION AND ACQUISTION

Overview of Sample Collection for Microbiological Analyses
Before beginning sample collection at the beach sites, the sampling locations were

identified. These locations were in waist-high water (1 meter deep), shin-high water (0.3 meters deep),
and in wet-sand along pre-selected transects. The transects were lines perpendicular to the shoreline,
selected to represent the water areas frequented by the beachgoers. At both Boquerón and Surfside Beach
there were three transects, with shin-high, waist-high, and wet-sand samples along each transect, for a
total of nine sampling locations (Figure 2a).

Figure 2a. Sample transects schematic

At Boquerón Beach, Westat collected beach water samples on specified weekend (Saturday
and Sunday) sampling days during the study period of May 16th, 2009 through August 2nd, 2009,
including two weekday holidays (Mondays), May 25th, 2009 and July 27th, 2009 for microbiological
analysis by three methods [the current approved membrane filter (MF) Enterococci method (mEI Agar),
Rapid Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR), and for Cyanobacteria analysis].

At Surfside Beach, Westat collected beach water samples on specified weekend (Saturday
and Sunday) sampling days during the study period of June 6, 2009 through Sept. 7, 2009, including two
weekday holidays, Friday July 3, 2009 and Monday, Sept. 7, 2009 for microbiological analysis by two
methods [the current approved membrane filter (MF) Enterococci method (mEI Agar), Rapid
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR)].
Individual Water Samples
Three times a day, at 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM, water samples were collected at
both beach sites along each of the three transects perpendicular to the beach shoreline, one in waist-high
water (1 ml deep) and one in shin-high water (0.3 m deep), for a total of 18 samples collected per day
(i.e., 6 grid locations x three times per day). See Figure 2b, which depicts the water sampling scheme.
Water samples were collected at the points numbered 1 through 6. The location of the transects were at
least 20 meters apart or more, if the area used by the swimmers encompasses more than a total of 60
meters of shoreline.

It was intended that samples were collected on the scheduled dates, but other dates

may have been substituted if rainfall or other problems prevented swimmers from going to the beach,
prevented water sampling, or created hazardous conditions for the field personnel. Sample collectors
notified the WACOR or COR of adverse weather conditions or other problems and requested guidance
whether to begin or continue sampling on a given day or weekend. This was necessary because the
samples needed to be collected when there were sufficient bathers at the beach to allow NHEERL to
conduct their concurrent epidemiological/health study.

Figure 2b. Water sampling locations

Composite Samples
At both beach sites, additional samples were collected at the same six points and at the same
three times of day as the beach water individual samples. These additional samples were used to develop
composite samples. One plastic 1-liter bottle was collected at each of the six locations on the grid in
Figure 2b for microbial analysis. At the lab these samples were combined to create a composite sample,
as described in the “Compositing Samples Protocol” and briefly here:


Two 300 mL portions from the 3 bottles collected at points 1, 3, and 5 were
combined to form two shin composite samples, one for MF and one for PCR.



Two 300 mL portions from the 3 bottles collected at points 2, 4, and 6 were
combined to form two waist composite samples, again, one for MF and one for PCR.



150mL from each bottle collected at points 1-6 was combined to form two total
composite samples, one for MF and one for PCR.

It was intended that samples were collected on the scheduled dates, but other dates may have
been substituted if rainfall or other problems prevented swimmers from going to the beach, prevented
water sampling, or created hazardous conditions for the field personnel. Sample collectors notified the
WACOR or COR of adverse weather conditions or other problems and requested guidance whether to
begin or continue sampling on a given day or weekend. This was necessary because the samples needed
to be collected when there were sufficient bathers at the beach to allow NHEERL to conduct their
concurrent epidemiological/health study.
Cyanobacteria Samples
At Boquerón Beach only, Westat collected water samples in pre-prepared polypropylene
bottles for Cyanobacteria analysis. Specifically, samples were collected from the waist depth location at
each of three transects (sampling points 2, 4, and 6, see Figure 2c) at the 11AM sampling time on
weekend and holiday water sampling days. Nine bottles total were filled. At each of the three sites the
following bottles were filled: two 237 ml bottles, and one 40 ml bottle. At the local lab, 1% Lugols
iodine was added to the 40mL bottle as a preservative. The water collectors completed documentation of
sample collection in an EPA-provided sample log. Samples were refrigerated or kept on ice within 30
minutes of collection and until they were shipped to Green Water Laboratories in Palatka, Florida.
As with the other water samples, it was intended that the cyanobacteria samples were
collected on the scheduled dates, but other dates may have been substituted if rainfall or other problems
prevented swimmers from going to the beach, prevented water sampling, or created hazardous conditions
for the field personnel. Sample collectors notified the WACOR or COR of adverse weather conditions or
other problems and requested guidance whether to begin or continue sampling on a given day or
weekend. This was necessary because the samples were collected when there were sufficient bathers at
the beach to allow NHEERL to conduct their concurrent epidemiological/health study.

Sand Samples:
Westat collected three beach sand samples per day on Saturdays, Sundays, and on weekday
holidays [Monday May 25, 2009 and Monday July 27, 2009 for Boquerón Beach and Friday July 3, 2009
and Monday September 7, 2009 for Surfside Beach] for both beach sites, for microbiological analysis by
two methods [the current approved membrane filter (MF) Enterococci method (mEI Agar) and Rapid
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR)]. These samples were taken in the designated area of
the beach associated with the water quality samples. Westat employed a “scoop” method to collect the
samples.
Westat collected three sand samples per day at 8:00 AM along with the 8:00 AM water
samples. Samples of wet sand were collected 1 meter from the lowest water level (when the waves
receded from the shoreline) at the same 3 transects where water samples were collected. See Figure 2d,
which is a schematic that shows the collection of the water and sand samples at 8:00 am. Sand samples
were collected at points 7, 8 and 9. When the sand was not wet at 1 meter from the water, the sand
collection location was moved the shortest possible distance toward the water to a location where the sand

was wet. Westat recorded the actual distance from the water. Global Positioning System (GPS) readings
of the actual sand collection locations and a photo of the sample collection sites were taken.
As with the water samples, it was intended that sand samples were collected on the
scheduled dates, but other dates may have been substituted if rainfall or other problems prevented
swimmers from going to the beach, prevented water sampling, or created hazardous conditions for the
field personnel. Sample collectors notified the WACOR or COR of adverse weather conditions or other
problems and requested guidance whether to begin or continue sampling on a given day or weekend. This
was necessary because the samples were collected when there were sufficient bathers at the beach to
allow NHEERL to conduct their concurrent epidemiological/health study.

Table 3 details the number of samples collected and Table 4 details the number of samples
analyzed at Boquerón Beach. Table 5 details the number of samples collected and Table 6 details the
number of samples analyzed at Surfside Beach. Any variance in the number of samples collected is due
primarily to weather-related complications that prevented the collection of samples during the planned
collection times. These situations are documented in the following tables.

Determination of Transects
Boquerón Beach, Puerto Rico
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of Boquerón Beach that identifies the transect locations and

corresponding sampling points (numbered as 1-9). The sampling area is defined as points located in the
area within the wheelchair water access structure (far left, when standing on the shore and facing the
ocean) and the long pier (far right, when standing on the shore facing the ocean). Each transect was
identified by the alignment of two permanent structures. Samples 1, 3 and 5 were the shin-depth water
sampling locations. Samples 2, 4, and 6 were the waist-depth sampling locations. Samples 7, 8, and 9
were the sand sampling locations. The left transect was the left-most sampling point when standing on
the shore and facing the water. Samples 1, 2, and 7 were taken at the left transect. The right transect was
the right-most sampling point when standing on the shore and facing the water. Samples 5, 6, and 9 were
taken at the right transect. The center transect was in between the left and right transects. Samples 3, 4,
and 8 were taken at the center transect.

Left Transect – Samples 1, 2 and 7

The left transect was located approximately N 18.01938 and W -67.17223. The structures
used to identify the transect were the furthest most left lifeguard stand (red circle) and a
palm tree (yellow circle) that was located behind it, as shown in Figure 4a, below. The
sample point was defined by the alignment of the center of the ramp on the lifeguard stand
with the palm tree so that the palm tree was in the center of the lifeguard stand. A close-up
view of the structures that defined the left transect can be viewed in Figures 4b and 4c.
Figure 4d depicts the transects lined up. Sample 1 was collected in shin-deep water where
these two structures appear aligned, as in Figure 4d. Sample 2 was collected in waist-deep
water along the same transect. The sand sample 7 was collected one meter from the water’s
edge in wet sand along the same transect.

Center Transect – Samples 3, 4, and 8

The center transect was located approximately N 18.02076 and W -67.17220. The structures
used to identify the transect were the second or center lifeguard stand (red circle) and a palm
tree (yellow circle) that was located behind it, as shown in Figure 5a, below. It was defined
by the alignment of the ramp handrail of the lifeguard platform with the palm tree. The
handrail that was lined up with the tree was the left-side rail (when sampler faced the
lifeguard stand, and had their back to the water). A close-up view of the structures that
defined the center transect can be viewed in Figures 5b and 5c. Figure 5d depicts the
transects lined up. Sample 3 was collected in shin-deep water where these two structures
appear aligned, as in Figure 5d. Sample 4 was collected in waist-deep water along the same
transect. Sand sample 8 was collected one meter from the water’s edge in wet sand along the
same transect.

Right Transect – Samples 5, 6, and 9

The right transect was located approximately 30 feet south of N 18.02201 and W -67.17231.
The transect was identified by two palm trees approximately 30 feet south of the lifeguard
stand (Figure 6a) that are in a line perpendicular to the shoreline. Originally, the transect was
planned to be in front a lifeguard stand, similar to the other transects. However, during
training it was discovered that there were slippery rocks in the water that made collection of
the water samples hazardous. As a result the transect was moved about 30 feet to avoid the
rocks. The front tree is the second large tree to the right of the lifeguard stand, when viewed
from the shore (Figure 6b). The rear tree is several yards behind it (Figure 6c). Figure 6d
shows the two trees lined up. Sample 5 was collected in shin-deep water where these two
structures appear aligned, as in Figure 6d. Sample 6 was collected in waist-deep water along
the same transect. Sand sample 9 was collected one meter from the water’s edge in wet sand
along the same transect.

Figure 7 is a schematic diagram of Surfside Beach that identifies the transect locations and
corresponding sampling points (numbered as 1-9). The sampling area was defined as points
located in the area within 7th Ave N and 2nd Ave N. Each transect was identified by the
alignment of two permanent structures. Samples 1, 3 and 5 were the shin-depth water
sampling locations. Samples 2, 4, and 6 were the waist-depth sampling locations. Samples 7,
8, and 9 were the sand sampling locations. The left transect was the left-most sampling
point when standing on the shore and facing the water. Samples 1, 2, and 7 were taken at
the left transect. The right transect was the right-most sampling point when standing on the
shore and facing the water. Samples 5, 6, and 9 were taken at the right transect. The center

blocked the sand dunes (yellow circle), as shown in Figure 8a, below. It was defined by the
alignment of the far left edge of the condo (when the sampler faced the building/back to the
water) ramp with the fence edge so that the fence was directly in line with the building. A
close-up view of the structures defining the left transect can be viewed in Figures 8b and 8c.

Right Transect – Samples 5, 6, and 9

The right transect was located approximately N 33.60763 and W -78.96815. The structures used to
locate the sampling location were the corner of a yellow house (red line) and the second floor
windows (yellow circle) in the grey house behind the yellow house. Both structures can be viewed in
Figure 10a. The transect was defined by the alignment of the side of the yellow house so that it
blocks the 2 of the 3 windows of the grey house behind it. A close-up view of the structures defining
the center transect can be viewed in Figures 10b and 10c. Figure 10d shows the transects lined up.
Sample 5was collected in shin-deep water where these two structures appear aligned, as in Figure

Sampling Methods
Water Samples:
See Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20th edition (1998),

Section 9060, for recommendations on microbiological sampling (3). Briefly, samples were collected in
waist-high (1 m deep) and shin-high (0.3 m deep) water by serially immersing (2) capped 1000-mL presterilized, polypropylene bottles to the appropriate sample depth, removing the lids and allowing them to
fill, raising them out of the water, and emptying them slightly to allow approximately 1 inch of head
space before replacing the lids. Samples were taken about 1 foot (0.3 m) under the surface of the water in
waist-high water, and shin-high samples were taken 6 inches (0.15 m) above the bottom of the water. The
samples collected near the bottom were taken with care so as not to introduce additional
sand/solids/debris into the samples. Sample plans were only altered in extreme or unusual circumstances.
When alterations of the sample method were considered, the WACOR or COR were notified and
guidance was requested. Westat utilized field protocols from Work Assignment 2-04 of the previous

WESTAT

National Epidemiological and Environmental
Assessment of Recreational Water Study

Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)
Revised Draft

contract. Such field protocols and sampling procedures were submitted to the WACOR or COR for
approval prior to the beginning of the study.
Water samples were collected aseptically, as described above, at each location on the beach
grids (Figure 3 for Boquerón Beach and Figure 7 for Surfside Beach) for microbial analysis:

–

1 liter was used for the membrane filter method and the ancillary measurements
(which were done last to prevent contamination).

–

1 liter was used for the rapid QPCR method.

–

1 liter was used for the composite samples.

–

Two 237 ml bottles and one 40 ml bottle were used for the Cyanobacteria samples at
the 11:00 AM sampling period, at sampling points 2, 4, and 6 only. These samples
were only collected at the Boquerón Beach site.

Following collection, all samples were placed in coolers and maintained on ice during
transport and at 1 - 4° C during the time interval before they were analyzed or shipped. No additional
samples were collected for the determination of pH and turbidity. These measurements were made from
the same samples used for membrane filtration after these analyses were completed to prevent
contamination.
Any problems encountered while sampling or while taking ancillary measurements were
recorded on data collection sheets in comment fields or on additional sheets clearly having identified the
date, time, sample location (on grid) and reported to the WACOR or COR if problems may have
potentially affected the analytical results. In the event of problems, corrective actions taken (where
possible) were documented by the field team leader, along with the results of such actions.
Sand Samples
Westat collected, transported, and processed the sand samples according to the protocol
provided by EPA on April 2, 2007. Sand samples were collected with sterile, 2 inch x 10 inch stainless
steel liners (AMS, American Falls, Idaho, or the equivalent). The liner was pushed into the sand at least 8
inches. The liners were sterilized at the lab by rinsing them with water, wrapping them in aluminum foil
or suitable bag and heating them in the drying oven at 170°C overnight. The liners remained wrapped in
the aluminum foil until use. Liners containing the sand samples were capped at both ends, placed in zip-

lock plastic bags labeled using an alpha-numeric system (See below.), and transported to the laboratory
on ice. Samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C. until analyzed.
In the laboratory, sand samples were aseptically transferred to sterile wide-mouth
polypropylene bottles (500 ml or 1- liter, depending on the quantity of the sand), also labeled using the
simplified version of the usual alpha-numeric labeling system. For each sand sample, 75 grams of sand
was aseptically weighed out in a sterile, pre-tared, wide-mouth 500-ml bottle (using sterile spatulas), and
300 ml of Standard Methods phosphate-buffered rinse/dilution water (3), measured with a sterile
graduated cylinder, was added to each bottle. Each bottle was vigorously shaken 50 times. Immediately
after shaking, some of the contents of the bottle were poured into two sterile 50-ml, disposable centrifuge
tubes (Corning 430829 or the equivalent) and filled to the 50-ml mark. The tubes were centrifuged for 5
minutes at ~3000 rpm (600 x g) to bring down the sand and sediment, and the supernatant was removed
using a sterile pipette and placed in a sterile 100-ml polypropylene bottle for subsequent analysis by
Method 1600 (Reference 8) and the Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) method (Reference
9).
The accuracy of the 50-ml mark on the disposable tubes was checked before the dry run by
randomly choosing 5 tubes from the package, weighing each of the 5 tubes, and recording the weights.
After 50 ml of distilled water was measured with a graduated cylinder and poured into each of the tubes,
the tubes were again weighed. The weight of the distilled water (The difference between the two weights)
in each tube was required to be close to 50 grams. The position of the water meniscus was observed with
reference to the 50-ml mark on the tubes. In addition, 5 randomly chosen, pre-weighed tubes were filled
with distilled water so that the meniscus touched the top of the 50-ml line. The tubes were weighed again
and the weight of the water was determined by difference. For the mark to be accurate, the weight of the
distilled water was required to be close to 50 grams. All results were recorded, and a copy of the results
was sent to the WACOR and Kristen Brenner, the technical point-of-contract for sand analyses.
During the dry run, aliquots of 10 ml and 1 ml of each undiluted sand extract and 1 ml of the
10

-1

– 10

-6

dilutions of each extract in phosphate-buffered dilution water (3) was analyzed by EPA

Method 1600 for Enterococci. The number of filtrations for the actual study was reduced after the normal
range of concentrations in sand were determined during the dry run. Three 20-ml aliquots of each sample
was filtered, and the filters were frozen, as described in the QPCR Method, during the dry run. The sand
extraction method described above and the volumes used for both tests may have been adjusted,

depending on the normal range of concentrations of Enterococci in the extracts during the dry run.
Westat obtained EPA’s approval before changing the protocol or analyzing volumes.

Preparation
On the day prior to collection, all the EPA single-use polyethylene water collection bottles,

stainless steel sand liners, the related forms, Cyanobacteria sample collection bottles (Boquerón Beach
only), and other materials were pre-assembled and pre-labeled for both days of the collection weekend.
These items included:

Once all sample containers for a collection time period were labeled (see Labeling
Procedures), the set of collection containers were put into their respective coolers reserved and labeled for
each time period (8:00, 11:00, and 3:00). The collection bottles and sand containers for the Sunday
collections were first put into storage containers, until after the Saturday collections were completed and
the Sunday collection bottles and sand containers could be transferred to their correct coolers in
preparation for the next day. To assist in preventing the incorrect collection of a sample in the wrong
container, the containers for each time period were separated by sample points and placed in different
mesh bags.
All of the collection materials and supplies such as paper towels, batteries, life vests, life
saver ring, mesh bags to hold collection bottles, scuba gloves, plastic bags to put the water collection
bottles into, paper ties to close the plastic bags, extra polyethylene (EPA), stainless steel liners (sand) and
glass (USGS) water collection bottles were put into a large plastic storage container used to assist in
transporting to the beach collection site.

Sample Handling and Custody
Westat utilized sample collection/custody forms modified from forms used at previous beach

sites as part of the general forms. The distribution of each individual bottle taken at each location on the
beach grid was documented on the custody forms.
Prior to sampling visits, tracking forms were printed by a member of the site project team.
The location, date, target collection time, field staff, and information about all samples to be collected
during that visit was entered on the forms, by hand (or electronically, prior to printing). The forms were
printed on laminated paper suitable for field work. Each cooler used to transport samples from the site to
the lab had a copy of the appropriately completed collection/custody form(s) in it or securely attached to
it. Westat knew in advance how many samples could fit in a given cooler and could, therefore, prepare
specific tracking sheets for each cooler prior to going to the field. When more than one cooler were
needed, the coolers were labeled, and cooler labels were cross-referenced on the appropriate tracking
sheet. Individual bottles for the rapid methods were distributed after the samples were logged in at the
laboratory, and the custody forms were signed by each of the method analysts when portions/aliquots of
the samples were removed.
Additional columns on the tracking forms include the actual collection time, the time
samples arrived at the laboratory, and their storage location. Arrival time at the laboratory was indicated
by entering a time for the first sample on a custody sheet, and drawing a down arrow in the lab arrival
time column for the rest of the samples. The field storage location was filled in this manner.
A different form (or forms) was used to record the dates and times when analysis by QPCR
and filtering began (MF and QPCR), the dates and time plates were placed in the incubator (or filters
were placed in the freezer for the QPCR method), the dates and time samples were removed from
incubation (or freezer for the PCR method), and the analysis results. There were spaces for associated
initials for each of the sequential steps. The various “analysis” times were treated on a batch basis; i.e., a
sample batch was all of the samples brought to the laboratory at the same time for analysis, such as all 6
morning samples.

Labeling Procedures
Microbiological sample containers were labeled with water resistant sample labels. The

sample bottles had IDs with consecutive numbers to facilitate handling in the laboratory and to prevent
errors. However, Westat was responsible for placing the requisite additional information onto sample
bottles at the time of sampling to ensure that the samples could be clearly identified. It was recommended
that the information (or at least alphanumeric information, such as suggested directly below) be added just
prior to or just after sampling, as this would minimize the chance of getting samples in the wrong bottles.
Information added included the date, scheduled and actual time of collection, and some type of
alphanumeric that identified the sampling location, and the method(s) used.
Westat used the following sample labeling scheme for all water and sand samples. This
scheme is the similar to one that has been used in past years for sampling. Microbiological sample
containers will be labeled with water resistant sample labels using the following alphanumeric (10character) scheme (to avoid confusion and duplicate sample numbers):
FMMDDXXNSS
Where:
F designates the beach area. B for Boquerón Beach and S for Surfside Beach
MMDD is the date of the sample collection;
MM is the numeric month (1-12) and
DD is the day (01-31), e.g., 0614 for June 14,
XX is the planned time of day for the sample collection, as follows:
08 = 8:00 am
11 = 11:00 am
15 = 3:00 pm
N is the sample point at the beach;
1-6 for water samples and
7-9 for sand samples
(see Figure 2a)
SS is the method of analysis planned for the sample/bottle number, as
follows:
01 = Membrane Filter Method 1600
02 = QPCR Methods
S1 = Sand container

Westat understood that sample containers could be reused after proper cleaning and
resterilization or bottles, presterilized by the manufacturer, could be used. Westat only used presterilized
bottles. Westat obtained a copy of the manufacturer’s sterilization certificate and/or recorded for each lot
was obtained. In addition, the sterility of a few randomly-chosen bottles from each lot was tested before
field use by adding sterile Trypticase Soy Broth to the bottles, incubating for 48-72 hours at 35° C, and
observing the bottles for bacterial growth. Prior to leaving for the field, the sample team leader checked
to see that there were an appropriate number of sample bottles and sample ID labels for the sampling visit
(Bottles had labels attached prior to sampling, as it was demonstrated that this had no deleterious effects
on the labels.) for the sampling visit. There were extra, unlabeled sample containers, and a means to label
them for back-up purposes. Copies of completed sample collection/custody sheets were provided to the
WACOR or COR daily along with their associated data sheets.

3.3.4

Water Collection at the Beach
All the necessary equipment and coolers (see preparation) were brought to the beach. Then

for each time collection period the appropriate cooler with the collection bottles was taken down on to the
beach and used to store the empty and filled water sample bottles. The sample collection started at the 1st
transect on the left-side of the beach. For each transect, the appropriate mesh bag was taken out with the
correct pre-labeled bottles. To enter the water, the water collectors lined themselves up with the line-ofsite markers for the transect point, and then walked in a straight line out to the appropriate water depth to
collect the samples. The Supervisor marked the GPS coordinates and time for each of the six collection
points while the water collectors collected the water samples. Table 3 summarizes the different samples
collected at the three sampling time periods (8AM, 11AM and 3PM) for both beach sites.

Sample Collection Steps
In the water, the water collectors retrieved from the mesh bag and verified each of the IDs on the
bottles before collecting a sample at each of the six sample points. Staying in-line with the line-of-site
poles and transect points, the water collectors first pointed themselves into the direction of the current and
took the water sample pointing into the current holding the bottle in front of and away from their body.
(See Figures below for more detail).

The water collectors oriented and prepared themselves to collect the water samples pointing into
the direction of the current, away from their body.

2.

The collection bottle ID was checked for each bottle used at each sample point and the cap was
slightly loosened. The cap, however, was NOT removed.

The bottle was submersed to a depth of approximately 6 inches for the shin level sample, and the
cap removed to fill the bottle while holding the bottle perpendicular to the ocean bottom. It was
important to make sure the bottle was not very close to the ocean bottom. The start time of the
sample collection was recorded by the field supervisor on the Water Sample Collection Log.

Figure 14. Removal of excess water
4.

Once the bottle was filled, it was recapped, and brought to the surface, to prevent surface water
contamination. Then a small amount of water was removed, so that the bottle was filled to the
appropriate 1-L mark at shoulder of the collection bottle.

The bottle was tightly re-sealed, taking extra precautions to eliminate extended air exposure, and
the filled collection bottles were placed into mesh bag, until they could be put back in the cooler.

Figure 16. Collection of waist level samples
6.

After the shin samples were collected, the water collectors traveled out (staying in-line with the
transect points and the line-of-site poles) to the 1 meter collection point for the waist level
samples. The collection steps 1 – 5 were repeated. Again, the bottle ID was verified for the
sample point before collection, and the sample was collected into the current.

When repeating steps 1 – 5, field staff also made sure the bottle was only uncapped after being
submerged to the 12 inch collection depth for waist level samples, was recapped before resurfacing the sample (to prevent the sample from being contaminated by surface water), a portion
of the sample was poured out so the sample level was close to the 1-L mark on the shoulder of the
bottle, and the bottle was tightly resealed, to prevent loss of any sample collected.

8.

Then steps 1 – 7 were repeated for the other shin and waist level samples for the other transect
points. NOTE: When collecting the middle transect samples, the water temperature, salinity and
conductivity were measured by submersing the entire probe to the collection point depth and
recording the temperature reading of the water during the sample collection. The average wave
height was also estimated and recorded between the middle sample points.

3.3.5

Sand Collection at the Beach
All the necessary equipment (see preparation) was brought to the beach. For each transect

point, the appropriate cooler with the collection containers was taken down on to the beach and used to
store the empty and filled water sand collection containers. The sample collection started at the 1st
transect on the left-side of the beach. Three sand samples were collected only during the 8:00 AM water
collection time according to the following protocol. The sand samples were transported to the lab in a
cooler and stored in a refrigerator until analyzed.
Saturday and Sunday 8:00 AM Sand Collection:

WESTAT

1.

The sand samples were collected 1 meter from the lowest water level (when the waves
have receded from the shoreline) at the same 3 transects where water samples were to
be collected. The meter stick was laid down on the sand and the sand collection
sleeve was pushed in the ground just at the top of the meter stick, so that the hole
created by the sleeve was not within the meter distance but the edge of the hole was a
meter away. The sand should have been wet. If the sand was not wet at 1 meter from
the water, the sand collection location was moved the shortest possible distance
toward the water to a location where the sand was wet.

2.

The meter stick was used to record the actual distance from the water on the sand
ancillary data sheet once the sampling location had been identified. Also anything
unusual or particular about the sand directly surrounding the sand sampling location
was recorded on the ancillary data form.

3.

A Global Positioning System (GPS) reading of the actual sand collection locations
was taken and the associated GPS recorded name on the ancillary data form was
recorded.

4.

The first plastic bag labeled “7S1” from the cooler was obtained. Then, the covered
sterile stainless steel sleeve was taken out.

5.

The steel sleeve was wrapped in aluminum foil or a paper bag. If it was wrapped in
foil, a knife was used to remove the first two inches of aluminum foil from one end of
the sleeve. The top of the aluminum foil was removed by tracing/cutting 2 inches
from the top and then pulling off the end (similar to opening the top of a wine bottle).
The inside or the lip of the sterile steel sleeve was not touched If it was in a paper bag,
the bag was opened and the sleeve removed, taking care not to touch either end.

6.

The brown paper bag with the sterilized tops was opened. One sterile cap was
removed while trying not to touch any of the other caps as much as possible or
touching the inside or lip of the cap itself.

The sterile cap was attached to the exposed end of the still covered sterile steel sleeve.

8.

The rest of the aluminum foil was removed from the stainless steel sleeve and the
uncapped and now exposed end of the sleeve was not touched.

9.

By hand, the sleeve was pushed straight down into the pre-determined sand sampling
location, at least 8 inches down into the sand. See figure below. If necessary the
rubber-headed mallet was used to tap the sleeve into the sand.

10. The sleeve was pushed into sand until only the cap showed.

The side of the sleeve was tapped to slightly pack sand and the liner was checked that
it had enough sand (it should have had about 8 inches of sand).

After the sand sample was collected, a picture of the sand sampling location was taken
that included the hole where the sand sample was removed and the water’s edge. See

Revised Draft

The above steps 4-15 were repeated for each of the sand sampling locations, the bag
labeled “8S1” was removed for the second transect, and the bag labeled “9S1” was
removed for the third transect.

Ancillary Data
Ancillary measurements listed in Table 1 were collected by a variety of means. Some were

collected by simple observation; others involved the use of equipment, such as pH meters, wind gauges,
and rain gauges. It is noted here that WACOR or COR approval of any deviation in methods was
required.
For any ancillary data collection, especially that involving specific equipment, Westat was
responsible for documenting the exact methods used to collect the data, and to provide information about
the calibration and QC procedures for any equipment. This documentation was provided for approval to
the USEPA WACOR or COR prior to the occurrence of any field sampling.
Appropriate field team members or lab team members were responsible for entering data on
appropriate data collection sheets. Westat may have proposed additional QC activities related to sampling
and analysis in their QAPP and work plan as necessary and appropriate. Any changes from the QC
specified by individual method technical point-of-contacts were confirmed with them before

implementation. The ancillary data was typically taken by the field team supervisor as the water samples
were collected. Due to the nature of the environment where the water collection occurred, the data
collected was put down on a clipboard using plastic-covered forms and a grease pencil. This was to due
to the fact that the actual paper forms might get ruined from the splashing water from waves or from wind
and rain. The data was then transferred from the clipboard plastic sheet covered forms to the real forms
immediately after the sample collection.
The data collected included air temperature and wind speed measured by the handheld
weather monitor, and wind direction using the compass. The UV measurement was made prior to the
start of each sampling time. Then estimates of cloud cover was made, along with an estimated count of
animals on the beach or in the water, the number of boats in the water, number of bathers at the beach or
in the water, amount of debris on the beach or in the water, rainfall measured by the rain gauge, the water
temperature, salinity and conductivity at the middle sample points, current direction and average wave
height, and the GPS point measurements at each sample point during the collection of the first bottle.
Additionally, approximately 5-7 digital pictures were taken of the surrounding area at each transect to
document and serve as backup for the collected ancillary data. If any problem or anything of interest was
located or occurred at the collection site, it was recorded in comments on the collection form, and digital
images were taken, if necessary.
The photographs were downloaded from the cameras to the field office computer and saved
as jpg images with the following file naming convention. The images were backed up onto CD.

3.3.7

After the Collection
After the collection, the water sample bottles sand collection containers were returned to

their respective coolers. Before transport of the samples to the water quality lab, the containers were all

put through a quality control and quality assurance check to ensure all the samples were collected and the
caps on the containers were on tight to prevent a loss of any water sample. The bottles and sand
containers were then placed into plastic bags and tied off with twist ties to prevent any separation of ID
labels and the water bottle samples during transport to the analytical lab. The bottles and sand containers
were put back into the cooler for transport with icepacks all around to cool the samples down. All the
ancillary data was transferred to the proper forms, double-checking to ensure that the data variable values
were correctly transcribed. The Sample Collection Forms were filled out and signed by the sample
collection team members and Lab Transmittal forms were filled out, noting any comments about any
sample collected and initialed by the person who actually collected the sample. The water collector who
was transporting the samples to the lab then signed the Transmittal form denoting that they took custody
of the samples. The field team supervisor performed a QA/QC of these documents and then signed them
after reviewing them. The Lab Transmittal forms were then taken with the water and sand samples to the
analytical lab, where the lab would sign the transmittal form taking custody of the samples from the water
collector for filing with the study documentation and faxing to EPA.

3.3.8

GPS points and GPS ID
The GPS points were marked as way points and stored in the GPS measuring device used

during the water and sand sample collection. After the water and sand sample collection, the points were
retrieved and the data values for each point were recorded on the Ancillary Data forms. To be able to
identify and store each of the marked GPS points, a unique ID scheme was developed and implemented.
At the end of each collection period, or at the end of the day, the GPS IDs originally assigned by the GPS
unit were changed to correspond and uniquely identify the captured GPS points for each collection period
on each of the collection days. Listed below is the labeling scheme used to identify the collection period
and locations of stored GPS points:

MDDPTTL

Where:
MDD was the date of the sample collection;

P was the sample collection point at the beach (1 – 9), and

TT was the planned time of day for the sample collection, using the following:
08 = 8:00 AM
11 = 11:00 AM
15 = 3:00 PM
L is the beach site location (B = Boquerón Beach and S= Surfside Beach)

3.3.9

End of Day /Weekend Procedures
At the end of each collection weekend, several things happened. First, all the collection

forms and logs were photocopied to be sent to EPA. The originals were sent to Westat’s main offices to
be entered into the database maintained at the main campus. Also, the GPS IDs in the GPS unit were
changed to the study IDs, and noted on the Ancillary Data Forms. If water sample collection was to
continue on the next day, such as on Saturdays with collections scheduled to continue on Sundays, the
coolers and mesh bags were rinsed, cleaned, dried and prepared for the following day’s sample collection
(putting the appropriate pre-labeled bottles into the right cooler and mesh bags). The icepacks would also
be wiped down and returned to the freezer to be reused. The digital pictures taken were downloaded from
the camera to the laptop at the end of the day (or sometimes only at the end of the entire collection
weekend). Lastly, if not done already, the all of the Cyanobacteria samples (Boquerón Beach only) were
parafilmed across the cap and neck of the bottle, to prevent any loss of a water sample during storage or
transport.

3.3.10

End of the Collection Weekend Shipping Procedures

Westat’s subcontract laboratories were provided with a document that detailed the required
shipping procedures. The document highlighted the standard shipping procedures for all data, samples,
or filters sent from the local laboratory to the various analytical laboratories during the course of the
Water Quality Study in the summer of 2009.

FedEx overnight priority delivery to their respective locations. On weekends where there was a
Monday holiday, shipments went out on Tuesdays. Integrity of the shipment was maintained by
following the protocol specifications regarding the method for shipping and maintaining the
appropriate temperatures.
Westat’s subcontract laboratories were provided with a flowchart that depicted the process for each
sample from collection through processing or analysis and onto shipping/transport. See Appendix
A, Flowchart of Samples Collected.

Labeling

All child samples were labeled with the waterproof polyester labels supplied by Westat. These labels
were made of the same material as the labels supplied for the collection of the samples. The child
samples included the composited samples and the QPCR filters.

Chain of Custody

All shipments were accompanied with a detailed chain of custody (COC) that indicated every item
that was included in the shipment, number of duplicates, sample id, sampling location, collection
time, freeze time, etc.
A Chain of Custody template (See Appendix B) was provided by Westat for the study
dates. There were separate Chain of Custody for each recipient; the intended recipient was indicated
in the Chain of Custody heading. The information that was pre-filled consisted of the sample ID,
sampling date, nominal collection time, sample location, sample type.
At the laboratory, lab technicians were responsible for completing the following fields
on the Chain of Custody:


Actual number of bottles/filters with that ID;



Actual date processed/analyzed;



Shipping date; and,



Any relevant comments.

As a form of quality control, someone other than they person who packed the shipping
container would double check the shipment and corresponding Chain of Custody to verify that it
was correct.
In addition to the packed Chain of Custody, the subcontract laboratories sent out electronic versions
as well.
Packing and Shipping Bottles and Filters

When packing the shipments, the subcontract laboratory was provided with the
following checklist to ensure a safe shipment and to help maintain the integrity of the sample.

WESTAT



Ensure all bottles/filters are properly labeled.



Seal the bottle caps and necks with parafilm or electric tape.



Double-bag each bottle in sealed zip-lock bags. This is not needed for the QPCR
filters, since they were packed in compartmentalized shippers.



Individually wrap each bottle in bubble wrap or other protective container/packing
material. This was not needed for the QPCR filters.



Place plenty of ice or ice packs or dry ice (as appropriate) on the bottom and sides
of the cooler or shipping container.

Sample-Specific Procedures and Shipping Requirements

The following paragraphs describe the specific shipping requirements that were
followed for the different type of items that were shipped throughout this study.
Data Sheets and Lab Transmittal Forms: The local lab shipped copies of all
laboratory transmittal forms and data sheets (MF results, ancillary data, pH and turbidity reading) to
Westat on the Monday or Tuesday after all analyses were complete.
Sand Samples: Sand samples collected during the 8AM sample collection time on
Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays during the study period were taken to the local lab for analysis via
MF and processing for PCR. Prior to processing the sand, 300g of each sample was ascetically
weighed out and transferred to a separate plastic container. These sand samples (created from the
parent sand samples) were stored until in the lab refrigerator, until shipped on Monday. During the
Monday shipment the samples were sent on ice packs to the USEPA Lab in Chapel Hill, NC.
PCR Filters: PCR filters were frozen and stored at temperatures of at least -20º C until
shipped on Monday. Filters were sent frozen and on dry ice to EMSL Laboratories in Westmont,
NJ, USEPA Lab in Athens, GA, and the USEPA Lab in Cincinnati, OH. Filter blanks were sent
along with the samples, one blank filter for every 6 samples was shipped, in accordance with the
June 5, 2009 email from Kris Brenner. Filter blanks were included on the chain of custody forms.

ANALYTICAL METHODS

Following collection, samples were maintained on ice during transport and at 1 - 4° C until
the time of analysis. This was the only preservation step. Microbiological analysis of water and sand
samples commenced within six hours of collection. Further, it was critical that sample plates from the
membrane filter methods be placed in the incubator within eight hours of sampling.

This was

accomplished for all samples. In the event of any problems or irregular occurrences, it was imperative that
the WACOR or COR be called immediately for guidance, and that the comments fields on the various
data sheets was used to record problems/corrective actions, so that the effect on data quality could be
considered. Examples of problems that could occur included sampling difficulties, failure to ice-down
samples, missed holding/analysis times, longer than acceptable incubation times, problems with the
instruments, etc.
With the rapid QPCR method, the critical step was the filtration of the water samples and
storage of the filters in the freezer within the 8 hours after collection. Once the filters were frozen,
analysis could be done as the time allowed. Again, this was accomplished for all samples. The times the
QPCR method filters were frozen and stored, the location of the freezer(s), and the dates and times of the
analyses were recorded. If QPCR filters were analyzed in another lab, they were shipped by overnight
express on dry ice. The other laboratory conformed to the QC requirements of this document. Problems
with the rapid methods, like those with the filter methods, were reported and guidance requested from the
WACOR or COR.
Samples were disposed of following successful microbiological processing by each of the
microbial methods, including the counting of all plates, successful pH, conductivity, salinity and turbidity
measurements, and completed analysis of samples by all methods except for the QPCR method.
However, QPCR samples were filtered and the filters frozen before the disposal of the samples. The
WACOR or COR was contacted about the disposition of the samples if unusual results were obtained.
Westat maintained a dedicated sample record book that was used to record all sample IDs as
samples were checked into the laboratory. The record book also had columns for date checked in, storage
locations, and disposal dates. Westat was responsible for ensuring that all sample IDs were recorded and
initialed the record book for each batch of samples received to indicate that all expected samples were
present. The USEPA could request that the record book or copies of pages from this record book be made

available for examination. Westat was also responsible for verifying that the arrival time at the laboratory
was entered in the appropriate column on the sample collection sheets, and initialed sample collection
sheets in the appropriate space(s) to indicate such, and noted any leaking containers or other irregularities.

4.1

Microbiological Methods

4.1.1

Standard Membrane Filter Method Enterococci (Method 1600)
Reference 8, EPA/821/R-97/004, describes the membrane filtration assay for Enterrococci.

This method can also be found in Reference 7: “Improved Enumeration Methods for Recreational Water
Quality Indicators: Enterococci and Escherichia coli,” EPA/821/R-97/004. These references are detailed
enough, including descriptions of required equipment, so that the membrane filter method can be
performed. As such, these two references represent the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the
critical membrane filter data to be obtained from the field study. A 1-liter sample was collected for use in
performing the filtration method and the ancillary pH, conductivity, salinity and turbidity measurements,
which was performed last to avoid contamination. All collected samples were analyzed for Enterococci
by the MF method using sample volumes of 100, 10 and 1 mL [except for special circumstances; for
example, if plates at the standard sample volumes were all TNTC, or produced zero CFUs, then sample
volumes needed to be adjusted.] In the event that the laboratory needed to adjust the volumes, the
adjustment and documentation of reason was indicated in the records submitted to the USEPA. Analysis
of each sample was initiated within 6 hours of its collection, and processing (filtration and plating) was
completed no later than 8 hours after collection.
Specific QC requirements to be incorporated into the assays (in place of the general
guidance in the methods) can be found in the next section of this plan. Table 8 summarizes some of the
key features of the method. Any modifications to the method, such as using auto-pipets or micro pipets
instead of standard glass pipets, was approved by the WACOR or COR prior to being implemented. Any
other questions regarding the methods were also addressed to the WACOR or COR prior to the start of
field activity.

On the sample collection/tracking sheets and final data sheets, laboratory analysts were
responsible for entering times and their initials for the following sequential steps:

–

Analysis start time.

–

Time at which plates being incubation in the water bath.

–

Time at which plates are removed from the water bath for counting.

These times were entered by hand initially, and later entered into the database electronically.
The times listed above, and initials, were entered in a batch-wise manner. The laboratory was also
responsible for entering dilution data, count data, QC data, etc. on data sheets. Responsibility for
electronic data entry was determined by Westat.
Samples were analyzed in batches. A batch was considered to be all of the samples that were
delivered to the laboratory at the same time. The plates for each batch of samples started their incubation
periods at the same time, and the microbiological control samples described below under “specific
filtration control tests” accompanied each analysis batch.

For the membrane filter assay, the most critical quality control requirements are as follows:

–

Prior to any sampling/filtering, an appropriate volume of TSA [Tryptic Soy
Agar/Trypticase Soy Agar (Difco 0369-17-6, BD 4311043, Oxoid CM 0129B, or the
equivalent)] was prepared, and tested as described below. These plates were later used
for QC samples during sample runs. The recipe for TSA and the contamination
screening for TSA plates is described below:
Composition:
Tryptone
Soytone
NaCl
Agar

15 g
5g
5g
15 g

Preparation: Add the dry ingredients listed above to the 1000 mL of reagent-grade
distilled water, and heat to boiling to dissolve the agar completely. Autoclave at 121
C (15 lbs pressure) for 15 min. Dispense the agar into 9 x 50 mm petri dishes (5
mL/plate).
Test for contamination: Incubate all plates for 24 - 48 hr at 35 C to check for
contamination. Discard any plates with growth. If  5% of the plates show
contamination, discard all plates, and make new medium. Store plates in plastic bags
at 4C until needed. The final pH was 7.3  0.2. Records of preparation and testing
were maintained, and were submitted to the WAM upon request.

WESTAT

–

Each batch of mEI agar was pre-tested for performance (i.e., correct enzyme reaction)
with known cultures of target (e.g., Enterococcus faecium or Enterocococcus fecalis)
and non-target (e.g., Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas species) organisms. Records of
such tests were maintained by the laboratory and was submitted to the COR and
WACOR upon request.

–

Specific filtration control tests, listed below, were performed each time a batch of
samples was analyzed, and the results recorded. Results for all filter, agar or buffer
controls, including counts (if any), were reported with the sample results.

–

Filter Control: Place one or more membrane filters on sterile TSA plates, and incubate
the plates for 24 hours at 35 C. Absence of growth indicates sterility of the filter(s).

–

Phosphate-Buffered Dilution Water Controls: Filter a 50-mL volume of sterile
dilution water before beginning the sample filtrations and a 50-mL volume of dilution
water was filtered after completing the sample filtrations. Place the filters on TSA
plates, and incubate the plates for 24 hours at 35 C. Absence of growth indicates
sterility of the dilution water.

–

Agar Control: Place one or more plates of each medium, mEI and TSA, in the
incubator. Incubate mEI at 41 C and the TSA at 35 C for 24 hours to check for
contamination. Absence of growth indicated sterility of the plates.

–

Optional membrane test: Test new lots of membrane filters against an acceptable
reference lot using the method of Brenner and Rankin (4). Although optional, this test
was recommended. In lieu of performing this test, the laboratory purchased filters
from a reputable source. The USEPA has found (by the method referenced) that
Sartorious filters have generally provided satisfactory performance; however, this
does not mean other filters were unacceptable.

There were no specific sample IDs for the specific filtration control samples. On the hard
copy format batch analysis sheets, their results were reported with the following codes:
YYZ (MEDIA), where,
YY =

AC, PB, or MF (for Agar Control, Phosphate Buffer dilution water controls, or
Membrane Filter control).

Z=

B or A, or nothing (used only for phosphate buffer dilution water controls; B for
“Before filtering” control, A for “After filtering” control).

(MEDIA) = mEI or TSA, the medium used for the control.
The methods contain other specific QC elements, such as requirements for laboratory water
quality, specifying that thermometers be NIST-traceable, calling for daily confirmation of incubator and
water bath temperatures. Such method specifications were adhered to, and the adherence documented. All
autoclave runs contained maximum-registering thermometers to ensure appropriate temperatures were
achieved. Additionally, at least weekly, autoclave runs contained spore strips or vials, which were
incubated according to the manufacturer’s instructions to check for proper sterilizer operation. Calibration
records were maintained for laboratory balances, pH meters, etc.
The method SOP contained procedures for verifying the correct identities of organisms.
Verification tests were performed for all samples (5 colonies/sample) from one day (either Saturday or
Sunday) of the first weekend (6 sample locations x 3 times per day x 1 day = 18 samples total) at the
beach site. Results of the verification tests were recorded and reported to the WACOR or COR with the
other sample data in a mutually agreed upon manner.
It was expected that laboratories would follow generally accepted good microbiology
laboratory practice, such as described in the USEPA Microbiology Methods Manual, Part IV, C (1);

Section 9000 of the 20th edition of Standard Methods (3); or the QC section of the USEPA’s “Manual for
the Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Drinking Water” (5). Copies of any records associated with
standard laboratory QC practices were made available to the USEPA upon request.

4.1.2

Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) Method
Reference 9 describes the procedures for the detection of total Enterococci and total

Bacteroides in water samples based on the collection of these organisms on membrane filters, extraction
of their total DNA, and polymerase change reaction (PCR) amplification (i.e., a process whereby the
quantity of DNA is doubled in each cycle of amplification) of a genus-specific DNA sequence using the
TaqMan PCR product detection system. The TaqMan system signals the formation of PCR products
by a process involving the breakdown of a double-labeled fluorogenic probe that specifically attaches to
the target sequence at a site between the two PCR primer recognition sequences. The reactions were
performed in a specially-designed thermal cycling instrument that automated the detection and
quantitative measurement of the fluorescent signals produced by probe degradation during each cycle of
amplification. These signals were directly related numerically to the quantities of PCR products produced.
The protocol was detailed enough, including descriptions of required equipment, so that the
method could be performed. As such, this reference represents the standard operating procedure (SOP) for
the critical data obtained from this portion of the field study. A 1-liter sample was collected for use in this
method. All collected samples were analyzed for total Enterococci and total Bacteroides using sample
volumes of 100 mL [except for special circumstances; for example, if this volume was found to be
impractical to filter, then sample volumes may have been adjusted]. Filtration of each sample was
initiated within 6 hours of its collections. Seven (7) replicate filtrations were performed, and the filters
were transferred to extraction tubes, as described in the protocol and stored at -20 C for an indefinite
period. All filters were properly labeled to identify the water sample they came from.
The local lab performed the 7 replicate filtrations and shipped 3 filters to the PCR lab, 2
filters to Dr. Richard Haugland of USEPA, and 2 filters to Dr. Mariosa Molina of USEPA. All silters
were sent by overnight express on dry ice on the Monday following the weekend the samples were
collected.
The PCR lab performed the extraction to obtain DNA to be used for QPCR analyses for all
microorganisms (total Enterococci and total Bacteroides) as soon as possible using only one of the

filters, and two filters were stored in the freezer as backups or for other/later analyses. At the end of this
study, all remaining frozen filters were sent on dry ice by overnight express to Dr. Richard Haugland of
the USEPA.
Specific quality control (QC) requirements that were incorporated into these analyses are
listed below, as well as those in the method protocol.

WESTAT

–

QC requirements for sample collection and filtration are specified in the
Microbiological Methods section.

–

Cell suspensions of the calibrator strains, Enterococcus faecalis, American Type
Cutlure Collection (ATCC) 29212, Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, and reference
strain, Geotrichum candidum, University of Alberta Microfungus Collection and
Herbarium (UAMH) 7836, were provided to the laboratory by the USEPA. The cell
suspensions provided were stored by the laboratory at -20 C, or preferably at -70 C,
until used. Preliminary QPCR analyses were performed using four tubes of these
suspensions prior to the start of the study, and the results (CT values and run files)
were reported to USEPA. Subsequent average results for these samples on each day of
analysis were within +2 CT units of the average of the initial values (See paragraph
below on monitoring the performance of the thermal cycling instrument and PCR
reagents).

–

Training for the laboratory on the highly specialized scientific PCR equipment was
provided by the government for validity of data. Westat was responsible for ensuring
that the PCR technician had documented experience in QPCR technology.

–

Westat purchased PCR reagents, including primers and fluorescently-labeled probes.
Primer and probe sequences were provided by the USEPA.

–

Thermal cycling instrumentation (SMART Cycler TD System, Cepheid, Sunnyvale,
California) was provided by the USEPA. Westat monitored the performance of the
thermal cycling instrument and PCR reagents based on ongoing calibrator sample
analysis results. (See above.) In the event of failure to meet these performance criteria,
Westat prepared and analyzed a new set of calibrator extracts, identify the source of
the problem (e.g., reagents or instruments), and take corrective action.

–

Westat provided adequate facilities and carry out precautions necessary to minimize
the likelihood of DNA contamination. Manipulation of samples and reagents was
performed in laminar flow hoods or workstations with UV light sources, and the areas
were disinfected before and after each use with 10% bleach. Disposable aerosol
barrier pipette tips were used for all liquid transfers. Tubes and other disposables that
were not sterilized by the manufacturer were autoclaved before use. All supplies and
disposables were DNA-free. Distilled water and other reagents were verified to be free
of target DNA in negative control analyses performed with each set of sample
analyses.

–

All pipettors used were calibrated prior to commencing work and on a semiannual
basis afterwards. It was recommended that the pipette calibration be verified weekly
by weighing several different amounts of water (in the ranges use) pipetted into a
properly tared container.

This work assignment also included four other combinations of reagents that were
tested for each organism by PCR method.

QUALITY CONTROL (QC)

The most critical elements of quality control for the membrane filter method were those
related to the microbiological assays. Sampling was straightforward; Westat was required to ensure that
the proper samples were taken in the appropriately labeled containers. Holding time of samples was
considered critical. Samples that had not been placed in the water bath in the membrane filter method or
completely filtered and placed in the freezer for use in the QPCR method within eight hours of collection
was considered to have produced invalid data. (However, all data was collected, compiled, and reported
to USEPA). The intent of this project was to collect all of the data for subsequent evaluation by the
USEPA project team, who ultimately determine its utility based on their collective expertise and
experience. No data was rejected outright by the persons performing the analysis. All data, including TooNumerous-To-Count’s (TNTC) and zero’s in the membrane filter methods, was reported to the USEPA.
An estimation procedure for TNTC plates was provided to the laboratory by USEPA. The estimation data
from the TNTC plates (i.e., the five counts from five squares on each filter) were all submitted to USEPA
along with the count data for the other samples. Westat calibrated and maintained the instruments
according to the methods and/or the manufacturer’s recommendations. Westat followed accepted good
microbiology laboratory practice and maintained QC records. Westat participated in all QA audits
conducted, and ran one or more performance evaluation samples provided by the USEPA. Westat
contacted the WACOR or COR when problems occurred and documented corrective actions taken in a
report.

5.1

Corrective Actions
Failure to meet any QC requirements, including those associated with standard good

laboratory practice, requires that appropriate corrective actions be taken. All QC failures, associated
corrective actions, and their effectiveness, were documented on a corrective action form, and submitted to
the USEPA WACOR or COR as part of the weekly reports. Data associated with quality control problems
was clearly identified in such reports, along with an assessment as to the QC failure’s potential effect(s)
on data quality. The WACOR or COR was notified of such problems/corrective actions as soon as
possible to the time of the actual occurrence. All related sample and ancillary data was still reported in the
standard way, with the QC problems clearly noted on copies of the data deliverables.

Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)
Revised Draft

Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, and
Maintenance
Any SOP for equipment/instrument which Westat was required to develop or provide

described standard maintenance procedures for equipment. Maintenance records were described in the
SOPs, and were made available to USEPA upon request, including monitoring records of basic equipment
such as incubators, refrigerators, etc.
For any equipment that might have affected critical data (i.e., microbiological or ancillary
data), Westat prepared a short report for the WACOR or COR describing how the equipment was
inspected and tested upon receipt. The report was delivered within two weeks of equipment being placed
in service.

5.3

Instrument/Equipment Calibration and Frequency
Any SOPs for instruments and equipment which Westat may be required to develop or

provide would fully describe calibration and calibration verification procedures. This included reference
to any calibrations conducted using certified equipment and/or standards with known valid relationships
to nationally recognized performance standards. Field instruments/gauges and laboratory measuring
equipment, such as balances and volumetric measuring devices (e.g., micropipettes), were professionally
serviced/certified within the six months prior to the commencement of the field/laboratory activities for
this project.

5.4

Tracking and Inspection/Acceptance of Supplies and
Consumables
Westat had a system for tracking supplies, reagents, etc., and submitted its procedures to the

WACOR or COR for approval prior to the start of the field season.
The membrane filter methods describe the minimum requirements for the quality of
chemicals and laboratory water. Quality control procedures for laboratory water outlined in the USEPA
drinking water certification manual (5) were recommended. Westat maintained basic records (i.e.,
resistively readings, filter changes, etc.) for their laboratory water systems.

The optional (but recommended) filter test (2); previously described, may be employed to
test new membrane filter lots. All media prepared was routinely tested for sterility.
The goal was to have a clear association of all microbiological data with specific lots of all
materials employed in performing analyses. All records associated with materials tracking and
preparation were made available to USEPA upon request.

5.5

Data Management
Some elements of data management for field data and laboratory data were previously

outlined. Westat initially hand-entered results on pre-printed forms that were approved by USEPA.
On an approximately daily basis, completed hand-entered data sheets were sent to the
WACOR or COR. Weekly submissions were also submitted to the WACOR or COR.
Westat maintained original copies of sampling and data worksheets until instructed by the
WACOR or COR on the deposition of the worksheets. Westat maintained two copies, on separate storage
media, of electronic versions of data until instructed by the WACOR or COR on the disposition of the
data.

5.6

Readiness Review/Dry Runs
At least one week prior to actual sampling, sampling/analysis personnel performed a

readiness review/dry run at the beach site. USEPA representatives attended. A checklist modified in Work
Assignment 2-04, under the previous contract, was utilized by Westat that detailed all equipment,
supplies, worksheets, logbooks, etc. required to conduct sampling, ancillary data collection,
microbiological analysis and data recording, and reporting at the beach site. A set of samples was run.
Data transmission also occurred as part of this effort. Westat observed all activities in detail and recorded
their observations.
Westat was responsible for determining the results and any corrective action that needed to
be taken. After concurrence with the USEPA, a written report on the final approach to
sampling/analysis/reporting was provided to the WACOR or COR.

Site Visits/Technical Systems Audits
The USEPA performed a site visit at the beach site. The site visit included a technical

systems audit (TSAs). The site visit or audit was coordinated with Westat in advance.
Site visitors/auditors may recommend work stoppage if they observe what they deem to be
critical failings on the part of Westat. Work may be stopped until such time as effective corrective
measures were implemented, verified effective, and approved.
Following the site visit/TSA, a report was prepared by the personnel who conducted the
visit. This report was addressed to the WACOR or COR. Westat was provided a copy of the report, and
was required to respond to any corrective action recommendations. Westat was responsible for
signing-off on the response. A close-out memo was issued to Westat by the WACOR or COR following
his/her approval of the response. However, USEPA reserved the right to revisit any identified problem
areas.

5.8

Routine Surveillance
Copies of any written reports generated by Westat on routine surveillance was made

available to the WACOR or COR.

DATA VALIDATION AND USABILITY

According to USEPA Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans; USEPA QA/G-5
(6),
"the process of data verification requires confirmation by examination or provision of
objective evidence that the requirements of these specified QC acceptance criteria are met.
In design and development, verification concerns the process of examining the result of a
given activity to determine conformance to the stated requirements for that activity. For
example, have the data been collected according to a specified method and have the
collected data been faithfully recorded and transmitted? Do the data fulfill specified data
format and metadata requirements?"
Regarding validation, G-5 states,
"The process of data validation requires confirmation by examination and provision of
objective evidence that the particular requirements for a specific intended use have been
fulfilled: In design and development, validation concerns the process of examining a
product or result to determine conformance to user needs."
Based on these definitions, verification is the responsibility of Westat; however, USEPA
reserves the right to review the verification and will be responsible for validation.

6.1

Data Review, Verification, and Validation
All data were subjected to several layers of review and verification, which is described in the

next section. The previously described assessments were also a key component of verification. Validation
was primarily considered part of reconciliation with project objectives. General principles guiding
acceptance/selection, verification, and validation of data are discussed immediately below.
All microbiological data was submitted to the USEPA (i.e., data from all sample volumes or
dilutions, even if zero, uncountable or too numerous to count and all other forms of data, described
above). The USEPA would decide whether or not data are acceptable, and chose which data were to be
included in the final data set for the project. The guiding principles for microbial data
acceptance/selection were:

–

Verification and Validation Methods
Westat inspected forms to see that all appropriate data fields had values entered, and that
entries were legible and reasonable. Westat also ensured that all planned samples had been collected. The
verification of review was indicated by entering their initials on the field data sheets in provided spaces.
Westat was responsible for seeing that all forms were present and that they were delivered to the
laboratory.
Westat verified that all expected samples and field sheets were present upon arrival at the
laboratory. Westat periodically inspected the record book and made a record of any such inspections.
The laboratory was responsible for verifying that all microbiological (and other laboratory)
data fields were legibly filled out with apparently reasonable data. The verifier entered their initials and
the date in appropriate fields on the data sheets to indicate their review and acceptance. Spaces for date
and initials were provided on all data sheets. The laboratory's initials indicated their inspection and
acceptance of data sheets prior to their delivery to USEPA.
Transmission of deliverables was the de facto indicator that the data were completely
reviewed and believed to be accurate. The laboratory personnel responsible for reviewing the data was a
person that was different than the person who originally keyed-in the data.

6.2

Making Corrections
On any hard copy data sheets, incorrect entries were singly lined-out (i.e., not obliterated)

and correct results entered. If the party making the correction was not the person who made the original
entry, then the date and initials of the person modifying the entry was present next to the correction.

High Sensitivity of Children to Swimming-Associated
Gastrointestinal Illness
Results Using a Rapid Assay of Recreational Water Quality
Timothy J. Wade,a Rebecca L. Calderon,a Kristen P. Brenner,b Elizabeth Sams,a Michael Beach,c

Background: Culture-based methods of monitoring fecal pollution
in recreational waters require 24 to 48 hours to obtain results. This
delay leads to potentially inaccurate management decisions regarding beach safety. We evaluated the quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (QPCR) as a faster method to assess recreational water
quality and predict swimming-associated illnesses.
Methods: We enrolled visitors at 4 freshwater Great Lakes beaches,
and contacted them 10 to 12 days later to ask about health symptoms
experienced since the visit. Water at the beaches was polluted by
point sources that carried treated sewage. We tested water samples
daily for Enterococcus using QPCR and membrane filtration (EPA
Method 1600).
Results: We completed 21,015 interviews and tested 1359 water
samples. Enterococcus QPCR cell equivalents (CEs) were positively
associated with swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GI) illness
(adjusted odds ratio per 1 log10 QPCR CE ⫽1.26; 95% confidence
interval ⫽ 1.06 –1.51). The association between GI illness and
QPCR CE was stronger among children aged 10 years and below
(1.69; 1.24 –2.30). Nonenteric illnesses were not consistently associated with Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure, although rash and
earache occurred more frequently among swimmers. Enterococcus
QPCR CE exposure was more strongly associated with GI illness
than Enterococcus measured by membrane filtration.
Conclusions: Measurement of the indicator bacteria Enterococci in
recreational water using a rapid QPCR method predicted swimmingassociated GI illness at freshwater beaches polluted by sewage

t would be useful to monitor recreational waters continuously for human pathogens as a way to prevent swimmingassociated infections. However, there is considerable difficulty and expense associated with testing for the vast number
of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Instead, fecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Enterococcus are
used to assess the microbial safety of recreational waters.
These indicator bacteria are generally not harmful but can be
a marker for the presence of sewage and human feces, and the
health risks that result from such exposures. Because currently used methods require 24 to 48 hours to obtain results,
monitoring does not immediately detect changes in exposure,
leading to delays in notifying beach-goers of possible risks.
A faster method of measuring water quality could
improve protection of public health by reducing the time
between exposure measurement and management decisions,
potentially providing same-day results before most beachgoers enter the water. We previously reported that a faster
method of measuring fecal indicator bacteria using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) showed promise in its
ability to predict swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GI)
illness.1 After sample collection and transport, the QPCR
method can be performed in 3 hours or less. With further
improvements this may be shortened to 2 hours or less.2
We expand on our previous analysis to include 2
additional freshwater beaches, an assessment of nonenteric
illnesses (upper respiratory illness 关URI兴, rash, eye irritations,
and earaches), and separate analyses by age.

METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a prospective study of visitors to freshwater Great Lake beaches on Lake Michigan and Lake Erie
during the summers of 2003 and 2004. The data collection

375



Wade et al

methods have been described previously.1 In brief, we attempted to enroll all beach-goers between 11:00 AM and 5:00
PM during summer weekends and holidays. We excluded
unaccompanied minors (below 18 years) or those who could
not speak English or Spanish. We interviewed volunteers as
they were leaving the beach to ascertain information about
swimming and other activities. Ten to 12 days later, one of
the adults in the household was interviewed by telephone
about health symptoms experienced by participating household members. All subjects provided oral consent. The study
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Beach Descriptions
Human-derived pollution sources generally cause the
most health concern,3 and beaches with such pollution were
the focus of these studies. In 2003, we conducted studies at
West Beach (on Lake Michigan in Indiana Dunes National
Seashore in Indiana) and Huntington Beach (on Lake Erie
near Cleveland, OH). In 2004, we studied 2 additional Lake
Michigan Beaches: Silver Beach, near St. Joseph, Michigan,
and Washington Park Beach in Michigan City, Indiana. The
range of fecal indicator-bacteria concentration at these
beaches is related to contamination by effluent from sewage
treatment plants. Water quality at each beach was influenced
by point-source tributaries that received combined treated
sewage treatment discharges from communities with populations of at least 38,000 and with flow rates of over 10 million
gallons per day (see Appendix A, available with the online
version of this article, for additional details). These sewage
plants provided secondary treatment as well as disinfection
with chlorine or ultraviolet radiation during the summer.

Water Sample Collection and Sample Analysis
Water samples were tested for fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus and Bacteroides using QPCR. Because of
problems in the sensitivity of the Bacteroides QPCR assay,
the data in 2004 were insufficient to assess this indicator in
relation to health effects. Samples were also tested for
Enterococcus using EPA Method 1600,4 one of the culture-based methods currently recommended by the EPA
for recreational freshwater monitoring.5
We collected water samples at 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and
3:00 PM, along 3 transects perpendicular to the shoreline—
one sample in waist-high water (1 m deep) and one in
shin-high water (0.3 m deep). Transects were located at least
60 m apart to encompass the swimming area. Because rock
jetties at Huntington Beach prevented free circulation of
water, we collected 4 additional samples at each sampling
time to better characterize the water quality. Following collection, samples were placed in coolers and maintained on ice
at 1 to 4°C. Analyses of samples by Method 1600 for
Enterococcus were performed by local laboratories within 6
hours of collection. Samples were filtered for QPCR analysis

376

Epidemiology • Volume 19, Number 3, May 2008

within 6 hours of collection. To ensure consistency across the
4 beaches, the filters were frozen and sent on dry ice by
overnight express for analysis by EMSL Analytical, Inc.
Laboratory (Westmont, NJ).
The QPCR method used in this study has been previously described.1,6 In brief, organisms in water samples were
collected by membrane filters, total DNA was extracted, and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a genusspecific DNA sequence of Enterococcus was carried out
using the TaqMan PCR product detection system. The reactions were performed in a thermal cycling instrument (SmartCycler System, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) that automated the
detection and quantitative measurement of the fluorescent
signals produced by probe degradation during each cycle of
amplification. Ratios of the target sequences in a test sample
were compared with a calibrator sample using an arithmetic
formula, referred to as the Comparative Cycle Threshold
Method.7 These ratios were converted to measurements of
calibrator cell equivalents in test samples through the use of
calibrator samples processed in the same manner as the test
samples and containing a known quantity of the target organism cells. Results are reported in QPCR cell equivalents
(QPCR CE) per 100 mL of original sample.
At each sampling time we recorded environmental
conditions, including air and water temperature, cloud cover,
rainfall, wind speed and direction, wave height, beach population density, boats, animals (number and type), and debris.

Health Assessments
We assessed 5 endpoints, defined a priori, and similar
to those previously studied.8 –13
1. “Gastrointestinal illness” (GI illness) was defined as any
of the following: diarrhea (three or more loose stools in a
24-hour period); vomiting; nausea and stomach ache;
nausea or stomach ache, and interference with regular
activities (missed time from work or school, or missed
other regular activities as a result of the illness).
2. “Upper respiratory illness” (URI) was defined as any 2 of
the following: sore throat, cough, runny nose, cold, or
fever.
3. “Rash” was defined as a rash or itchy skin.
4. “Eye ailments” were defined as either eye infection or
watery eye.
5. “Earache” was defined as earache, ear infection, or runny
ears.
Consistent with some other studies,8,10,11 URI and GI
illness were not restricted to persons with fever, since infections can produce these illnesses without fever (eg, E. coli
0157:H7 and norovirus infections). We were also concerned
about the accuracy of self-reported low-grade fever.
People who were ill within 3 days before their beach
visit were excluded for the outcome with which they had been
afflicted. We examined various definitions of GI illness

Epidemiology • Volume 19, Number 3, May 2008

including diarrhea (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour
period) alone and GI illness with complications (defined as
missing regular activities, using medications, or visiting a
health provider as a result of a GI symptom).

Definition of Swimming
“Swimmers” were those who reported immersing their
body to their waist or higher. In our previous analysis,
immersion to the waist showed a pattern of risk similar to
head immersion.1 Nonswimmers were defined as those who
reported no contact with water. Those entering the water not
up to their waist were classified as “waders.”

Statistical Analysis
Because QPCR CE were highly skewed, raw data were
log-transformed (base 10). The arithmetic mean of the logtransformed values was used to summarize water quality at a
given day, time, or location. We previously used a maximumlikelihood method to impute results for samples below the
limit of detection.1 However, QPCR CE from 2004 beaches
were not as well approximated by a log-normal distribution,
making imputation based on this exact distributional assumption questionable. Furthermore, we had concern that partial
inhibition may have been responsible for some nondetected
results, making the imputed detection limits incorrect. We
therefore excluded samples below the limit of detection from
the calculation of averages. However, this choice of method
for dealing with the limit of detection did not affect the results
(see Appendix B, available with the online version of this
article). We focused the analyses primarily on 2 summary
measures: the daily average of all samples and the average of
the 8:00 AM samples. The daily average represented average
water quality at a beach on a particular day. The 8:00 AM
average was used to determine if morning water quality was
predictive of illness among swimmers exposed later that
day—an important consideration for assessing the utility of a
faster method such as QPCR for water quality evaluation.
Analyses using depth-specific averages were also conducted and results are shown in Appendix B. Analysis of
variance models were used to explore the relationship
between log10 QPCR CE with beach, collection date, time,
and sample depth.
To account for correlated environmental measurements
as potential confounders of the swimming and health effects
relationships, we used principal-components analysis to produce summary components. The 5 principal components that
accounted for the majority of the variability (54%) were
included in health effects regression models. These 5 components were beach-goer density, temperature (water and air),
rainfall, wind direction and debris, and wind speed and wave
height. To avoid data loss when one or more of the environmental observations were missing (18 of 85 days), principal
components were imputed using best-subset regression.14

Rapid Water Quality Measures and Children’s Sensitivity to Illness

We used generalized linear-regression models to evaluate the association between water quality and health effects.
Logistic regression models were used to describe the strength
of the association between the QPCR CE measures and
incidence of illness among swimmers. Models using an
identity link and a binomial error structure (linear model)
were used to directly estimate the attributable risk15 (swimmer risk minus nonswimmer risk), which we refer to as
“swimming-associated illness.” Although the linear and logistic models produced similar results, the linear models
allowed direct estimation of the attributable risk, which is often
considered a more meaningful and direct statement of risk.5
Nonswimmers were included in models and were assigned
water quality exposures of zero. Indicators for “swimming” and
“beach” were included in all models. Log-linear models were
used to estimate the adjusted cumulative incidence ratio associated with swimming (without regard to water quality).15 Robust
estimates of variance were used to account for the nonindependence of observations within household.16 –18
Covariates strongly associated with swimming, water
quality or illness, or those considered by investigators to be
potential confounding factors were considered for inclusion
in regression models. These factors included age, sex, race,
contact with animals, contact with other persons with diarrhea, number of other visits to the beach, any other chronic
illnesses (GI, skin, asthma), digging in sand, and the first 5
principal components of the environmental/meteorological
factors (described above). An indicator was also created for a
festival that took place at Silver Beach, drawing 17,000 visitors
to an area adjacent to the beach. For URI, rash, and eye
outcomes, use of insect repellent and sun block were also
considered. For each analysis, the set of covariates was reduced
through a change-in-estimate procedure.19 A criterion of a 5%
change was used, although this was occasionally relaxed to
obtain a parsimonious model. The selection procedure generally
reduced the numbers of covariates to 7 or fewer.
To evaluate heterogeneity in the indicator/illness relationship across the beaches, we graphically examined the
relationship at each beach and conducted likelihood ratio
tests. These tests compared models with interaction terms
between beach and water quality (which allowed slopes to
differ across beaches) with restricted models constrained to a
single slope across the 4 beaches.
We conducted separate analysis for the age categories 0
to 10 years, 11 to 54 years, and 55 years and older. The age
groups were selected a priori based on sample size and
investigators’ judgment.

RESULTS
A total of 21,015 interviews from 10,093 household
groups were completed (Appendix B). Respondents at the 4
beaches differed by age, race, miles traveled to the beach and
proportion of swimmers (Appendix B). Respondents were

377



Epidemiology • Volume 19, Number 3, May 2008

Wade et al

85% white and 56% female, with a median age of 27 years.
Swimmers were younger than nonswimmers (median age 19
and 35 years, respectively) but were equally likely to report
rash, sore throat, vomiting, and eye irritations in the 3 days
prior to the beach visit, chronic respiratory illness (eg,
asthma), and chronic skin problems (Table 1). Slightly fewer
swimmers compared with nonswimmers reported chronic GI
conditions (2% vs. 3%), GI symptoms (other than vomiting)
in the 3 days prior to the beach visit (2% vs. 3%), chronic
allergies (18% vs. 21%), and consumption of red or raw meat
prior to or immediately after the beach visit (8% vs. 10%).
There were more female beach-goers than male in all 3
water-use groups, with the largest discrepancy among the
waders (63% vs. 37%) and the smallest among the swimmers
(52% vs. 48%). Most were white. The percentages of other
races were similar across water-use groups, except that the
percentage of Hispanic/Latino respondents was highest among

the swimmers. More swimmers than nonswimmers reported
using sunblock (61% vs. 40%), insect repellant (3% vs. 2%), and
having had contact with animals (79% vs. 75%).

Water Quality
Enterococcus QPCR CE differed by beach (Table 2)
and sample depth. Median QPCR CEs at shin depth were
higher than waist depth (93 and 65 QPCR CE/100 mL,
respectively). Collection time was not an important factor in
the variability of QPCR CE, although QPCR CE levels
measured at 3:00 PM were slightly higher than at 8:00 AM
(median QPCR CE/100 mL was 74, 78, and 80 at 8:00 AM,
11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM, respectively).
Twenty-five of 78 days (32%) exceeded the current
geometric mean guideline value of 33 colony forming units
(CFU)/100 mL Enterococcus measured by Method 1600.5

Health Effects
The incidence of new GI illness was 7.3% (1497 of
20,414) during the 10 to 12 day follow-up period. GI illness
incidence was highest among children younger than 5 years
(9.0%) and lowest among those aged 55 and older (4.9%).
The adjusted risk of GI illness was 1.44 times higher in swimmers than nonswimmers (95% CI ⫽ 1.27–1.64; Table 3). The
risks among children aged 10 and younger, and children and
adults aged 11 to 54, were similar to the pooled risk. Among
those aged 55 and older, swimmers reported 2.3 times as many
illnesses as nonswimmers of the same age (1.33–3.99; Table 4).
Children aged 5 and younger showed a similar pattern of risk as
those aged 10 years and younger, but with the exception of GI
illness (1.67 关CI ⫽ 1.03–2.69兴), small sample sizes prohibited
making conclusions about this age group.
Approximately 5.7% of respondents reported URI. Incidence was highest in children younger than 5 (10.6%) and
lowest in those aged 55 and older (2.5%). The crude incidence of URI was higher among swimmers than nonswimmers, but after adjustment there was little difference in risk

(1.06 关0.90 –1.24兴; Table3兴. Age was a strong confounder
because young respondents were both more likely both to
swim and report URI. Among children aged 10 years and
younger, URI risk was not elevated among swimmers (0.95
关0.66 –1.38兴; Table 4).
Approximately 2.7% of all respondents reported rash,
with the highest incidence in children younger than 5 years
(4.1%), and the lowest in those aged 55 and older (2.1%).
Swimmers reported more rash than nonswimmers (1.38 关CI ⫽
1.12–1.72兴; Table 3). Rashes occurred more frequently on the
upper and lower back (26%) of swimmers reporting rash than of
nonswimmers reporting rash (12%).
The incidence of eye irritations and infections was
2.9%; these were reported with equal frequency by swimmers
and nonswimmers (1.00 关0.81–1.24兴; Table 3).

Relationships Between Water Quality and
Health
The incidence of GI illness was consistently associated
with Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure (Table 5, Figs. 1 and
2). Among all subjects, a 1 log10 increase in the daily QPCR
CE average resulted in a 1.26 increase in the risk (odds) of GI
illness (95% CI ⫽ 1.06 –1.51). The relationship was stronger
among children, with a similar association for those aged 10
years and younger (1.69 关1.24 –2.30兴), 5 and younger (1.67
关1.08 –2.57兴), and 2 and younger (1.65 关0.81–3.36兴). The
association between the 8:00 AM Enterococcus QPCR CE
average and GI illness was nearly identical to that of the daily
average. As illustrated in Figure 1, 1000 swimmers exposed
to 100 Enterococcus QPCR CE would experience an average
of 34 more episodes of GI illness than nonswimmers. One
thousand swimming children aged 10 and younger would
experience an average of 49 more episodes than nonswimming children (Fig. 2). The associations between Enterococcus QPCR CE and GI illness were positive at each of the 4
beaches, and tests for heterogeneity indicated no difference in
these relationships across the 4 beaches among all subjects
(P ⫽ 0.84), or among children aged 10 and younger (P ⫽
0.65). Crude rates of GI illness and numbers exposed are
presented in Appendix C (available with the online version of
this article).

As time spent in the water increased beyond 1.5 hours,
the association between Enterococcus QPCR CE and GI
illness also increased. Among subjects exposed at least 2
hours, the risk of GI illness associated with Enterococcus
QPCR CE exposure increased (1.89 关1.07–3.35兴). Children
aged 5 to 10 years spent the most time in the water, an
average of 1.5 hours compared with 1.2 hours for those
younger than 5 years, 1.2 hours for those aged 11 to 20, and
less than an hour for those older than 20.
Other illnesses did not show strong or consistent associations with Enterococcus QPCR CE. For example, rash was
positively associated overall with Enterococcus QPCR CE
exposure among all subjects (aOR ⫽ 1.21 关CI ⫽ 0.92–1.58兴;
Table 5) and particularly among children (1.58 关0.90 –2.76兴;
Table 5). However, there was significant (P ⫽ 0.02) variation
in the association across the 4 beaches, with strong positive
associations at 2 of the beaches (at Silver Beach, aOR ⫽1.78
关CI ⫽ 1.08 –2.94兴 and at Washington Park Beach aOR ⫽ 1.60

an association (Huntington Beach 0.87 关0.27–2.85兴, and West
Beach 0.92 关0.57–1.48兴). The data were too sparse to reliably
assess heterogeneity on the association of beach-specific rash
with Enterococcus QPCR CE among children.

Swimmers exposed above the guideline value of 33
CFU/100 mL had higher risks than nonswimmers or swimmers exposed below this value (Table 6). As with QPCR CE,
the risks associated with Enterococcus CFU exposure were
more pronounced among children aged 10 and younger.
Enterococcus QPCR CE levels were a stronger predictor of GI illness than the CFU measure. Among all subjects,
a quartile increase in Enterococcus QPCR CE was associated
with a 1.44 (95% CI ⫽ 1.10 –1.90) increase in the odds of
illness for all subjects, whereas a quartile increase Enterococcus CFU was associated with only a 1.04 (0.90 –1.21)

A molecular method for rapid measurement of water
quality (Enterococcus QPCR CE) was consistently associated
with swimming-associated GI illness at 4 freshwater beaches.
Furthermore, the Enterococcus QPCR CE showed that children up to age 10 years were especially susceptible to GI
illness following swimming exposure. While a sensitivity
among children to illness following recreational water exposure has often been hypothesized,3,20 –23 this is the first study
to demonstrate this sensitivity as a function of microbial
water quality. At least one previous study has observed
higher rates of swimming-associated illness among children,
but the authors did not attribute the increased illnesses to
measures of water quality.24 Children may be more likely to
swallow water,25 transfer water to their mouth after exposure,
or, as we observed, spend a longer time in water, resulting in
a greater likelihood of contact with pathogens. Children are at
increased susceptibility to infection and illness caused by
several enteric pathogens.26,27 Such susceptibility may be due
to differences in immune system function, hygiene, and other
physiological and behavioral differences.27
We saw no evidence of increased susceptibility among
those aged 55 and older, but our ability to make valid
conclusions among this group was limited because they swam
infrequently and reported the lowest incidence of illness.
Swimmers in this age group did have a higher overall risk for
GI illness compared with nonswimmers, but the relative risk
may have been skewed by the low incidence of GI illness
among nonswimmers.
Some of the health endpoints were nonspecific, and
may have been affected by recall bias. Broad endpoints
accounted for the diverse range of symptoms potentially
associated with recreational water exposure but such broad
symptoms may obscure more specific effects of water quality
and swimming exposure. The association between Enterococcus QPCR CE and GI illness, however, was robust to
different definitions (diarrhea, GI illness with complications).
While swimmers may have been more likely to recall illness
than nonswimmers, it is unlikely such a recall bias would
occur among swimmers at varying levels of water quality. As
with our previous analysis, a more stringent definition of
swimming with head immersion did not substantially alter the
results (data not shown).
Numerous studies have considered associations between fecal indicator bacteria and symptoms of illness. The
majority of these studies have observed some association
with GI illness.22,28,29 Associations between fecal indicator

bacteria and nongastrointestinal (nonenteric) health conditions appear to be less consistent. Several studies9 –11,13 observed associations with respiratory illness, although not
all.8,12,30 –33 Similar inconsistencies have been observed for
skin, ear, and eye ailments.8 –10,12,30,31,34 Earaches and ear
infections are often associated with swimming and water
exposure, but associations with specific indicator organisms
have been inconsistent.8 –10,30,35
Enterococcus QPCR CE was more strongly associated
with illness than the currently recommended culture-based
method of measuring Enterococcus. The QPCR measure may
be a truer representation of fecal contamination, because it
measures all Enterococcus associated with feces, not just
viable cells. The molecular measurement of Enterococcus
DNA provides a stable, conservative means of quantifying
the level of fecal contamination, which is not subject to
die-off but may mirror the dilution and dispersion of fecal
material. Studies have demonstrated that pathogenic microorganisms (especially viruses and certain protists) are capable
of surviving the sewage treatment process. Levels of such
pathogens in treated effluent are often poorly correlated with
indicator bacteria measured by cultural methods.36 Whereas
fecal indicator bacteria are often nondetectable by culture
methods following sewage treatment, these same bacteria can
be detected by QPCR.37 A recent study found human adenoviruses at both Silver Beach and Washington Park Beach,
with municipal discharges as the likely source.38
The water quality at the beaches we studied was influenced by human sources of pollution. We do not know if the
relationships we observed between Enterococcus QPCR CE and
GI illness can be extended to marine beaches, or to recreational
waters affected by different sources of fecal contamination. Our
failure to observe consistent associations between nonenteric
illness and fecal indicator bacteria suggests a continuing need to
investigate the causes of excess nonenteric illnesses commonly
observed among swimmers.

1.0 Introduction
The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) recreational water criteria are
based on epidemiology studies of publicly owned treatment works (POTW) impacted waters. The
Critical Path Science Plan (CPSP), an effort by the EPA Office of Water (OW) and the EPA Office
of Research and Development (ORD) to assess recreational criteria, includes the investigation of
non-POTW impacted recreational waters to determine whether potential health risks are different
than those in recreational waters associated with POTWs. To assist with this investigation, EPA’s
Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD) contracted Great Lakes Environmental Center
(GLEC) to provide support for a study designed to monitor recreational waters impacted primarily
by urban/suburban runoff, which may carry a variety of pollutants including bacterial pathogens
and indicators of fecal contamination.
The primary objective of this study was to perform preliminary microbial monitoring (i.e.,
enumeration of enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and qPCR analysis) in support of
EPA’s search for a marine, non-POTW impacted beach affected by urban runoff. Urban runoff is
defined as storm water from rain, snowmelt or irrigation that flows over the land surface and is not
absorbed into the ground, instead flowing into streams or other surface waters or land
depressions, including the possible discharges of storm water or storm water runoff. The marine
waters selected for this study are not known by EPA to be impacted by: (1) discharges from
POTWs or combined sewer overflows (CSO) or (2) identified discharges of untreated human
waste from sanitary sewer systems. Therefore, the study was designed to collect data that will
allow for the determination of a relationship between human illness and fecal indicators that
originate from urban runoff in the absence of POTW and CSO discharges and untreated human
wastes.

2.0 Materials and Methods
The following section briefly outlines the methods by which samples were collected, processed
and analyzed for this monitoring effort. Extensive details concerning the collection protocols and
analytical methods utilized for this project are provided in the project’s Quality Assurance Project
Plan (QAPP) and Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively).
Occasionally there were instances when the procedures outlined in the QAPP and SAP were not
followed in entirety. Deviations from the QAPP and SAP are explained throughout the text of this
report and are summarized in Table 1.
2.1 Sample Locations
Through rigorous selection criteria based on Westat and Molina (2008), five marine beaches were
identified by the EPA for monitoring. Three of these beaches are located in South Carolina and
two are located in Florida. The South Carolina beaches include: Canes Patch Swash in Myrtle
Beach, Surfside Swash in Surfside and Withers Swash in Myrtle Beach. All of these beaches are
located in Horry County. The Florida beaches include: Silver Beach and Florida Shores. Both of
these beaches are located in Volusia County, north of Daytona Beach. Maps of the sampling
locations at each of the five beaches monitored during this study are provided in Figures 1
through 5. Digital pictures collected by GLEC at each beach and swash (where appropriate, see
Sampling Procedures below) are provided in Figures 6 through 9 (Canes Patch Swash), Figures
10 through 13 (Surfside Swash), Figures 14 through 17 (Withers Swash), Figure 18 (Florida
Shores) and Figure 19 (Silver Beach). Global positioning system (GPS) coordinates for each
sampling location are provided in Table 2.
2.2 Sampling Procedures
2.2.1 South Carolina
2.2.1.1 Baseline Sampling
At each of the three South Carolina beaches (Figures 1 through 3), the sampling area was
divided into five transects, each located perpendicular to the shoreline, with approximately 100 m
between each transect. The sampling area was selected by identifying the main ditch or storm
drain affecting the bathing zone. The middle transect was delineated at the main ditch or storm
drain. Samples were collected from this transect, and also from two transects to the right (north)
of the drain and from two transects to the left (south) of the drain. Therefore, a total of five
transects, each located 100 m apart, were sampled at each of the three South Carolina beaches.
Three water samples were collected from one location per transect at waist deep (approximately
1.0 m deep, 0.3 m below the surface) in 500 mL, pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottles and then
composited into a 2 L pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottle. This composite sample was used for
enterococci, Pseudomonas and qPCR sample analyses.
In addition to sample collection at each of the five beach transects, sampling was also conducted
in the ditch or storm drain stream used to delineate the beach transects (Figures 1 through 3).
The open ditch or stream was divided into three segments, each between 100 and 300 m apart.
Three water samples were collected per segment at a depth of 0.3 m, if water depth allowed for
such an interval, in 500 mL, pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottles. If water depth was inadequate to
collect a sample from a 0.3 m depth, samples were collected to avoid re-suspension of bottom
sediments to the greatest degree possible.
With two exceptions, baseline sampling at each of the three South Carolina beaches was
conducted by GLEC three times per week (Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays), over a period of
five weeks from December 16, 2008 through January 18, 2009. Because this sampling effort
coincided with the Christmas and New Year holidays, sampling originally scheduled to be

Page 7 of 64



DRAFT Final Report
SHPD WA 2-17 Monitoring of Marine Beaches Impacted by Urban Runoff

27 Feb 2009

completed on these days was moved to the Friday immediately after the holidays. GLEC
attempted to collect the samples within a two hour time frame during the morning hours (9:00 to
11:00 AM) at each beach and ditch/storm drain. This was accomplished for most sampling dates.
However, there were instances when GLEC was unable to complete sample collection within the
two hour window because of weather, beach conditions and/or access (see Table 1). Excluding
day one of the sampling effort, the longest window during which all samples were collected on a
given day in South Carolina was approximately 2.5 hours (December 23, 2008).
On Tuesdays only, one additional water sample was collected for dissolved organic carbon
(DOC) analysis from each of the five beach transects and three storm drain/ditch locations (for
each of the three South Carolina beaches). This sample was collected in an ashed (at ≥ 400°C
for two hours) 250 mL glass bottle, at the same location and depth as the composite samples
used for enterococci, Pseudomonas and qPCR analyses.
2.2.1.2 Rain Event Sampling
When there was an appreciable rain event (≥ 0.25 inches of rain) that was not captured during
the scheduled baseline sampling days, additional sampling was conducted within two to four
hours after accumulation of 0.25 inches or more of rainfall. In South Carolina, rain event samples
were collected on January 13 and January 29, 2009. For each of these two rain events, GLEC
followed the sampling procedures, and sampled at the same locations, as those outlined above.
2.2.1.3 Duplicate and Field Blank Sample Collection
For enterococci, Pseudomonas and qPCR samples collected during the baseline monitoring
period, field duplicates were collected at a rate of ≥ 10%. These samples were equally divided
across the three beaches and ditch/storm drain locations. Duplicate samples were collected in the
same manner in which investigative samples were collected. Field blank samples for enterococci,
Pseudomonas and qPCR collected during the baseline monitoring period were collected at a rate
of ≥ 5%. These samples were also equally divided across the three beaches and ditch/storm
drain locations. Field blanks for the bacterial analyses were collected by filling three of the 500
mL, pre-sterilized polycarbonate sample bottles with sterile phosphate buffer and compositing
them into a 2 L pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottle. The field blanks were then handled in the
same manner as investigative samples.
For DOC, field duplicate samples were collected in the same manner in which investigative
samples were collected: every Tuesday, in conjunction with collection of the investigative DOC
samples. One DOC field duplicate sample was collected at each beach or ditch/storm drain
location every Tuesday. Field blank samples for DOC were collected every Tuesday in
conjunction with the collection of the investigative DOC samples by filling a 250 mL ashed glass
bottle with 250 mL of laboratory de-ionized (DI) water. The field blank samples were then
processed in the same manner as the investigative DOC samples.
Rain event field blank and field duplicate samples were collected at a rate of one blank and one
duplicate for each rain event at each beach or dith/storm drain location.
2.2.2 Florida
2.2.2.1 Baseline Sampling
At each of the two Florida beaches (Figures 4 and 5), the sampling area was divided into three
transects, with approximately 200 m between each transect. Each transect was situated
perpendicular to the shoreline. Three water samples were collected from one location per
transect at waist deep (approximately 1.0 m deep, 0.3 m below the surface) in 500 mL, presterilized polycarbonate bottles. The three samples were then composited into a single 2 L presterilized polycarbonate bottle.

27 Feb 2009

With three exceptions, baseline sampling at each of the two Florida beaches was conducted
three times per week (Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays), over a period of five weeks from
December 16, 2008 through January 18, 2009. Because this sampling effort coincided with the
Christmas and New Year holidays, sampling originally scheduled to be completed on these days
was moved to the Friday immediately after the holidays. In addition, samples were not collected
on December 28 (Sunday) because of a flight cancellation for the GLEC field crew leader (Table
1). Therefore, this sample was collected the next day (December 29, 2008). With few exceptions,
GLEC collected the samples within a two hour time frame during the morning hours (9:00 to
11:00 AM) at each beach.
On Tuesdays only, one additional water sample was collected for DOC analysis from the three
transects at each of the two beach locations. This sample was collected in an ashed (at ≥ 400°C
for two hours) 250 mL glass bottle at each transect, at the same location and depth as the
composite samples used for enterococci, Pseudomonas and qPCR analyses.
2.2.2.2 Rain Event Sampling
When there was an appreciable rain event (≥ 0.25 inches of rain) that was not captured during
the baseline sampling period, additional sampling was conducted within two to four hours after
accumulation of 0.25 inches of rainfall. In Florida, samples were collected during one rain event
on January 30, 2009. During this rain event GLEC followed the sampling procedures, and
sampled at the same locations, as those outlined above.
2.2.2.3 Duplicate and Field Blank Sample Collection
For enterococci, Pseudomonas and qPCR samples collected during the baseline sampling
period, field duplicates were collected at a rate of ≥ 10%. These samples were equally divided
across the two beaches. Duplicate samples were collected in the same manner in which
investigative samples were collected. Field blank samples for enterococci, Pseudomonas and
qPCR collected during the baseline monitoring period were collected at a rate of ≥ 5%. These
samples were also equally divided across the two beaches. Field blanks for the bacterial
analyses were collected by filling three of the 500 mL, pre-sterilized polycarbonate sample bottles
with sterile phosphate buffer and compositing them into a 2 L pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottle.
The field blanks were then handled in the same manner as investigative samples.
For DOC, field duplicate samples were collected in the same manner in which investigative
samples were collected: every Tuesday, in conjunction with collection of the investigative DOC
samples. One DOC field duplicate sample was collected at each beach every Tuesday. Field
blank samples for DOC were collected every Tuesday in conjunction with the collection of the
investigative DOC samples by filling a 250 mL ashed glass bottle with 250 mL of DI water. The
field blank samples were then processed in the same manner as the investigative DOC samples.
Rain event field blank and field duplicate samples were collected at a rate of one blank and one
duplicate for the rain event at each beach location.
2.3 Sample Collection
Samples were collected at each location using the methods outlined in Section 9060 of APHA et
al. (1998). A brief summary of this method is outlined below. Extensive details concerning the
methods by which samples were collected are also provided in the QAPP and SAP (Appendix A
and B, respectively).
Using aseptic techniques (i.e. latex or nitrile gloves and, where necessary, shoulder length
polyethylene gloves, and waders), three water samples were collected from one location per
transect at waist deep (approximately 1.0 m) in 500 mL, pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottles. To
collect these samples, the un-capped, face down 500 mL sample bottle was lowered to a depth of

Page 9 of 64



DRAFT Final Report
SHPD WA 2-17 Monitoring of Marine Beaches Impacted by Urban Runoff

27 Feb 2009

approximately 0.3 m below the water surface, taking care to avoid surface scum, vegetation and
substrates. The mouth of the container was pointed away from the sampler. The bottle was then
righted, with the opening facing away from the body, and raised through the water column,
allowing the bottle to fill completely. This process was repeated three times (once per bottle).
Bottles were capped immediately after sample collection.
The three water samples were then composited into a 2 L, pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottle,
and a reducing agent (three tablets of sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3)) was added to prevent the
continuation of bactericidal action and to reduce any strong oxidants that may have been present
in the sample and interfered with the analysis. Samples were placed in a cooler immediately after
collection and maintained at < 4°C on wet ice.
A 500 mL portion of each of the composited water samples was removed from the 2 L
polycarbonate bottle and transferred to a 500 mL pre-sterilized polycarbonate bottle and stored
on wet ice for later filtration (within 6 hours) for qPCR analysis. There were three individual filters
processed for each qPCR sample collected in South Carolina and five individual filters were
processed for each qPCR sample collected in Florida. Each of these filters was maintained in a
cooler on dry ice. The remaining portion of the composite sample (1,000 mL) was delivered to the
local analytical laboratory on wet ice where it was filtered for enumeration of culturable
enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
2.4 Collection of Ancillary Data
Site-specific ancillary data were collected during sampling visits at each of the five beaches and
each of the nine ditch/storm drain locations. The parameters that were measured in the field are
shown in Table 3, along with descriptions of their measurement. The ancillary data collected for
this effort are provided on the accompanying project DVD and are not discussed directly in this
report.
2.5 Sample Filtration and Processing
2.5.1 qPCR Samples
With few exceptions, filtration of the composite water samples for qPCR analysis was performed
by GLEC within six hours of sample collection. However, there were instances (particularly in
South Carolina) when, because of the exceptional level of effort required for sample filtration, the
field crew exceeded the six hour filtration threshold. Instances when the six hour threshold was
exceeded are highlighted in the final data files (see project DVD) and Table 1.
In addition to occasionally exceeding the recommended holding time, no qPCR filters were
collected in South Carolina on December 16, 2008 because of the extraordinary time required to
collect and filter the samples (filtration of the first of six batches of samples on this date was not
completed until approximately six hours after the recommended holding time). Because of the
holding time exceedance for qPCR filters on December 16, 2008 (the first day of sample
collection), GLEC reduced the filtration effort by only collecting two filters per sample on
December 18 and 21, 2008. Per EPA’s guidance, three qPCR filters were collected per sample in
South Carolina beginning on December 23, 2008 (and continuing for the remainder of the study).
However, only one qPCR filter was collected per sample during the rain event on January 29,
2009 in South Carolina because of the concern of exceeding the holding time for all samples if
three filters were collected per sample. Exceptions to the QAPP in regards to the number of
qPCR filters collected in South Carolina are summarized in Table 1.
Specific details regarding the procedure by which qPCR samples were filtered and preserved are
provided in the project’s SAP (Appendix B). Briefly, five 100 mL aliquots of the composited water
sample were filtered using separate 47 mm, 0.4 μm polycarbonate filters. These filters were then
placed in microcentrifuge tubes and stored on dry ice (approximately -80°C) until shipment. In

Florida two of the five qPCR filters for each sample were shipped on dry ice to NRMRL/WSWRD,
Cincinnati, OH, and the other three filters were shipped to NERL/ERD, Athens, GA (see full
addresses below). In South Carolina one of the three qPCR filters for each sample was shipped
on dry ice to NRMRL/WSWRD, Cincinnati, OH, and the other two filters were shipped to
NERL/ERD, Athens, GA. The filters were shipped to each laboratory after the first two weeks of
sample collection, and then after the last three weeks of sample collection. Additional samples
(rain events) were shipped separately to the EPA laboratories. All qPCR sample filters were
shipped packed in dry ice (approximately -80°C) via overnight courier.

In addition to investigative samples, negative controls for the rinse procedure (i.e. equipment
blanks) using PCR grade water were collected twice in both South Carolina and Florida for each
laboratory (i.e. two blanks per state per EPA lab for a total of eight equipment blanks). In addition,
a suspension with a known concentration of Enterococcus faecalis was filtered to provide a
positive control. The positive control samples were provided to each EPA laboratory receiving
qPCR samples at a rate of two positive controls per state (total of eight samples).
The analytical results for qPCR are available from EPA and are not discussed directly in this
report.
2.5.2 Dissolved Organic Carbon Samples
The DOC samples were kept on wet ice or in a refrigerator and stored at approximately 4 °C until
sample filtration. With several exceptions, each DOC sample was filtered within 24 hours of
sample collection (see project DVD and Table 1). The method by which samples were filtered is
provided in the project’s SAP (Appendix B). Once filtered, the DOC samples were shipped to
NERL/ERD, Athens, GA (see address, above) after the first two weeks of sample collection, and
after the last three weeks of sample collection. The samples were shipped packed in wet ice via
overnight courier.
The analytical results for DOC are available from EPA and are not discussed directly in this
report.
2.5.3 Bacteriological Samples
The remaining portion of the 2 L composite samples (after the removal of the 500 mL sample for
qPCR processing) was delivered to local analytical laboratories on wet ice (approximately 4°C)

where they were filtered for enumeration of culturable enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
With few exceptions, they were processed within six hours of sample collection (see project DVD
and Table 1). In Florida, laboratory analyses were completed by the Volusia County
Environmental Health Laboratory. In South Carolina, laboratory analyses were completed by
Environmental Systems Testing Services. Contact information for these laboratories is provided

2.5.3.1 Enterococci Samples
Enterococci enumeration followed EPA Method 1600 on mEI agar plates (EPA 2006; Haugland et
al. 2005). For the culturable enterococci analyses, volumes of 100 mL, 50 mL and 10 mL of the
water sample will be filtered, if necessary. These dilutions were adjusted for each beach
depending on historical or previous samples. Colony counts from the 100 mL sample volumes
were reported unless they exceeded 150, in which case counts from one or the other of the
smaller volumes were used after multiplying by an appropriate correction factor to express the
enterococci counts in CFU/100 mL.
As described in the method, verification tests on the identities of five colonies per sample were
performed for all water samples collected during the first day of the study at each beach site. This
verification step was completed at GLEC by a GLEC microbiologist. GLEC coordinated the
shipment of processed (counted and marked) filters with the laboratories to avoid weekend
delivery (for temperature maintenance concerns) to GLEC.
Each new batch of mEI agar was tested for positive performance using pure cultures of
Enterococcus faecalis, and for negative performance using a pure culture of a non-target
organism, e.g. E. coli. The sterility of the filters and phosphate-buffered water used for rinsing the
filtration apparatus was also tested with each batch of samples arriving together at the laboratory.
2.5.3.2 Pseudomonas Samples
For enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the laboratories followed ASTM Method D5246-92
(2004). A volume of 100 to 200 mL was filtered, with appropriate dilutions when bacterial
concentrations were high. Colony counts were reported on a per 100 mL basis.
As described in the method, verification tests on the identities of ten colonies per sample were
performed in skim milk agar, and were performed for all water samples collected on one day
during the first week of the study at each beach site. This verification was completed at GLEC by
a GLEC microbiologist. GLEC coordinated the shipment of processed (counted and marked)
filters with the laboratories to avoid weekend delivery (for temperature maintenance concerns) to
GLEC.

Each new batch of agar was tested for positive performance using pure cultures of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and for negative performance using a pure culture of non-target organisms, e.g. E.
feacalis. The laboratories reported results from plates producing between 20 and 80 colonies,

3.0 Results and Discussion
3.1 Verifications Tests and Laboratory Audits
The Volusia County Environmental Health Laboratory and Environmental Systems Testing
Services provided final microbiological plates to GLEC for verification of the procedures for
isolating enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Plates from early sample events were sent
on ice via FedEx Priority Overnight service from the laboratories to GLEC. Colonies which were
counted for data were identified on the plates and subjected to verification procedures as outlined
in Method 1600 for enterococcus and Method D5246-92 for Pseudomonas (see QAPP in
Appendix A). Eight plates were selected at random from each laboratory for evaluation of
enterococcus. In addition, eight plates were selected at random for evaluation of Pseudomonas
from the South Carolina laboratory, but due to lack of growth, only a single plate was available
from the Florida laboratory.
Verification results for enterococcus from both the Florida and South Carolina laboratories
indicated that all selected counted colonies were correctly verified as enterococcus using the
multi-stage process outlined in the Method. Isolation of enterococci in water using mEI media is
quite good, with fairly low false positive and false negative results in a variety of environmental
water samples.
Verification results for Pseudomonas from the Florida laboratory for the single plate containing
colony growth were verified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Seven of the eight plates selected at
random for the South Carolina laboratory were also positively identified for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. One plate contained colonies thought to be Pseudomonas, but did not produce the
correct clearing of the medium or fluorescent green-yellow pigment as described in the Method
verification procedure. These colonies had a more “yellow to white” color than the “pink to brown”
color specified in the Method. The laboratory was provided with this information to correct future
plate counts.
The Florida and South Carolina laboratories were also subjected to audits in order to ensure that
the data generated by each laboratory were of the quality necessary to meet the goals of the
study.
An initial site visit for each laboratory was conducted by GLEC research staff in order to assess
general laboratory operations and to confirm that each microbiology laboratory was clean and
prepared, and all necessary equipment was present and calibrated. Observations were made of
sample receipt and sample tracking using customary chain-of-custody reports. In addition to the
onsite visit, GLEC participated in several pre-implementation phone calls with each laboratory to
provide technical support for the laboratory for the selected methods. During the project, GLEC
was also in contact with the laboratories to answer questions, and to provide additional technical
support as required.
GLEC required that each laboratory send Enterococci and Pseudomonas plates from the final
project sample event for an assessment and quality control (QC) check of colony counts. Plates
were counted by the laboratories, sealed and sent on ice via FedEx Priority Overnight. Upon
receipt, GLEC staff independently assessed colony numbers for 10 and 6 randomly selected
plates from the South Carolina and Florida laboratories, respectively. Colony numbers were
assessed for both enterococcus and Pseudomonas. Colony counts were within ± 5% for the
Florida laboratory for both bacteria assessed. The South Carolina laboratory was ± 10% for 8 of
10 samples of enterococcus, and 7 of 10 for Pseudomonas. Colony numbers for both bacterial
types were much higher in South Carolina than Florida (see results below).
At the conclusion of the project, GLEC solicited additional laboratory documentation for quality
assurance (QA)/QC data, equipment calibration logs, laboratory supplies and consumables to
verify this documentation was in place and up-to-date. No deficiencies for either lab were noted.

DVD.
3.2 Manipulation of Laboratory Data
The enterococci and Pseudomonas concentration data reported by the Florida and South
Carolina microbiological laboratories are provided in Appendix C. After reviewing these data,
GLEC determined that there were inconsistencies in the method by which the South Carolina
laboratory determined plate counts for the samples. On occasion the laboratory ceased counting
colonies of Pseudomonas or enterococci bacteria once 60 colonies were identified in a particular
dilution. In these instances the laboratory reported values as >60 CFU/100 mL (for a 100 mL
sample), or another value appropriate for the dilution factor (>240, >600 or >6,000 CFU/100 mL
for 25, 10 and 1 mL dilutions, respectively). However, there were also instances when the
laboratory counted more than 60 colonies on a plate for any of a number of dilutions. For
example, the laboratory may have counted 120 colonies in 25 mL of sample. In this case the
South Carolina laboratory may have reported a value of 480 CFU/100 mL.
In addition to the inconsistencies reported above, the South Carolina microbiological laboratory
also (on occasion) reported values for all dilutions, regardless of which data were most
appropriate (based on the method) for reporting purposes.
To address these inconsistencies, GLEC altered some of the South Carolina laboratory data
based on the following rules:
1) If a direct count was reported by the laboratory (i.e., no > sign associated with the data), this
value was used without alteration by GLEC.
2) If two direct counts were reported by the laboratory for two separate dilutions of the same
sample, GLEC used the count between 20 and 60 for a particular dilution to determine the
reported value. If colony counts for a particular dilution were not between 20 and 60, the dilution
volume with a count closest to the 20 to 60 range was used to determine the value reported by
GLEC.
3) When >60 colonies were reported for all dilutions for the same sample, the smallest dilution
was used to determine the reported value.
The GLEC altered data (with original data as reported by the South Carolina laboratory) are
provided in Appendix D; these altered data were used in this report. Please note that no data
from the Florida microbiological laboratory were altered by GLEC; these data are provided in
Appendix C.
Because the inclusion of > or < symbols during the calculation of data means, figure generation,
etc. is problematic, GLEC chose to remove the > symbol from data, where appropriate. For
example, data with a reported value of >60 were assigned a value of 60 to allow for the
generation of data means, figures, etc. in this report. In addition, values less than the reporting
limit (e.x. <2) were assigned a value of 0 for the generation of data means, figures, etc. in this
report.

Carolina and Tables 7 and 8 present Pseudomonas concentration data for beaches sampled in

3.3.1 Baseline Data
In South Carolina, concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the baseline
monitoring period ranged between <2 and >600 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Canes
Patch Swash (Table 4), between <2 and 144 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Withers
Swash (Table 5) and between <2 and 176 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Surfside Swash
(Table 6). Mean concentrations at each of the three sampling areas, averaged across the entire
baseline sampling period, ranged from 17 to 35 CFU/100 mL (Table 7).
Across the entire baseline sampling period, Pseudomonas concentrations at the South Carolina
beach transects ranged between 1.7 (Surfside Swash BT-3) and 14 CFU/100 mL (Canes Patch
Swash BT-2) (Table 7). When averaging across beach transects, concentrations of
Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the baseline period were most elevated at Canes Patch
Swash (11 CFU/100 mL) and least at Surfside Swash (3.7 CFU/100mL).
Across the entire baseline sampling period, Pseudomonas concentrations at the South Carolina
ditch/storm drain sampling locations ranged between 18 (Canes Patch Swash DT-3) and 123
CFU/100 mL (Canes Patch Swash DT-2) (Table 7). When averaging across ditch/storm drain
sampling locations in South Carolina, concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria collected during
the baseline period were most elevated at Canes Patch Swash (74 CFU/100 mL) and least at
Withers Swash (43 CFU/100mL). The relatively high Pseudomonas bacteria counts associated
with the ditch/storm drain at Canes Patch Swash corresponded to elevated concentrations of
Pseudomonas bacteria observed at the beach transects (Table 4).
Overall, mean concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria in South Carolina were more elevated
and variable at the ditch/storm drain sampling locations than at associated beach locations
(Figures 20 through 23 and Table 7).
In Florida, Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the baseline monitoring period were only
measured above the method detection limit in two samples collected at Silver Beach (Table 8)
and two samples collected at Florida Shores (Table 9). These four samples had reported
Pseudomonas concentrations of 1 CFU/100 mL. Three of these four samples were collected on
December 18, 2008.
3.3.2 Rain Event Data
In South Carolina, concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the rain events
(January 13 and 29, 2009) ranged between <2 and 168 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with
Canes Patch Swash (Table 4), between 4 and >120 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Withers
Swash (Table 5) and between <2 and >120 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Surfside Swash
(Table 6). Mean concentrations at each of the three sampling areas, averaged across the two rain
events, ranged from 41 to 60 CFU/100 mL (Table 7). With the exception of the ditch/storm drain
sampling locations at Canes Patch Swash, concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria in South
Carolina were always more elevated during rain events than during the baseline monitoring
period (Tables 4 through 7).
When considering the two rain events in South Carolina, Pseudomonas concentrations at the
beach transects ranged between 5.0 (Surfside Swash BT-2 and BT-3) and 66 CFU/100 mL
(Withers Swash BT-3) (Table 7). When averaging across beach transects, concentrations of
Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the rain events were most elevated at Canes Patch
Swash (52 CFU/100 mL) and least at Surfside Swash (17 CFU/100mL). This pattern was also
observed for Pseudomonas concentrations observed at the beach transects during the baseline
monitoring period.
Across the two rain events, Pseudomonas concentrations at the South Carolina ditch/storm drain
sampling locations ranged between <2 (Canes Patch Swash DT-2) and 168 CFU/100 mL (Canes

Patch Swash DT-1) (Table 7). When averaging across ditch/storm drain sampling locations in
South Carolina, concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the rain events were
most elevated at Withers Swash (87 CFU/100 mL) and least at Canes Patch Swash (72
CFU/100mL). Contrary to the pattern observed during the baseline monitoring period, the
relatively high Pseudomonas bacteria counts associated with the ditch/storm drains during the
rain events did not necessarily translate to elevated concentrations of Pseudomonas bacteria
observed at the beach transects (Table 7).
In Florida, Pseudomonas bacteria collected during the rain event (January 30, 2009) were never
measured above the method detection limit.
3.4 Enterococci Data
Tables 4 through 6 present enterococci concentration data for beaches sampled in South
Carolina and Tables 7 and 8 present enterococci concentration data for beaches sampled in
Florida.
3.4.1 Baseline Data
In South Carolina, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the baseline monitoring
period ranged between <2 and 876 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Canes Patch Swash
(Table 4), between <4 and 2,760 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Withers Swash (Table 5)
and between <4 and 2,470 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Surfside Swash (Table 6). Mean
concentrations at each of the three sampling areas, averaged across the entire baseline sampling
period, ranged from 86 to 231 CFU/100 mL (Table 7).
Across the entire baseline sampling period, enterococci concentrations at the South Carolina
beach transects ranged between 23 (Surfside Swash BT-1) and 177 CFU/100 mL (Canes Patch
Swash BT-5) (Table 7). When averaging across beach transects, concentrations of enterococci
bacteria collected during the baseline period were most elevated at Canes Patch Swash (163
CFU/100 mL) and least at Surfside Swash (25 CFU/100mL).
Across the entire baseline sampling period, enterococci concentrations at the South Carolina
ditch/storm drain sampling locations ranged between 19 (Canes Patch Swash DT-3) and 992
CFU/100 mL (Withers Swash DT-2) (Table 7). When averaging across ditch/storm drain sampling
locations in South Carolina, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the baseline
period were most elevated at Withers Swash (654 CFU/100 mL) and least at Canes Patch Swash
(189 CFU/100mL). Elevated enterococci bacteria counts associated with the ditch/storm drains
did not necessarily translate to elevated concentrations of enterococci bacteria observed at the
associated beach transects (Table 7).
Overall, mean concentrations of enterococci bacteria in South Carolina were more elevated and
variable at the ditch/storm drain sampling locations than at associated beach transects (Figures
24 through 26 and Table 7).
In Florida, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the baseline monitoring period
ranged between <1 and 47 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Silver Beach (Table 8) and
between <1 and 108 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Florida Shores (Table 9). Mean
concentrations at each of the two sampling areas, averaged across the entire baseline sampling
period, were 12 and 20 CFU/100 mL for Silver Beach and Florida Shores, respectively (Table 7).
Concentrations of enterococci measured during the baseline monitoring period were also more
variable at Florida Shores than at Silver Beach (Figure 27). Across the entire baseline sampling
period, enterococci concentrations at the Florida beach transects ranged between 10 (Silver
Beach transect 2) and 26 CFU/100 mL (Florida Shores transect 3) (Table 7).

27 Feb 2009

Enterococci concentrations measured during the baseline monitoring period in South Carolina
were more elevated than those measured during the same time period in Florida (Tables 4
through 6, Tables 8 and 9 and Figure 28). Mean concentrations of enterococci bacteria, averaged
across the entire baseline sampling period for each of the five beach locations, never exceeded
20 CFU/100 mL in Florida and were never less than 86 CFU/100mL in South Carolina (Table 7).
3.4.2 Rain Event Data
In South Carolina, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the rain events
(January 13 and 29, 2009) ranged between <4 and 1,120 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with
Canes Patch Swash (Table 4), between <4 and 2,740 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with
Withers Swash (Table 5) and between <4 and >2,000 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with
Surfside Swash (Table 6). Mean concentrations at each of the three sampling areas, averaged
across the two rain events, ranged from 279 to 816 CFU/100 mL (Table 7).
When considering the two rain events in South Carolina, enterococci concentrations at the beach
transects ranged between 112 (Canes Patch Swash BT-4) and 446 CFU/100 mL (Withers Swash
BT-4) (Table 7). When averaging across beach transects, concentrations of enterococci bacteria
collected during the rain events were most elevated at Withers Swash (415 CFU/100 mL) and
least at Canes Patch Swash (129 CFU/100mL). This pattern was different than that observed for
enterococci concentrations at the beach transects during the baseline monitoring period; Canes
Patch Swash had the most elevated enterococci concentration during the rain events (when
averaged across beach transects).
Across the two rain events, enterococci concentrations at the South Carolina ditch/storm drain
sampling locations ranged between 64 (Canes Patch Swash DT-3) and 1,750 CFU/100 mL
(Withers Swash DT-2) (Table 7). When averaging across ditch/storm drain sampling locations in
South Carolina, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the rain events were most
elevated at Withers Swash (1,485 CFU/100 mL) and least at Canes Patch Swash (530
CFU/100mL). The relatively high enterococci bacteria counts associated with the ditch/storm
drains during the rain events translated directly to elevated concentrations of enterococci bacteria
observed at the beach transects (Table 7).
With the exception of the beach sampling locations at Canes Patch Swash, mean concentrations
of enterococci bacteria in South Carolina were always more elevated during rain events than
during the baseline monitoring period (Tables 4 through 7).
In Florida, concentrations of enterococci bacteria collected during the one rain event (January 30,
2009) ranged between 3 and 13 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Silver Beach (Table 8) and
between 21 and 24 CFU/100 mL at sites associated with Florida Shores (Table 9). Mean
concentrations at each of the two sampling areas, averaged across the entire baseline sampling
period, were 8.3 and 22 CFU/100 mL for Silver Beach and Florida Shores, respectively (Table 7).
During the one rain event, enterococci concentrations at the Florida beach transects ranged
between 3 (Silver Beach transect 2) and 24 CFU/100 mL (Florida Shores transect 1) (Table 7).
Enterococci concentrations measured during the rain events in South Carolina were more
elevated than those measured during the rain event in Florida (Tables 4 through 6, Tables 8 and
9). Mean concentrations of enterococci bacteria, averaged across the rain events and sites
associated with the five beaches, never exceeded 22 CFU/100 mL in Florida and were never less
than 279 CFU/100mL in South Carolina (Table 7).
3.5 Field Blanks and Duplicates
In general there were relatively few (if any) Pseudomonas or enterococci bacteria detected in field
blank samples collected as part of the quality assurance/quality control QA/QC program (Table
10). Concentrations of enterococci bacteria were always less than the method detection limit with

Page 18 of 64

three exceptions: two field blanks collected on January 29 (Canes Patch Swash BT1 and Withers
Swash BT5) had concentrations of 36 and 4 CFU/100 mL, respectively. These samples were
associated with the second rain event in South Carolina. One additional enterococci field blank
sample collected on January 15, 2009 at Wither Swash (BT3) also had a measurable
concentration of 24 CFU/100 mL. When reviewing the Pseudomonas field blank data, there was
only one sample that was measured above the method detection limit. This sample was collected
on December 28, 2008 at Withers Swash (BT3) (measured concentration of 4 CFU/100 mL).
Duplicate samples, collected as part of the QA/QC program, showed considerable agreement
with investigative samples (Table 11). With few exceptions, the relative percent difference
between the investigative sample and the field duplicate were within acceptable limits as defined
in the project’s QAPP (Appendix A).
3.6 Sources of Urban Runoff
As depicted in Figures 29 and 30, there are a considerable number of storm water outfalls in
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the vicinity of the sampling sites that were monitored by GLEC.
(Please note that there were no data available for outfalls in the vicinity of Surfside Swash in
Surfside, South Carolina. However, we can reasonably assume that a similar configuration exists
in this area). Each of these outfalls has the capacity to carry storm water runoff from rain,
snowmelt or irrigation and may potentially affect the data that were collected for this project
(particularly those data collected during the two rain events).
Volusia County, Florida, which includes the city of Daytona Beach, has no direct storm sewer
outfalls to the ocean; storm drains empty directly into the Halifax River (Towle 2009). The outlet of
this river is located approximately eight miles south of the closer of the two Florida beaches
monitored during this study (Florida Shores). However, there are sites at the beach by which
stormwater could directly enter the ocean; these sites are primarily associated with
condominium/apartment complexes, parking lots or beach approaches (streets that allow cars
direct access to the beach) rather than from an outfall (Winters 2009).
