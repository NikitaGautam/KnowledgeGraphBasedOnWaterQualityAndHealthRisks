Abstract
Microbial source tracking (MST) describes a suite of methods and an investigative strategy for determination of fecal pollution sources in environmental
waters that rely on the association of certain fecal microorganisms with a particular host. MST is used to assess recreational water quality and associated
human health risk, and total maximum daily load allocations. Many methods
rely on signature molecules (markers) such as DNA sequences of host-associated microorganisms. Human sewage pollution is among the greatest concerns
for human health due to (1) the known risk of exposure to human waste and
(2) the public and regulatory will to reduce sewage pollution; however, methods to identify animal sources are receiving increasing attention as our understanding of zoonotic disease potential improves. Here, we review the
performance of MST methods in initial reports and field studies, with particular emphasis on quantitative PCR (qPCR). Relationships among human-associated MST markers, fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens, and human health
outcomes are presented along with recommendations for future research. An
integrated understanding of the advantages and drawbacks of the many MST
methods targeting human sources advanced over the past several decades will
benefit managers, regulators, researchers, and other users of this rapidly growing area of environmental microbiology.

Introduction
Establishing the need for microbial source
tracking (MST)

Limitations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)
Sewage contamination of water bodies poses a definite risk
to human health via waterborne pathogens (Cabelli et al.,
1982; Cheung et al., 1990; Wade et al., 2003). Monitoring
for all waterborne pathogens in environmental waters is
currently unrealistic due to the great diversity of pathogens that are known to be present in sewage (including
viruses, bacteria, and protozoa), and the disparate methods required for concentrating and analyzing them, yet
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

monitoring for only one or a handful of pathogens may
give a false impression of safety if pathogens other than
those tested are present. Furthermore, many pathogens are
difficult and costly to culture, are difficult to identify, and
have patchy distributions or low concentrations in environmental waters (Field & Samadpour, 2007; Stoeckel &
Harwood, 2007). For over a century, the approach to this
problem has been to monitor for FIB, which have been
selected due to low pathogenic potential, high levels in
sewage and feces, and relationship to pathogen presence.
The major FIB used worldwide include fecal coliforms,
Escherichia coli, and enterococci (see (Leclerc et al., 2001;
Tallon et al., 2005; Griffith et al., 2009) for reviews).
The use of FIB as surrogates for human health risk is
replete with assumptions, one of the most important of

MST and applications
MST emerged at the end of the 20th century (Wiggins,
1996; Parveen et al., 1997; Hagedorn et al., 1999; Bernhard & Field, 2000a; Harwood et al., 2000) as an attempt
to determine the dominant sources of fecal contamination
in environmental waters (Scott et al., 2005; Field & Samadpour, 2007; Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007; Harwood
et al., 2009). The impetus for emergence of this research
area derives from (1) the effort to determine the extent
to which fecal source (e.g. human, dog, cattle) influences
human health risk from contact with water and (2) the
desire to attribute FIB loading in water bodies to the
correct fecal sources. The basic premise of MST is that
certain fecal microorganisms are strongly associated with
particular hosts and that identified attributes of these
host-associated microorganisms can be used as markers
for fecal contamination from the host. The utility of two
basic strategies have been tested (1) library-dependent
analyses that required the collection and typing of many
FIB isolates for some identifying attribute, including antibiotic resistance (Parveen et al., 1997; Harwood et al.,
2000), carbon source utilization (Hagedorn et al., 1999),
or genetic type (Parveen et al., 1999; Moore et al., 2005)
and (2) library-independent analyses that target a particular feature of a specific bacterial species or type, for
example, a variable region of the 16S rRNA gene of
Bacteroidales (Bernhard & Field, 2000b).
The number and range of potential host sources
included in MST studies must be deliberately chosen to
suit the water body and particular questions associated
with it (Harwood & Stoeckel, 2011). In the case of
library-dependent methods, known fecal sources sampled
determine the host range of library-dependent methods,
that is, one would isolate and type FIB from the feces of
the animals judged most likely to contaminate the area.
Library-independent methods must rely upon a separate
analytical method for each host source to be investigated.
The most broadly useful methods employ host-specific
markers that can be applied in diverse geographic settings. These methods usually omit a culture step, and so
they yield same-day results that can allow timely management decisions for applications such as beach closures
(Wade et al., 2006; Field & Samadpour, 2007).
MST applications are diverse, ranging from assessment
of beach water quality (Brownell et al., 2007; Abdelzaher
et al., 2010; Korajkic et al., 2011) to source allocations
for total maximum daily load plans (Simpson et al., 2002;
Arnone & Walling, 2007), the legal arena (Weidhaas
et al., 2010; Teaf et al., 2011), and food safety (Santo
Domingo & Sadowsky, 2007; Graves, 2011). Likewise, the
host species implicated as potential pollution sources in

FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/38/1/1/509509 by guest on 25 February 2022

which is that FIB consistently covary with pathogen
presence; however, FIB concentrations have not been
well correlated with pathogens in many studies (Lund,
1996; Bonadonna et al., 2002; Lemarchand & Lebaron,
2003; Anderson et al., 2005; Harwood et al., 2005). This
lack of correlation is generally attributed to the widely
differing physiology and phylogeny of FIB and pathogens (comprised of bacteria, enteric viruses, and protozoans such as Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.).
Furthermore, many epidemiology studies have failed to
find a correlation between human health outcomes and
FIB levels, particularly when the pollution is not from a
known point source such as a wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP) (Prieto et al., 2001; Dwight et al., 2004;
Colford et al., 2007). The disconnect can be attributed,
at least in part, to the fact that E. coli, enterococci, and
other FIB are shed in the feces of many different animals (Harwood et al., 1999; Souza et al., 1999; Leclerc
et al., 2001). Due to sometimes limited cohort sizes and
FIB levels, some epidemiological studies simply lack the
sensitivity to determine significant relationships between
health risk and FIB concentration (McBride et al., 1993;
Boehm & Soller, 2012). Many waterborne pathogens,
particularly viruses, infect only humans. Much of the
waterborne disease burden in developed countries is
attributed to viral infections (Hopkins et al., 1984;
Bosch et al., 1991; Reynolds et al., 2008); therefore,
human sewage contamination is considered very risky
(Bosch, 1998; Lodder et al., 1999; Field & Samadpour,
2007). Elevated FIB concentrations resulting from input
from comingled sources where human sewage is a minimal factor, such as stormwater, generally have relatively
lower human health risks than sewage-impacted waters
(Ferguson et al., 1996; Wade et al., 2008). The FIB paradigm does not allow one to determine or account for
differential human health risk from various fecal
sources, as most animals shed these bacteria in their
feces.
Added to the issue of differential risk from various
contamination sources is the capability of naturalized or
environmentally adapted strains of FIB to persist in many
habitats, including terrestrial soils, aquatic sediments, and
aquatic vegetation (Byappanahalli & Fujioka, 1998; SoloGabriele et al., 2000; Byappanahalli et al., 2003; Topp
et al., 2003; Whitman et al., 2003; Jeng et al., 2005; Ishii
et al., 2006; Ksoll et al., 2007; Badgley et al., 2011). FIB
persistence, and possibly growth, in these environmental
habitats widens the disconnect between FIB and pathogens. Furthermore, the near-ubiquitous distribution of
FIB among host species prohibits the identification of
sources of contamination, which in turn interferes with
remediation of polluted waters.

Molecular methods for fecal source determination

Performance criteria for method validation

Throughout this review, the terminology used will be consistent with that in Stoeckel and Harwood (Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007). The validation of MST markers (see Fig. 1) is
accomplished by assessing certain performance criteria,
including sensitivity and specificity (Bernhard & Field,
2000b; Scott et al., 2005; McQuaig et al., 2006; Ufnar et al.,
2006; Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007). Sensitivity refers to the
proportion of known positive samples (e.g. positive controls) that are correctly identified as positive (true-positive
rate). Sensitivity of a method may be influenced by physical
or chemical properties of the matrix or sample type (e.g.
particulate matter, inhibitors such as humic acids)
(Haugland et al., 2005; Siefring et al., 2008); therefore, the
intrinsic sensitivity of a method (distribution of the marker
in the population) is most accurately assessed in a neutral
matrix, that is, by adding feces or sewage to a buffer solution (Harwood et al., 2009). Sensitivity should also be measured in a variety of water types found in the study region
in order to determine whether the method is subject to
inhibition from constituents of the water (Harwood et al.,
2011). Because sensitivity may vary due to geographic
variability of the distribution of the marker in the human
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

population, sensitivity is often determined across a geographic range, and should always be verified in a new geographic region (Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Scott et al., 2005;
McQuaig et al., 2006; Ufnar et al., 2006; Stoeckel &
Harwood, 2007; Harwood et al., 2009).
The limit of detection (LOD) is a quantitative or semiquantitative expression of the lowest amount of target
that can be detected. A useful MST method must not
only be sensitive to low target numbers in the analytical
stage, but it must also have a target that is at high
enough levels in feces or waste so that it can be diluted
and still be detected (Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007;
Harwood & Stoeckel, 2011). LOD of the analytical stage
is frequently calculated as the minimum number of gene
copies as per PCR that can be reliably detected (Bernhard
& Field, 2000b; McQuaig et al., 2006, 2009; Kildare et al.,
2007; Kirs & Smith, 2007; Okabe et al., 2007; Reischer
et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2008); however, this method has
little relevance to the performance of the method in the
field. It can also be calculated as the amount of source
material (typically sewage or feces) required to reliably
obtain a positive result (Seurinck et al., 2005; Betancourt
& Fujioka, 2006; Layton et al., 2006; McQuaig et al.,
2006; Harwood et al., 2009), or as the maximum dilution
factor at which the target can be reliably detected
(Harwood et al., 2009), both of which provide better
insight into the methods’ potential for performance in
the field. Similarly, the limit of quantification (LOQ) is
fewest gene copies or the least amount of fecal material
that can be accurately quantified, which is frequently an
order of magnitude greater (less sensitive) than the LOD.
The literature is confusing with respect to the methodological limits, as some are expressed as per assay (how
little can be in the tube and still be detected or quantified), while others are expressed as protocol limits of
detection, which include loss through processing steps.
Another issue is the fact that some markers, like the 16S
rRNA gene, are present in multiple copies as per genome,
while others are single-copy genes. These differences must
be taken into account when converting from gene copies
to genome equivalents; the latter is the most direct comparison to the number of microorganisms present. Yet
another potential point of confusion is how quantitative
results are normalized, that is, one may express results as
gene copies (or genome equivalents) per ng DNA, or one
may normalize to a more familiar unit in environmental
microbiology such as gene copies in 100 mL water. Normalizing the results from fecal matter is also an issue; in
some instances, LOD or LOQ is normalized to ng DNA,
to dry weight of feces, to wet weight of feces, or to
dilution factor. Clearly, some agreement among MST
researchers is needed on this issue to be able to compare
method performance.

various water bodies range from human (Bernhard &
Field, 2000b; McQuaig et al., 2006) to agricultural
animals (Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Shanks et al., 2008;
Weidhaas et al., 2010) to pets (Kildare et al., 2007) and
wild animals such as gulls (Sinigalliano et al., 2010; Lu
et al., 2011). Many MST publications have focused solely
or in part on human source contamination, as this issue
tends to be the greatest concern for managers and regulators, resulting in a confusing proliferation of MST methods for markers designed to detect human waste.
This review focuses on library-independent methods
for human source contamination and includes a brief
overview of methods for identifying fecal contamination
from other animals. The review emphasizes qPCR methods with the rationale that the movement in the research
area is toward these quantitative methods; the consequences of which are that (1) the more promising endpoint PCR methods have been adapted as qPCR methods
and (2) much of the new method development in the last
several years has been for qPCR methods; however,
important studies using end-point PCR are included. This
review substantially expands the ground covered by others
(Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Scott et al., 2005; McQuaig
et al., 2006, 2009; Ufnar et al., 2006; Field & Samadpour,
2007; Shanks et al., 2010a) by focusing on a critical
review of the performance of the methods and the correlation between MST markers and pathogen detection or
human health risk.

coverage and confidence in method performance. aThe threshold for rejecting a candidate human-associated marker (HAM) HAM based on falsenegative (Level 1 sensitivity) or false-positive (Level 2 specifity) results also depends upon the desired confidence in the method; in practice, many
methods with c. 90% specificity and even lower sensitivity have proven useful for MST.

various methods for detection of human waste. The section ‘Further evaluation of methods’ describes studies that
further test method performance, including comparative
studies. Some of the studies included in this section
incorporated substantial field validation, which is
reported under ‘Selected Field Studies’ and captured for
human-associated methods in Fig. 2. Note that in some
cases, initial studies showed highly promising results for
new methods, only to reveal important flaws with further
testing (Further evaluation of methods). Throughout the
Evaluation sections, correlations with FIB are noted when
applicable. The penultimate section, ‘Correlation with
pathogens and risks of waterborne illness’ focuses on correlation of MST marker detection with pathogens and/or
human health risk, and the final section provides a brief
synopsis of MST methods for animal fecal sources.

Initial evaluation of methods
Human-associated Bacteroidales

One of the first library-independent methods developed
for the detection of human fecal contamination was based
on end-point PCR detection of the 16S rRNA gene of
human-associated Bacteroidales (Bernhard & Field,
2000b). Some detail is devoted to this method because it
served as a precursor to many of the human-associated
methods discussed below and in Table 1. The obligate
anaerobic Bacteroides-Prevotella taxon was targeted due to
high concentrations in feces and tendency to coevolve
with the host (Bernhard & Field, 2000b). A forward primer targeting apparently human-specific members of the
Bacteroidales was paired with a general reverse primer
(Bac708R) targeting a much broader phylogenetic group.
Two ‘human-specific’ forward primers HF134F and
HF183F were designed, the most useful of which was
HF183F due to its sensitivity and specificity. The HF183F
PCR product was amplified by a second round of PCR to
increase sensitivity, which was over 84% (n = 13) in
human fecal samples and 100% (n = 3) in sewage. Specificity, determined by testing negative control fecal samples
from domestic and wild animals (n = 46), was 100%.
The LOD was 10 12 g DNA or 105 gene copies. Sewage
could be detected at a concentration as low as
1.4 9 10 6 g L 1 (dry weight/volume), which was one
order of magnitude higher (less sensitive) than the LOD
for fecal coliforms. This marker, which is frequently
termed HF183 in the literature and whose sequence has
been found in the 16S rRNA gene of the cultured Bacteroides dorei (Haugland et al., 2010), has since been used
in many field tests. It has also been extensively compared
with other human markers described below.

Method specificity is defined as the proportion of fecal/
waste samples from nontarget hosts (species other than
those whose waste the method is designed to detect) that
produce negative test results, or 1 minus the false-positive
rate (Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007). Fecal and/or sewage
samples are the reference material generally used for negative controls for specificity testing. No standards regarding the number of reference samples or host types used
for specificity testing have been established, and a wide
range of these parameters has been employed in various
studies, (Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Scott et al., 2005;
Ufnar et al., 2006; Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007; Griffith
et al., 2009; Harwood et al., 2009; McQuaig et al., 2009;
Mieszkin et al., 2009; Shanks et al., 2010a), thus the
appropriate procedure for measuring this important criterion remains undefined. Certainly, analyzing as many
nontarget fecal samples as possible for specificity is desirable, as it provides more confidence that limitations to
method specificity are understood (Harwood & Stoeckel,
2011). Some of the MST methods discussed below
showed enviable specificity in initial testing; however,
when more fecal samples were tested, the presence of the
marker in other animal feces was determined.
A recent trend has been to adapt end-point (presence/
absence) PCR methods to the quantitative PCR (qPCR,
also called real-time PCR) format, or to develop new
qPCR methods (Dick & Field, 2004; Seurinck et al., 2005;
Kildare et al., 2007; McQuaig et al., 2009). qPCR is rapid,
does not require gel electrophoresis of PCR amplicons,
and measures fluorescence with each PCR cycle to quantify the specific DNA sequence targeted by the method
(Walker, 2002). If a probe is used in addition to primers,
for example, TaqMan© chemistry, additional specificity
can be gained. An important performance characteristic
of qPCR is amplification efficiency, which is measured
from the standard curve and estimates the multiplication
factor of the DNA sequence with each qPCR cycle. Ideally, amplification efficiency is 1.0 (gene copies doubled
with each round of qPCR, also expressed as 100%); however, this parameter may be affected by factors such as
reagent concentrations, PCR cycling conditions, primer
design, and amplicon size (Heid et al., 1996). Amplification efficiency (Ex) can be estimated from the slope of
the standard curve by the equation Ex = (10 1/slope) 1
(Deprez et al., 2002). We are unaware of any guidance on
acceptable ranges for amplification efficiency; however,
values closer to 1.0 indicate greater efficiency.
The section entitled ‘Initial evaluation of methods’
describes the performance characteristics observed in initial publications of methods for human-associated markers (HAM). Table 1 provides specifics on sensitivity,
specificity, LOD, and LOQ, as well as a notation on
whether a field study was performed, while Fig. 2 pro-

Methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene of
Bacteroidales
Many qPCR methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene of
human-associated Bacteroidales have been developed
(Seurinck et al., 2005; Layton et al., 2006; Kildare et al.,
2007; Okabe et al., 2007; Reischer et al., 2007; Lee et al.,
2010; Shanks et al., 2010a) (Figs 2 and 3). Several of
these primers overlap in the short 600-bp region targeted
by most assays, and most of the primers and probes
described show 100% identity to portions of the 16S
rRNA gene of B. dorei (Fig. 3). In this review, we will
refer to methods that target this sequence and closely
related ones as ‘human-associated Bacteroides.’ Less closely related or well-defined groups will be referred to by
the designation of the Order Bacteroidales. Differences in
sensitivity or specificity among assays may result from the
location of primers and probes at positions that are
heterogeneous among other members of this genus.
The characteristics and performance of these methods
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

are summarized in Table 1, including performance
measurements of sensitivity, specificity, LOD, and LOQ.
Seurinck et al. developed a qPCR method based on
SYBR Green chemistry using the HF183 primer and a
new reverse primer that specifically targeted the humanassociated sequence (Seurinck et al., 2005). The authors
did not name the new reverse primer; here, we designate
it SSHBac-R. The method was highly sensitive and specific (Table 1); however, one false-positive result was generated by a chicken fecal sample. As is frequently the case
with HAM, the distribution in individual fecal samples
was not ubiquitous (6 of 7 samples positive). Table 1
shows the LOD and LOQ of the qPCR method. Endpoint PCR using the same primer set was unexpectedly
two orders of magnitude less sensitive than the qPCR
method, that is, c. 107 vs. 105 gene copies L 1, respectively.
Another method targeting human-associated Bacteroides proved to be less specific. A TaqMan© qPCR method
(designated HuBac) showed 100% sensitivity for human
fecal samples (Layton et al., 2006), but specificity was
only 68% when tested against domestic animal fecal samples, showing cross-reactivity with all species (Table 1).
Further studies of the performance of this marker (see
‘Further evaluation of methods’) have confirmed the
imperfect specificity of this method.
The TaqMan qPCR method designated BacHum-UCD
(Kildare et al., 2007) was much more specific than the HuBac method (Table 1). Although its sensitivity toward
human fecal samples was imperfect at 67%, it was 100%
sensitive to raw sewage samples. This work also compared
the new BacHum-UCD method with existing qPCR methods, finding that the LOQ for the SYBR Green HF183
qPCR method described above (Seurinck et al., 2005) was
about 10-fold more sensitive than BacHum-UCD (3 copies
compared to 30). HF183 specificity was slightly inferior to
that of BacHum-UCD, showing cross-reactivity to 25%
and 14% of dog and cat fecal samples; however, HF183
specificity among all samples tested was 95%. The low
specificity of the HuBac TaqMan method (Layton et al.,
2006) was also confirmed in this study (61%).
Yet another method that targets the 16S rRNA gene of
human-associated Bacteroides is BacH (Reischer et al.,
2007). The sensitivity of the method was nearly 100%
(Table 1) with a specificity of over 99% (one false-positive cat sample), and LOD and LOQ were comparable to
other methods. Field testing was included in this study
(see ‘Selected Field Studies’). The Human-Bac1 qPCR
method (Okabe et al., 2007) showed 100% sensitivity
toward a limited number of human fecal samples; specificity, however, was only 10%, although the marker concentration was several orders of magnitude less for
animal samples compared with human samples.

V.J. Harwood et al.

The BacHuman qPCR method targets similar 16S
rRNA gene sequences (Lee et al., 2010). It was found to
be 100% sensitive to sewage, but it was not tested on
individual human fecal samples and was only 81.5% specific (Table 1). As an alternate measurement of specificity,
Lee et al. determined the percentage of BacHuman copies
relative to general Bacteroides marker (BacGeneral) copies
in each fecal sample. In false-positive analyses, the relative
quantity of the BacHuman target represented c. 1.8% of
the general Bacteroides target detected in a fecal sample,
while the relative proportion of BacHuman detections in
human samples (true-positive analyses) was nearly 50
times larger. Field testing showed weak correlation of
total Bacteroidales with E. coli (Supporting Information,
Table S1), and the BacHuman marker comprised a
greater percentage of the overall Bacteroidales signal in a
ª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies

stream contaminated with human sewage as opposed to a
stream contaminated with cattle feces in which the BacHuman marker represented < 1% of the total Bacteroidales signal.
The alternative approach chosen by Haugland, et al.
(Haugland et al., 2010) relied on cultured members of
the Bacteroidales rather than gene sequences from uncultured bacteria. This work developed several more TaqMan qPCR methods targeting the hypervariable V2
region of the 16S rRNA gene (Haugland et al., 2010).
The authors reasoned that methods targeting cultured
species may be valuable in MST because calibration can
then be accomplished using genomic DNA rather than a
plasmid, and the qPCR results can then be compared
against culture-dependent methods. Primer sets were
developed to target six different Bacteroides species,

2007), G (Lee et al., 2010), H (Layton et al., 2006), and I (Okabe et al., 2007). All primers and probes were 100% identical to the B. dorei
sequence used for alignment except HuBac566f (95%), BacH_r (68%), and BFDFor (55%). Only the portion of the oligonucleotide sequence that
is identical to that of B. dorei is shown in the figure in the case of nonidentical sequences.

Molecular methods for fecal source determination

Other Bacteroidales gene targets
Bacteroides genes other than 16S rRNA gene have been
incorporated into MST methods, for example, a TaqMan
qPCR assay targeting the single-copy a-1,6-mannanase
gene of B. thetaiotaomicron (BT) (Yampara-Iquise et al.,
2008). The sensitivity of the method was 100% among
human fecal samples and sewage, and it was 100% specific against composite fecal samples from domestic animals and wildlife collected from across Missouri.
Srinivasan et al. recently evaluated this marker relative to
E. coli and enterococci levels by qPCR through wastewater and septage treatment (Srinivasan et al., 2011), finding
that its removal through wastewater treatment was similar
to that of E. coli and enterococci.
Shanks et al. developed two TaqMan qPCR methods
for the detection of human-associated Bacteroidales that
targeted a hypothetical protein (HumM2) and a putative
RNA polymerase sigma factor (HumM3) (Shanks et al.,
2009). Both assays showed 100% sensitivity when tested
against feces and wastewater sampled throughout the U.S.
HumM2 had slightly higher specificity (99.2%, crossreacting with sheep and elk) compared to HumM3
(97.2%, cross-reacting with chickens). Reactions included
an internal amplification control to test for inhibition.
The authors found that primary-treated wastewater effluent contained higher concentrations of the human markers than Enterococcus 16S rRNA genes.
A different gene, gyrB of B. fragilis, was the target of a
TaqMan qPCR (Lee & Lee, 2010). End-point PCR
showed 100% sensitivity among human fecal samples
with a specificity of 97% (false positive for one pig sample). The qPCR results showed levels of the marker in
negative control fecal samples (cow, dog, and pig) that
were c. 100-fold lower than levels in human feces. Comparison with the Human-Bac1 method (Okabe et al.,
2007) again confirmed the low specificity of HumanBac1, as cross-reaction occurred in samples from 70% of
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

pigs, 40% of cows, and 30% of dogs for overall specificity
of only 57%.
Bifidobacterium

Members of the genus Bifidobacterium are anaerobic,
gram-positive rods that are abundant in intestinal microbial communities of humans and some animals (Bonjoch
et al., 2004; King et al., 2007). Several end-point PCR
methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene have been developed for use in human MST studies (Bonjoch et al.,
2004; King et al., 2007; Lamendella et al., 2008), but subsequent research has demonstrated that B. adolescentis is
not confined to the human gastrointestinal tract. An evaluation of end-point PCR methods targeting Bifidobacterium showed that a set of B. adolescentis primers amplified
fecal DNA from cows, as well as from pigs, sheep, a
chicken, a coyote, a deer, and an alpaca (Lamendella
et al., 2008). Another study found that the same primers
amplified DNA from cows, pigs, and a sheep (Dorai-Raj
et al., 2009).
A TaqMan qPCR assay targeting Bifidobacterium adolescentis (ADO) (Gourmelon et al., 2010b) showed high
sensitivity in human fecal samples and WWTP effluent
from France (Table 1). Specificity was nearly 95%,
although some false positives were obtained from some
cow and bird samples. A comparison of the B. adolescentis qPCR method to the Bacteroides HF183 qPCR assay
(Seurinck et al., 2005) showed that HF183 was more specific (100%) than the B. adolescentis method and was not
detected in the river samples with known fecal contamination from cattle. F+ RNA coliphage subgroups were
also evaluated in this study, but the human-associated
groups II and III were found in runoff contaminated with
cow feces as well as in sewage, and animal-associated
group I coliphages were found in effluent from both
humans and nonhumans.
Enterococcus faecium esp gene

An end-point PCR method targeting the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene of E. faecium was developed to
identify human fecal contamination (Scott et al., 2005;
Ahmed et al., 2008). This method utilized a culture step
to increase target cell numbers. Although the method was
97% sensitive and 100% specific in this study, other studies have detected some level of Ent. faecium esp in the
feces of animals (Harada et al., 2004; Whitman et al.,
2007; Layton et al., 2009).
A SYBR green qPCR method targeting the esp gene
that does not require a culture step was developed and
tested in Australia (Ahmed et al., 2008). The method
employed the previously utilized forward primer specific

including B. dorei and one Prevotella species. Forward
primers were HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, BfragF1, BthetaF2,
BvulgF1, and PcopriF1 markers. When the methods were
tested using sewage and composited fecal samples from
humans and domestic animals, all species markers were
present in human waste in high abundance (3.17–4.3
log10 copy number ng 1 total DNA). None of the markers were completely specific to humans, and the presence
and abundance of each marker varied among different
animals (Table 1). Performance of the HF183 marker was
superior in that it was abundant in human feces, was
detected in low quantity in chicken and dog feces (0.35
and 0.36 log10 copy number per 1 ng total DNA, respectively), and was absent from cow, pig, and cat waste.

Methanobrevibacter smithii

Methanobrevibacter smithii, a methanogenic archaeon specific to the human large intestine and vaginal tract, was
found in 96% of 700 individual fecal specimens (Ufnar
et al., 2006; Dridi et al., 2009). An end-point PCR
method targeting the nifH gene was only 29% sensitive
among individual human fecal samples but showed 93%
sensitivity among sewage samples and 100% specificity
(Ufnar et al., 2006). The prevalence of M. smithii by this
method has been further compared against other HAM
including human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) and human
Bacteroides as well as the presence of adenovirus (see
‘Further evaluation of methods’).
A TaqMan qPCR method was subsequently developed
that targets a shorter fragment of the nifH gene (Johnston
et al., 2010) (Table 1). The method utilized a competitive
internal control DNA fragment to detect and allow
adjustment for PCR inhibition. The method was tested
using 23 nontarget methanogenic species, all of which
were negative. The qPCR method showed 100% sensitivity in blind-tested marine and freshwater samples containing known sewage or a sewage spike, and it was able
to detect the marker at 100-fold lower concentrations
than the end-point method; however, cross-reactivity with
bird feces was observed (Table 1).
A subsequent study conducted in Australia evaluated
the host specificity and sensitivity of the nifH gene marker by testing it against fecal and wastewater samples
from 11 animal species, including humans (n = 272)
(Ahmed et al., 2012). The host specificity reported in this
particular study was 96%, while sensitivity of the marker
to human sewage was 81%. This study also tested prevalence of the marker in environmental water samples and
found it to be relatively low compared with other markers tested (esp, HF183, HPyVs, and Adenoviruses). The

authors concluded that the nifH marker alone may not be
sensitive enough to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters but that relatively high host-specificity merits
its use in conjunction with other human markers.
Lachnospiraceae

Newton et al. developed a TaqMan qPCR assay targeting
the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene of members of the
family Lachnospiraceae that are closely related to Blautia
spp. (Lachno2) (Newton et al., 2011). This taxon is the
second most abundant bacterial group in human fecal
samples, making up 0.3–0.9% of the population in wastewater samples. Although no sensitivity or specificity testing was performed against sewage or feces, the
concentration of the Lachno2 target was compared with
HF183 by qPCR (Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Kildare et al.,
2007), culturable E. coli and enterococci concentrations,
enterococci concentrations enumerated by qPCR, and
presence of adenovirus at sites in Milwaukee’s harbor. A
strong correlation was observed between concentrations
of Lachno2 and HF183 (r = 0.86) and Lachno2 and
enterococci enumerated by qPCR (r = 0.91). Furthermore, logistic regression showed a strong correlation
between human marker concentration (Lachno2 plus
HF183) and the detection frequency of adenovirus, indicating a link between these markers and human pathogen
presence.
Escherichia coli

Although E. coli has been used and studied extensively as
an indicator bacterium, less success has been achieved
using this organism for MST applications. Substantial
efforts were made with earlier library-based techniques
such as antibiotic resistance, ribotyping, or DNA fingerprinting (Dombek et al., 2000; Harwood et al., 2000;
Carson et al., 2001; Stoeckel & Harwood, 2007), but we
know of no library-independent assays in use that are
based on host-specific E. coli markers. It is worth mentioning, though, that this may change in the near future,
as molecular techniques provide increasing power to
examine genetic differences in bacterial groups, and
recent studies have shown promise in this regard. One
study found evidence of a potentially human-specific
strain of E. coli that belongs to the B2 clonal subgroup
VIII with an O81 serotype (Clermont et al., 2008). This
clone represented c. 4% of the E. coli isolates recovered
from human fecal samples from four continents and was
not identified from any animal fecal isolates in the study.
More recently, full genome sequencing was used to identify several candidate genes that may be specific to E. coli
strains of either environmental or enteric origin (Luo

to esp of Ent. faecium (Scott et al., 2005) and a reverse
primer containing a sequence shared by Ent. faecium and
Ent. faecalis (Hammerum & Jensen, 2002). Sensitivity was
high, particularly in domestic sewage, while septic system
samples, which represent a smaller population, were not
as frequently positive (Table 1). Specificity was 100%
when tested against twelve types of fecal samples from
domestic animals and wildlife in Australia. Sewage dilutions were detectable at dilutions as great as 10 4, which
corresponded to 48  7 CFU cultured enterococci, and
esp gene concentrations were generally one to two orders
of magnitude lower than cultured enterococci. However,
a qPCR method targeting the Bacteroides HF183 marker
(Bernhard et al., 2003; Seurinck et al., 2005) allowed
detection of sewage at much greater dilutions (five orders
of magnitude) than the Ent. faecium esp method.

HPyVs

HPyVs are highly specific to humans with a high prevalence in human populations (Taguchi et al., 1982;
McQuaig et al., 2009). The viruses are shed primarily in
urine, but also in feces, and high titers have been
reported in municipal sewage (Bofill-Mas et al., 2000;
McQuaig, 2009). An end-point PCR method was developed for the detection of HPyVs (including BK virus and
JC virus) in environmental waters (McQuaig et al., 2006).
The method showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. The
HPyVs method was adapted to a TaqMan qPCR assay
following the modification of one of the original primers
(McQuaig et al., 2009). The TaqMan qPCR method for
HPyVs was evaluated against end-point PCR assays for
human Bacteroides HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b),
M. smithii (Ufnar et al., 2006), and adenovirus (Pina
et al., 1998). The HPyVs qPCR method was 100% specific
(Table 1) when tested against fecal and urine samples.
HPyVs were detected in 23% of human urine samples
and in 100% of sewage and septic system samples. All
other markers were also 100% sensitive in sewage but
were less sensitive among septic samples. A qPCR assay
that targets only polyomavirus JC has been developed;
however, sensitivity and specificity were not tested for this
method (Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2009).
Pathogenic viruses

qPCR assays targeting a variety of viral pathogens (e.g.
adenovirus and norovirus) have also been explored as a
means of determining sources of fecal contamination
(Wolf et al., 2010); however, these pathogens are more
commonly targeted as representatives of human health
risk rather than source-specific markers (see ‘Correlation
with Pathogens’). Four multiplex qPCRs were developed
targeting norovirus, adenovirus, atadenovirus, and F+
RNA bacteriophage to distinguish among human and animal sources (Table 1). Each assay was able to detect as
few as 10 gene copies, and all assays were reported to
show amplification of the specific viral target but not

Genotyping of F+ (F-specific) RNA coliphages has been
suggested as a possible tool for discriminating between
human and animal sources of fecal contamination (Havelaar et al., 1990; Hsu et al., 1995; Stewart-Pullaro et al.,
2006; Gourmelon et al., 2007; Kirs & Smith, 2007; Wolf
et al., 2008). The differential host distribution of these
coliphages was first demonstrated by serotyping (Havelaar
et al., 1990). Among the four subtypes, groups II and III
are more prevalent in human sewage, while groups I and
IV are generally associated with animal feces (Hsu et al.,
1995; Beekwilder et al., 1996; Stewart-Pullaro et al.,
2006). A multiplex qPCR for simultaneously typing and
quantifying F+ RNA coliphages was developed and compared to methods relying on culture of coliphages (Kirs
& Smith, 2007) (Table 1). In seeded samples of sewage
and chicken slurry, the percentage of each group of coliphage corresponded to the makeup of the sample.
Another multiplex qPCR method was developed to
detect and genotype F+ RNA coliphages in New Zealand
(Wolf et al., 2008); however, no formal sensitivity or
specificity testing was conducted. A subsequent study utilized modified primers and probe, and the method was
used in a ‘viral toolbox’ approach that included multiplex
qPCR assays for noroviruses, adenoviruses, and atadenovirus (Wolf et al., 2010). F+ RNA coliphages were rarely
detected in human feces, but were much more prevalent
in pig, deer, and cattle feces. In particular, the humanassociated group II F+ RNA coliphages were prevalent in
pig and cattle feces (80% and 50%, respectively). Environmental samples including wastewater influent, shellfish, abbatoir (slaughterhouse) effluent, biosolids, and
river water were analyzed. Although the human-associated
groups II and III were the most prevalent and at the
highest concentration in sewage influent samples, animalassociated group I coliphages were detected in 55% of
sewage samples at c. 105 gene copies. Only groups II and
III were detected in biosolids. Animal-associated, group
IV F+ RNA coliphages were only found in sewage (18%
of samples); however, abbatoir effluent contained only
group I coliphages. The imperfect specificity of the F+
RNA coliphage groups toward human or animal fecal
waste merits host-associated, rather than host-specific
designation for these markers.

metagenome in human feces (Zhang et al., 2006; Rosario
et al., 2009). The TaqMan qPCR method (Zhang et al.,
2006) showed 100% sensitivity toward raw and treated
wastewater collected across the U.S. (Table 1); however,
specificity was around 70% due to cross-reactivity with
chicken and gull feces or intestinal homogenates (Rosario
et al., 2009). This virus shows great persistence through
wastewater treatment, although it does decay in environmental waters, with a half-life of about 1.5 days in seawater. PMMoV may therefore be useful as a conservative
tracer of sewage contamination.

Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

The first ‘fecal source tracking’ method based on a
eukaryotic genetic marker was the end-point PCR assay
targeting the human mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase
subunit (Martellini et al., 2005). mtDNA was proposed as
a marker based upon the premise that it should be abundant in feces (Caldwell et al., 2007). The PCR method
was initially developed in both single and multiplex formats with primers specific to humans, cows, sheep, and
pigs. Sensitivity and specificity were not explicitly
reported; however, the human mtDNA marker was
detected in human feces, treated wastewater, and ultraviolet disinfected effluent, but not in swinery effluent.
Human, cattle, and pig markers were detected in sewage.
Several groups have adapted human mtDNA PCR
methods to qPCR formats (Table 1) (Caldwell et al.,
2007; Schill & Mathes, 2008; Caldwell & Levine, 2009). A
multiplex qPCR method targeting the mitochondrial
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene from
humans, cattle, and pigs was developed (Caldwell et al.,
2007). Amplification efficiency for the human marker was
92% for a single qPCR and 107% for the triplex reaction.
The multiplex assay detected human mtDNA from individual human fecal samples and sewage samples with
100% and 60% sensitivity, respectively. Specificity of the
human marker was 100% when tested against cow
(n = 4) and pig (n = 3) farm samples and also 100%
against an unreported number of fecal samples from nine
other animals. Due to some false-negative results in samples from mixed sources, the authors noted that adequate
DNA concentration was clearly a concern for detecting
mtDNA markers. Some false-positive results for the cattle
marker were also noted when testing human feces, which
the authors hypothesized could be caused by beef consumption. A later study by the same group confirmed the
sensitivity of the human marker: it was detected in 100%
of sewage samples from two WWTP by multiplex qPCR
(Caldwell & Levine, 2009).
ª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies
Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved

qPCR methods targeting the cytochrome b gene in
mtDNA from humans and eight other vertebrates were
developed (Schill & Mathes, 2008). Average amplification
efficiency for all markers was 97.6%. The human mtDNA
method detected individual human fecal samples and
sewage samples with 100% sensitivity. Specificity of the
human marker was 100% when tested against fecal samples from domestic animals and wildlife as well as cloned
genes from other hosts. The authors also analyzed sewage
samples by qPCR for the Bacteroidales microbial markers,
that is, AllBac for general fecal contamination (Layton
et al., 2006) and both HF183 (Seurinck et al., 2005) and
BT (Carson et al., 2005) as HAM, finding all to be 100%
sensitive. The LOD for the human mtDNA marker was
reported as 1.8 mg human feces per 100 mL, which is
more than 100 times lower than the LOD for the multiplex qPCR method (Caldwell & Levine, 2009). The more
extensive DNA extraction and concentration method of
Schill et al. may account for this variation (Schill &
Mathes, 2008). Although no field testing was performed
in this study, sixteen freshwater surface samples and
groundwater samples were used to test for matrix interference, and no matrix inhibition was detected.

Further evaluation of methods
Many studies have confirmed the high sensitivity and
limited specificity of HF183 and related Bacteroides-like
markers, such as the previously mentioned study by Kildare et al. (Kildare et al., 2007). In Canada, the HF183
method was 100% specific and 87% sensitive against
effluent from a local wastewater treatment facility (Edge
et al., 2010). A study using the BacHum-UCD (Kildare
et al., 2007) qPCR method confirmed the method’s utility, but also found some limited cross-reactivity with
cow, dog, and horse fecal samples (Table 1) (Silkie &
Nelson, 2009). Twenty-five percent of dog fecal samples
and 20% of cat fecal samples were positive for the HF183
marker by end-point PCR; however, qPCR was not performed in this study (McQuaig et al., 2009). The HF183
qPCR method (Seurinck et al., 2005) was used in freshwater to quantify sewage contamination in urban lake in
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Ahmed et al., 2010). Sensitivity of
the marker was 87% and specificity was 93% (detected in
one dog and one cat) against samples from cows, dogs,
cats, and chickens.
Comparative studies of human-associated
Bacteroidales markers

Several studies have compared PCR methods for humanassociated Bacteroidales markers. A comparison of qPCR
assays using the HF183 and BacHum-UCD markers was

nontarget viruses. When tested against fecal samples from
humans and animals, only host-specific viruses were
amplified (e.g. only human-specific viruses were detected
in human fecal samples). The assays were also tested
against environmental samples as well as sewage influent
and abattoir effluent, and while some animal viruses were
detected in sewage and biosolid samples, human-specific
viral targets were detected at higher concentrations. While
the assays were shown to have a high level of sensitivity,
variable rates of virus shedding, uncertain incidences of
viral infection, and survival of viral particles in the environment impair the ability of these methods to accurately
reflect source contributions to environmental waters.

2006), and fish DNA amplified with a similar efficiency
to human fecal DNA; however, it is important to note
that the HuBac qPCR method is among the least specific
of the human-associated Bacteroides methods.
Single laboratory studies evaluating
multiple HAM

The performance of human-associated MST markers
other than Bacteroidales has been compared in several
studies. F+ RNA coliphage typing using oligonucleotide
probes (Beekwilder et al., 1996) and species-specific Bacteroidales detection by end-point PCR were evaluated in
environmental water samples, sewage, and fecal samples
in France (Gourmelon et al., 2007). F+ RNA coliphages
were detected in relatively few fecal samples (21%) and
were therefore not tested for specificity, but were more
frequently detected in the pig manure slurry (60%) and
sewage (100%; groups II and III). Both the HF183 and
HF134 markers for human-associated Bacteroidales (Bernhard & Field, 2000b) were highly sensitive and specific,
although both cross-reacted with one chicken fecal sample. Fourteen of 28 environmental water samples contained no F+ coliphage, but all of them contained the
general Bacteroidales marker (Bac 32F/708R) (Bernhard &
Field, 2000a). Furthermore, the probability of detecting at
least one human marker was significantly correlated with
E. coli concentrations (P < 0.001), and the same was true
of human-associated F+ coliphage groups II and III
(P = 0.015).
End-point PCR methods using the HPyVs marker,
human-associated Bacteroides HF183 (Bernhard & Field,
2000b) and the esp gene of Ent. faecium (Scott et al.,
2005), were compared with concentrations of cultured
FIB (E. coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens) as well
as human pathogens [adenoviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, and torque teno viruses (TTC)] in Australia (Ahmed et al., 2009b). Sensitivity and specificity for each
method were determined using sewage samples and individual fecal samples from cattle, pigs, sheep, dogs, and
ducks. All three methods showed 100% sensitivity to sewage samples. HF183 showed cross-reactivity with one dog
sample and had a specificity of 98% while esp and HPyVs
had specificities of 100%. The LOD was ten gene copies
for esp and HPyVs, and one gene copy for HF183.
These markers (HF183, esp, and HPyVs) were further
validated against sewage that was serially diluted in several water types (Ahmed et al., 2009b). HF183 could be
detected in freshwater, seawater, and distilled water in
more dilute samples than culturable FIB (E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens), that is, at dilutions of 10 7 and
10 8. The esp marker was detected in all waters at a 10 4
dilution, corresponding to FIB concentrations of

performed on DNA extracts from fecal and environmental water samples from Kenya (Jenkins et al., 2009)
(Table 1). While both methods were 100% specific to
human sources, the BacHum-UCD (Kildare et al., 2007)
method was less sensitive toward human fecal samples
and sewage than the HF183 method. Five human-associated Bacteroides PCR methods [HF183 (Bernhard & Field,
2000b), BacHum-UCD (Kildare et al., 2007), HuBac
(Layton et al., 2006), BacH (Reischer et al., 2007), and
Human-Bac (Okabe et al., 2007)], were tested against
sewage and fecal samples in Australia (Ahmed et al.,
2009a). All methods were 100% sensitive, but specificity
ranged from 99% (HF183) to 63% for HuBac (Table 1).
A comparison of assays for human-associated Bacteroidales evaluated the performance of ten qPCR methods
and five end-point PCR methods against sewage and fecal
samples from 22 different animal species (Shanks et al.,
2010a). The end-point methods tested were for the
HF183 and HF134 markers (Bernhard & Field, 2000b),
BT (Carson et al., 2005), HumM19, and HumM22
(Shanks et al., 2007). The qPCR methods targeted HuBac,
HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, BfragF1, BthetaF2, BvulgF1,
HumM2, HumM3, and PcopriF1 (Shanks et al., 2010a)
(Table 1). HF183 and HumM19 markers showed the best
performance among end-point methods, with 100% sensitivity toward sewage samples, more than 10% sensitivity
at the lowest total DNA concentration, and 95% specificity. All methods had amplification efficiencies between
89% and 99.5%, R2 values > 0.96, range of quantification
(ROQ) of 10 to at least 4 9 104 gene copies, CT precision
of < 3.0% mean coefficient of variation across the ROQ,
and over 98% sensitivity toward sewage. However, only
the HF183, HumM2, and BsteriF1 assays also showed
> 99% sensitivity, high abundance in human waste, and
high specificity toward nontarget hosts (91%). HuBac
showed the greatest abundance in nonhuman waste samples and was detected in 77% of animal fecal samples.
A comparative study by McLain, et al. of five humanassociated Bacteroidales PCR assays found cross-amplification with fish feces (McLain et al., 2009). End-point PCR
assays for HuBac (Layton et al., 2006), BacHum-UCD
(Kildare et al., 2007), BacH (Reischer et al., 2007), HF183
(Seurinck et al., 2005), and HF134 (Bernhard & Field,
2000b) were used to amplify fecal DNA from humans,
Nile tilapia, channel catfish, rainbow trout, and Atlantic
salmon. The HuBac method produced a PCR product
with all four types of fish feces, the BacH method gave a
positive result with all fish except Atlantic salmon, and
the BacHum-UCD and HF183 methods generated PCR
products only with rainbow trout. The HF134 method
did not amplify DNA from any of the fish feces. Crossamplification of fish fecal DNA was further evaluated
using the HuBac TaqMan qPCR method (Layton et al.,

tory comparison was performed to evaluate the success of
F+ coliphage typing (Hsu et al., 1995) as well as host-specific Bacteroides markers including the HF183 human
marker (Bernhard & Field, 2000b) at determining the
source of fecal contamination in blind samples spiked
with fecal material (Field et al., 2003; Griffith et al.,
2003). Methods targeting adenoviruses and enteroviruses
(Noble et al., 2003) were also evaluated as well as several
genotypic and phenotypic library-dependent methods
(Harwood et al., 2003; Myoda et al., 2003). The HF183
method correctly identified 100% of samples containing
human fecal material, while the F+ coliphage method correctly identified only 10% of samples containing individual human feces but 90% of samples containing sewage
spikes (Griffith et al., 2003). The enterovirus and adenovirus assays also suffered high false-negative rates for
individual fecal samples, but were detected in 60% and
40% of sewage-spiked samples, respectively.
Human sewage and cow, poultry, and pig slaughterhouse effluent and farm samples were tested from Spain
(n = 132), France (n = 3), Sweden (n = 2), the UK
(n = 2), and Cyprus (n = 5) using six human-associated
markers including HF134 and HF 183 (Bernhard & Field,
2000b), esp (Scott et al., 2005), ADO and B. dentium
(DEN) (Walters & Field, 2009), and human mtDNA (Humito) (Martellini et al., 2005; Balleste et al., 2010). None
of the methods showed 100% sensitivity: ADO was most
sensitive (96%), followed by Humito (84%), DEN (64%),
HF183 (50%), HF134 (30%), and esp (4%). When an
enrichment culture step was used for esp analysis [as
specified in the original protocol of Scott, et al. (Scott
et al., 2005)], sensitivity increased to 77%. The most specific assay was DEN (92%), followed by HF134 (81%),
ADO (74%), HF183 (71%), Humito (41%), and esp (6%
and 68% with enrichment). The fact that the HF183 marker showed lower sensitivity and specificity in this study
compared to others described in this review reinforces the
need to evaluate markers using both sewage and individual fecal samples from different geographic areas. Indeed,
the original authors pointed out that HF183 has shown
variable performance depending on geographic location.
Three markers [HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b),
M. smithii (Ufnar et al., 2006), and HPyVs (McQuaig
et al., 2006)] were evaluated using end-point PCR (Harwood et al., 2009). Each method was tested against more
than 40 human fecal samples representing individual
feces, sewage influent, and septic system samples as well
as over 300 animal fecal samples (dogs, cats, cows, birds,
and wild animals) collected from three geographic areas
surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. All assays were 100%
sensitive when tested against 53, 44, and 41 samples,
respectively. The HPyVs method was the most specific
(100%), followed by M. smithii at 98%, and HF183 at

102 CFU 9 100 mL 1 E. coli and 101 CFU 9 100 mL 1
enterococci, while LOD for HPyVs was about 10-fold less
sensitive. Human pathogenic viruses (enteroviruses, sapoviruses, TTV, and adenoviruses) were detected at dilutions as low as c. 10 4. The authors suggested that the
use of pathogenic viruses (enterovirus, sapovirus, and
TTV) as indicators of fecal pollution may be problematic
in the field due to dilution in environmental waters that
might limit the ability to detect these markers (Ahmed
et al., 2009b).
End-point PCR methods targeting presumably humanassociated Bacteroides spp. BT (Walters et al., 2007),
B. vulgatus (BV) (Wang et al., 1994), HF183 (Bernhard &
Field, 2000b), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (biADO) (Matsuki et al., 1998), and Bifidobacterium catenulatum/pseudocantenulatum (biCATg) (Matsuki et al., 1998)] were
tested against human, ruminant, and nonruminant animals (horse, donkey, dog, chicken, goose, and pig fecal
samples) in Ireland (Dorai-Raj et al., 2009). Sensitivity
was evaluated against both individual human fecal samples and sewage. The BV assay showed the greatest sensitivity toward fecal samples (88%) compared with other
assays [BT (65%), HF183 (12%), biADO (85%), and biCATg (46%)]. BV and both Bifidobacterium methods
showed 100% sensitivity to sewage, while BT (39%) and
HF183 (70%) did not perform as well. HF183 was 100%
specific, while the performance of other methods was
adequate, but not as strong (86% for BV, 84% for biADO, 87% for biCATg; BT not being tested).
End-point PCR assays using human-associated Bacteroidales HF134 and HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b), the
esp gene of Ent. faecium (Scott et al., 2005), ADO and
Bifidobacterium dentium (DEN) (Bonjoch et al., 2004),
and human mtDNA (Humito) (Martellini et al., 2005), as
well as animal-specific markers, were evaluated singly and
in combination with their ability to distinguish between
human and nonhuman fecal samples (Balleste et al.,
2010). Human sewage and cow, poultry, and pig slaughterhouse effluent and farm samples were tested from
Spain, France, Sweden, the UK, and Cyprus. Predictive
models identified combinations of methods that showed
improved source identification of fecal samples compared
with individual markers. The best predictive model gave
90.1% correct classification of fecal samples using five
markers: ADO, DEN, HF134, Pomito, and Bomito (a pigand bovine-specific mtDNA marker, respectively).

ferent types of ambient water affected method sensitivity
in some cases.
A multilaboratory method evaluation study called the
‘Source Identification Protocol Project’ (SIPP) was carried
out in 2011 in which sample source was blinded to participating laboratories (Boehm et al., 2013). Results were
published in a series of articles (Stewart et al., 2012; Harwood et al., 2013) that focused on various aspects of the
study, with an overview article that captured the major
findings of the study (Boehm et al., 2013). Forty-one
MST methods were tested for performance criteria such
as sensitivity, specificity, and LOD by 27 laboratories.
Methods evaluated included those targeting human waste
and that of a number of other host species or groups
including cows, dogs, gulls, pigs, horse, and sheep. Participating laboratories chose the methods that each evaluated and used in-house protocols (i.e. they were not
provided standard operating procedures). Each laboratory
received 64 blind ‘challenge’ samples that contained either
a single fecal source or mixture of two sources (1 : 10
ratio by volume) suspended in artificial freshwater (Boehm et al., 2013). Some of the challenge samples were
prepared as 10-fold more dilute suspensions to test
method sensitivity. Dilutions of fecal material were chosen with the goal of creating challenge samples containing
c. 2000 CFU 9 100 mL 1 enterococci; however, in practice, enterococci concentrations varied from 4.3 9 102 to
1.7 9 106 CFU 9 100 mL 1. For most assays, laboratories received membrane filters through which 50 mL of
each challenge sample had been passed. Specificity testing
was carried out against human feces, septage and sewage,
and animal fecal samples (cow, dog, deer, pig, chicken,
pigeon, gull, horse, and goose). The results discussed in
this review include assays (e.g. HF183, BacH, BacHum,
BsteriF1, Btheta, gyrB, HumM2, nifH, BacCow, CowM2,
CowM3, BacCan-UCD, Gull-2, and Pig-2-Bac) that have
been described in earlier sections or in ‘Animal markers’.
The data from the SIPP study were evaluated in both
binary (i.e. all assays were treated as presence/absence)
and quantitative format. All qPCR results were normalized to enterococci CFU, and the method was considered
sensitive if it provided a median of 50 gene copies as per
enterococci CFU (Boehm et al., 2013). Alternative normalization schemes (i.e. DNA mass or copy number of
the general marker of fecal pollution, GenBac3) were also
considered. A limited number of assays met the minimum specificity and sensitivity requirements of 80% that
were arbitrarily set forth by the investigators. When data
were treated in binary fashion, these assays included
HF183 (end-point assay, SYBR Green), CowM2 and
CowM3, BacCan-UCD, and Gull-2 (SYBR Green). When
concentration of a given marker in target and nontarget
hosts was considered, the number of assays meeting the

96%. Each method detected < 20 gene copies as per PCR.
Sewage was spiked in environmental water and diluted to
determine LOD in an environmental matrix. The HF183
method could detect the target in dilutions as low as
10 6, corresponding to 33 CFU 9 100 mL 1 enterococci.
The M. smithii and HPyVs methods were generally two
orders of magnitude less sensitive, losing their ability to
detect the target at dilutions of 10 3–10 4.
A comparative interlaboratory study was conducted by
the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project
(SCCWRP) using 17 methods to assess the presence of
human fecal contamination in waters spiked with known
concentrations of sewage or gull guano (Griffith et al.,
2009). End-point PCR assays were performed for four
human-associated targets including HF183 (Bernhard &
Field, 2000b), esp (Scott et al., 2005), M. smithii (Ufnar
et al., 2006), and HPyVs (McQuaig et al., 2006) while
qPCR assays were performed for two human-associated
Bacteroidales markers (Bernhard & Field, 2000b; Kildare
et al., 2007), and human-associated M. smithii using previously published primers (Ufnar et al., 2006). Several
human pathogenic viruses were also tested, including
adenoviruses, enteroviruses, Hepatitis A, and noroviruses.
Marker performance was evaluated in blind duplicate
environmental water samples that included samples
spiked with sewage, gull guano, or nothing (control).
Sewage was diluted to give ranges from 50 to
104 CFU 9 100 mL 1 for E. coli and enterococci, while
gull guano was diluted to give average FIB concentrations between > 2 9 103 and > 2 9 105 CFU 9
100 mL 1.
Among the methods based on bacteria, the Ent. faecium esp assay (Scott et al., 2005) was highly sensitive
and specific; however, this method requires a 24-h culture
step that is not conducive to rapid target detection. PCR
and qPCR methods targeting HF183 were adequately sensitive (90% and 65%, respectively) and 100% specific;
however, the qPCR method of Kildare, et al. (Kildare
et al., 2007) had a high false-positive rate. End-point
PCR for M. smithii (Ufnar et al., 2006) had a high falsenegative rate (failed to identify sewage-spiked samples)
while the qPCR method for this marker had a high falsepositive rate (produced positive results for unspiked control samples). The HPyVs end-point assay (McQuaig
et al., 2006) was the most accurate among the human
viral methods (65% sensitivity and 100% specificity).
Reproducibility of results for duplicate samples was
also assessed in the SCCWRP study. The end-point
M. smithii method was 100% reproducible, and the
HPyVs method was also highly reproducible (94%).
Other methods, such as qPCR for M. smithii, were much
less reproducible (67%). This study highlights the need to
evaluate methods in different matrices, as spiking in dif-

Survival and persistence studies

The data on survival and persistence of various markers
of human fecal contamination have been predominantly
generated through mesocosm studies utilizing surface
waters (freshwater and marine) inoculated with sewage,
human feces, or pure cultures of organisms of interest
(Kreader, 1998; Seurinck et al., 2005; Okabe et al., 2007;
ª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies
Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved

Bae & Wuertz, 2009; Walters & Field, 2009; Balleste et al.,
2010; Dick et al., 2010; Green et al., 2011a, b; Sokolova
et al., 2012). The majority of the existing literature has
focused on MST methods targeting Bacteroidales and the
effect of selected environmental parameters (e.g. sunlight
exposure, temperature, salinity, protozoa predation) on
their decay.
One of the first such studies investigated persistence of
the end-point PCR signal from Bacteroides distasonis at
different temperatures and in the presence/absence of
eukaryotic predators indigenous to Ohio River water
(Kreader, 1998). Persistence in unfiltered river water was
inversely related to temperature, where B. distasonis DNA
was detectable for up to 14, 5, and 2 days at 4, 14, and
24 °C, respectively (Kreader, 1998). Absence of eukaryotic
predators extended persistence at 24 °C by at least a
week, indicating that grazing by bacterivorous protozoa is
also an important mechanism influencing survival
(Kreader, 1998).
Balleste, et al. investigated the effect of environmental
parameters on survival of B. fragilis, BT, and environmental Bacteroides spp. via culture and molecular techniques (Balleste et al., 2010). The decay of culturable
B. fragilis was strongly influenced by the combined effect
of elevated temperatures and grazing predators, while culturable BT and environmental Bacteroides spp. were more
affected by dissolved oxygen concentrations (Balleste
et al., 2010). In general, culturable environmental strains
persisted longer than either B. fragilis or BT, but less than
culturable fecal coliforms and enterococci (Balleste et al.,
2010). At elevated temperatures representative of summer,
persistence of qPCR and culturable cells of both B. fragilis
and BT was comparable; however, at lower, winter temperatures DNA persisted for significantly longer than the
culturable subset of the population (Balleste et al., 2010).
A strong effect of temperature was also noted by Seurinck, et al., who found that the HF183 marker persisted
for up to 24 days at 4 and 12 °C and for up to 8 days at
28 °C in fresh river water when measured by qPCR
(Seurinck et al., 2005).
The persistence of the qPCR signal of four different,
feces-derived Bacteroides MST markers (total, human,
cow and pig) was investigated at varying temperatures (4,
10, 20, and 30 °C) and salinities (0, 10, 20, and 30 ppt)
(Okabe et al., 2007). The response of different markers to
changing conditions was similar; persistence was the longest at lower temperatures and higher salinities. This
observation was attributed to the lack of or decreased
activity of eukaryotic grazers under the less favorable conditions (Okabe et al., 2007). Decay of total and fecal coliforms in the same study differed considerably;
concentrations of both groups of organisms remained largely unchanged for the first 4 days in the temperature

criteria was reduced to HF183 (TaqMan), BacH, and Pig2-Bac.
When data were considered in binary fashion, reported
sensitivity for the HF183 end-point assay was generally
higher than 80%, with specificity ranging from 92 to
100%. The SYBR Green version of the HF183 assay had
even higher sensitivity (> 87%), but specificity was lower
(> 85%; one of the participating laboratories detected the
marker in all types of nontarget host feces) (Boehm et al.,
2013). Other human-associated assays (BacHum, BsteriF1,
HF183-TaqMan, Btheta, BacH, and HumM2) exhibited
high sensitivities, but showed lower specificity (e.g. below
80%). The gyrB marker met the specificity criteria, but
had lower sensitivity (not detected in some sewage and
septage samples) while nifH did not meet either criterion.
Among the animal MST markers, CowM2, CowM3, Gull2
(SYBR format), and BacCan, all had sensitivity and specificity in excess of 80%, while Pig-2-Bac showed sufficient
sensitivity but inadequate specificity (cross-reacted with
dog and human sources).
When data were considered in a quantitative format,
among HAM BacH, Btheta, gyrB, HF183 (TaqMan), and
HumM2 showed 100% specificity, while BacHum,
BsteriF1, HF183 (SYBR Green), and nifH cross-reacted
with 7–19% of samples containing feces from nontarget
hosts (Boehm et al., 2013). In addition, nifH, Btheta,
gyrB, and HumM2 had imperfect sensitivity (i.e. < 80%),
while BacH, BacHum, BsteriF1, and HF183 (SYBR Green
and TaqMan) all passed sensitivity criteria. Overall, the
only two HAM that met both specificity and sensitivity
criteria were BacH and HF183 (TaqMan). Among animal
MST markers, CowM2, CowM3, and Gull2 (both SYBR
and TaqMan) failed to satisfy both sensitivity and specificity requirements. The BacCan assay was deemed sensitive, but it cross-reacted with samples from septage,
goose, and cow feces. Pig-2-Bac was the only animal MST
marker that satisfied both requirements. Alternative normalization schemes did not change specificity of the
assays with the exception of BacCan, which passed the
criteria when results were normalized to DNA mass (Boehm et al., 2013). While virus markers tended to be
highly specific, they were not sensitive enough under the
study conditions to detect fecal contamination in most
samples (Harwood et al., 2013).

Comparisons between decay rates of Bacteroidales DNA
(qPCR) and intact cells (assessed by binding of propidium monoazide) in marine waters indicate that sunlight
exposure has a significant effect on persistence of cells
(i.e. extended in dark compared to light-exposed treatments), but not on the persistence of DNA (Bae &
Wuertz, 2009, 2012).
The decay of qPCR signal for three Bacteroidales markers (AllBac, HF183 and BacHum) was investigated in
freshwater mesocosms inoculated with sewage (Dick
et al., 2010). The treatment variables in this particular
study included exposure to artificial sunlight, temperature
(15 and 25 °C), and predation. Reduced temperature and
predation resulted in longer persistence of targets, while
exposure to sunlight had no significant effect, which is
consistent with findings from many other studies (Kreader,
1998; Seurinck et al., 2005; Bae & Wuertz, 2009; Walters
et al., 2009; Green et al., 2011a, b; Sokolova et al., 2012).
In general, the AllBac marker persisted longer than other
targets, indicating the presence of a persistent subpopulation (Dick et al., 2010).
Other studies

The persistence of the B. thetaiotaomicron a-1,6-mannanase marker (B. theta a) through wastewater and septage
treatment (Yampara-Iquise et al., 2008) was compared to
that of E. coli and enterococci (Srinivasan et al., 2011).
BT cell equivalents were greater in sewage compared to
E. coli or enterococci, and all microorganisms were found
at similar levels in septage. All three microorganisms
showed significant differences in concentrations before
and after disinfection by chlorine (P < 0.05). However,
cultivable E. coli and enterococci showed marked reduction after disinfection, while qPCR signals from all markers exhibited much lower declines in concentration. In
sewage, regression analysis of pooled data from untreated
and treated samples showed strong correlations between
E. coli and B. theta a qPCR markers (r2 = 0.87), as well
as between enterococci and B. theta a qPCR markers
(r2 = 0.79). Similarly, septage samples showed strong correlations between B. theta a and E. coli (r2 = 0.91) and
enterococci qPCR markers (r2 = 0.92).
McQuaig, et al. tested persistence of several FIB (fecal
coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci), human-associated
MST markers (HPyV-qPCR, HF183, and M. smithii –
end-point PCR) and pathogens (Adenoviruses-end-point
PCR) over 28 days by incubating sewage at two temperatures (25 and 35 °C). Fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci persisted at significantly higher concentrations at
25 °C as compared to 35 °C, while HPyV concentrations
showed no significant decrease at either temperature until
day 21 (McQuaig et al., 2009). Adenovirus and M. smithii

trial experiments (Okabe et al., 2007). However, decay of
total coliforms, but not fecal coliforms, was considerably
enhanced at higher salinities indicating existence of a
more resistant subpopulation (Okabe et al., 2007).
Greater persistence in marine waters compared to freshwaters was noted for several Bacteroides markers (BsteriF1, BuniF2, GenBac3, HF183, HF134, and HumM2) by
qPCR (Green et al., 2011a, b). Interestingly, the general
fecal pollution marker (GenBac3) persisted longer than
the host-associated fraction indicating differential decay
profiles between the two groups (Green et al., 2011a, b).
Decay of both culturable and qPCR signals of enterococci
was assessed in the same study. While there was no
appreciable difference in enterococci decay between the
two methods, enterococci in general persisted longer than
any Bacteroides qPCR signal (Green et al., 2011a, b).
Walters et al., measured persistence of two human
(HF183, HF 184) and two ruminant (CF128 and CF193)
Bacteroidales markers by end-point PCR in freshwater
mesocosms inoculated with fresh human or cattle feces
and incubated at 13 °C (Walters & Field, 2009). In general, cow-associated markers persisted significantly longer
than their human counterparts (Walters & Field, 2009).
Exposure to light did not affect the decay of human-associated MST markers or CF193, but did increase the decay
rate of CF128 (Walters & Field, 2009). Another study also
found that sunlight exposure in freshwater matrices had
no appreciable effect on decay of human- and ruminantassociated Bacteroides markers [BacH and BacR assessed
by qPCR (Reischer et al., 2006, 2007)] (Sokolova et al.,
2012).
A similar experimental design was used to compare the
effect of light exposure on BacUni-UCD, BacHum-UCD,
BacCow-UCD, and BacCan-UCD (qPCR) markers and
enterococci (culturable and qPCR) in seawater mesocosms (Bae & Wuertz, 2009). Decay rates of host-associated Bacteroidales markers were remarkably similar,
irrespective of the marker type (i.e. target host species) or
treatment conditions (i.e. sunlight exposed vs dark), while
culturable enterococci decayed significantly more rapidly
than the corresponding qPCR signal (Bae & Wuertz,
2009). The general trend of similar persistence in light
exposed and dark mesocosms was observed for other
human-associated Bacteroides qPCR markers (Green
et al., 2011a, b). Dissenting results were reported by
Walters et al. (2009) who noted that the time required
for 90% decrease in HF183 and BacHum qPCR marker
concentrations was almost five times faster in lightexposed treatments compared to dark controls (Walters
et al., 2009). Decay of enterococci (culturable and qPCR
signal) was assessed in the same study; in general, culturable concentrations decreased significantly faster than
the corresponding qPCR signal (Walters et al., 2009).

to be the optimal sample volume, and the authors
suggest that using larger volumes also concentrates PCR
inhibitors, negating any benefit from larger sample volumes.

Selected field studies
Field studies were included in this section if they measured FIB levels or pathogens in conjunction with MST
analysis by end-point PCR or qPCR. Studies that only
include MST marker detection or quantification were
omitted with the rationale that information about correlation with regulatory parameters and/or pathogens
advances our understanding of the ultimate usefulness of
MST much more than stand-alone measurements of MST
markers.
Human-associated Bacteroidales

End-point PCR methods for human-associated Bacteroidales have been widely field tested in different matrices
and in a variety of geographic regions, for example, endpoint PCR assays for Bacteroidales including the humanassociated HF134 marker and a general Bacteroidales marker (Bernhard & Field, 2000b) were employed in a study
in British Columbia (Jokinen et al., 2010). Water samples
were analyzed for fecal coliforms and the bacterial pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli 0157:H7. The
HF134 and general Bacteroidales targets were found at all
four sites, although the general marker was more prevalent. Correlations between the HAM and the concentration of each pathogen were not evaluated; however, the
frequency of Campylobacter detection was negatively correlated with the presence of the general Bacteroidales marker as well as with fecal coliform concentrations.
Salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7 detection rates were more
strongly correlated with fecal coliform levels than with
detection of the general Bacteroidales marker.
The human-associated Bacteroides marker HF183
(Bernhard & Field, 2000b) was used in an end-point PCR
assay to assess the presence of human fecal contamination
in Lake Michigan (Bower et al., 2005). The marker was
detected in all WWTP samples collected over a 9-month
period from both urban and rural facilities, and the marker was detected in samples with E. coli concentrations
ranging from 0.2 to 82 CFU 9 100 mL 1. The marker
was detected in Lake Michigan up to 9 days following a
combined sewer overflow and was consistently detected at
sites impacted by a sanitary sewer overflow when E. coli
concentrations were > 200 CFU 9 100 mL 1. Furthermore, the marker was detected during ten sampling
events when E. coli concentrations were less than the regulatory level of 235 CFU 9 100 mL 1.

PCR signals were detected for the duration of the study
at both temperatures, while the HF183 marker persisted
for 14 and 28 days at 25 and 35 °C, respectively
(McQuaig et al., 2009).
Leskinen, et al. evaluated whether concentration of
10 liter surface water samples by hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) would improve sensitivity of detection of
three MST markers in samples from an estuarine beach
and a stream contaminated by a recent sewage main
break in Florida (Leskinen et al., 2010). HPyVs (McQuaig
et al., 2009), HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b), and the
nifH gene of M. smithii (Ufnar et al., 2006; Harwood
et al., 2009) were measured by end-point PCR in concentrated samples and 500 mL of surface water (Leskinen
et al., 2010). All three markers were detected following
HFUF in a sample from the stream collected 5 days after
the sewage spill, even though the M. smithii marker was
not detected using the standard filtration procedure.
Forty-5 days after the sewage spill, the HFUF treatment,
but not the standard filtration, allowed detection of the
M. smithii and HPyVs markers. Similar results were
reported in another study, where the M. smithii marker
was detectable for 24 days in surface waters following a
sewage leak (Ufnar et al., 2006).
Hamza, et al. investigated stability of HPyV, human
adenoviruses (HAdV), pepper mild mottle virus
(PMMoV) and TTV spiked into river water at two different temperatures (4 and 25 °C) over 21 days by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Overall, all targets
persisted longer at lower temperature, while PMMoV
decreased the least at 25 °C over 21 days (1.1 log10), followed by TTV (3.0 log10), HAdV (3.7 log10), and HPyV
(4.2 log10) (Hamza et al., 2011).
To determine the best methods by which to concentrate viruses (JC polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, and noroviruses), (Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2009) evaluated five
concentration methods using river water and spiked tap
water. Methods included filtration through glass wool
with and without prior acidification to a pH of 3.5,
ultrafiltration, electropositive filtration, and centrifugation to concentrate viral particles from 10 to 50 L of tap
water or volumes of river water ranging from 42 mL to
50 L. Glass wool filtration with preacidification and
ultrafiltration showed similar recovery efficiencies for JC
polyomavirus and adenovirus, but only the glass wool
method allowed for detection of noroviruses in tap water
samples (10 L). The glass wool concentration method
(without acidification, which was reportedly impossible
for large sample volumes) was determined to be the
most effective at concentrating viruses from larger volumes (50 L). Recovery efficiencies for all methods and
viral targets were low (< 33% recovery). When comparing different volumes of river water, 1 L was determined

Molecular methods for fecal source determination

FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

The same HF183 qPCR method (Seurinck et al., 2005)
was used to assess the source of fecal contamination in
the Santa Ana River, CA (Litton et al., 2010), which is
heavily influenced by disinfected, tertiary-treated effluent
from twelve WWTPs. Total coliform, E. coli and enterococci levels were low within the WWTP and at its discharge site and increased significantly with distance from
the discharge. By comparison, sediment concentrations of
cultured FIB were relatively constant over the sampling
sites. The HF183 marker was detected only in the Santa
Ana River, in 60% and 25% of samples from two sites.
Based on several lines of evidence, including Enterococcus
speciation, the authors concluded that enterococci were
naturalized and growing in the river sediment.
The previously mentioned study in Bangladesh (Ahmed
et al., 2010) used qPCR for HF183 to analyze water samples from 20 locations along a polluted urban lake. The
CF128 ruminant-associated marker and culturable enterococci were also measured. HF183 was found in 70% of
lake samples, generally at concentrations only 1–2 orders
of magnitude lower than raw sewage or feces, while the
ruminant marker was found in 35% of samples, including
three of the six samples that did not contain HF183. The
very high concentrations of enterococci (1.1 9 104–
1.9 9 105 CFU 9 100 mL 1) combined with a high
detection rate for the HF183 marker indicate that the lake
suffers from high levels of human fecal pollution.
The HF183 qPCR assay (Seurinck et al., 2005) was
used to investigate fecal pollution sources in a coastal
shellfish harvesting area of France that experienced high
E. coli concentrations (Gourmelon et al., 2010a). Samples
from stream and storm drain sites in urban areas and a
cattle farming area were evaluated for the HF183 marker,
general and ruminant-specific Bacteroidales markers, F+
RNA coliphage, and cultured E. coli. Positive correlations
were found between the general Bacteroidales marker and
F+ coliphage, between the general Bacteroidales marker
and E. coli, and between E. coli and F+ coliphage. HF183
was detected in all water samples from four urban sites,
and most of these samples also contained a high percentage (57–100%) of group II F+ RNA coliphage. Two other
urban sites showed lower frequency of detection of both
of these two HAM s. The ruminant-associated marker
was only detected at two urban sites:at low frequency and
concentration, but it was detected in 17% of samples
taken adjacent to the cattle farming area, while HF183
was not detected in any samples from this location.
A qPCR method for human-associated Bacteroides was
used to investigate the source of fecal pollution in streams
draining to a recreational beach in Wales (Wyer et al.,
2010). Several methods were used to evaluate changes in
water quality during a rainfall event, including hydrology
tools, a microbial tracer experiment using a specific

The end-point HF183 assay (Bernhard & Field, 2000b)
was also used to characterize fecal pollution reaching an
urban freshwater beach on Lake Ontario in Canada (Edge
et al., 2010). Suspected impacts included combined sewer
outfalls, as well as abundant gulls and Canada geese. The
most probable source of fecal contamination, which was
based on E. coli levels, the frequency of HF183 detections,
and library-dependent MST methods, varied from human
sewage near the river to bird droppings at the other end
of the beach. HF183 detection was not positively correlated with E. coli levels, but in certain cases was negatively
correlated.
Parker, et al. also used end-point PCR for the HF183
marker to assess beach contamination, but this study
focused on stormwater runoff impacting a marine beach
in North Carolina (Parker et al., 2010). Coastal sites
affected by stormwater runoff outfalls were evaluated for
HF183, a BT-like marker termed ‘fecal Bacteroides’ (Converse et al., 2009), E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and total coliforms under various flow conditions. The authors
proposed an ‘action threshold’ for fecal Bacteroides of
5000 cells X100 mL 1 that would trigger further MST
analysis. One site of three tested was frequently positive
for HF183 (44%), and these positive results were always
accompanied by high levels of fecal Bacteroides. No correlation analysis was shown.
A study conducted in the Great Lakes (Lake Michigan)
utilized end-point PCR for HF183 and measurements of
E. coli to determine pollution sources to a popular recreational beach (Kinzelman & McLellan, 2009). A stormwater outfall and other runoff were identified as the
major contributors of E. coli to the beach. Three of five
storm event samples from the outfall contained HF183;
however, the authors noted that E. coli levels in excess of
104 MPN∙100 mL 1 were associated with detection of
HF183. A bovine marker was not detected in any sample.
Several improvements were made to the beach including
retrofitting of the storm drain. E. coli concentrations in
nearshore waters of the beach decreased from a mean of
232 MPN∙100 mL 1 (2000–2004) to 76 MPN∙100 mL 1
following the remediation actions.
Human-associated Bacteroidales qPCR methods also
have been widely field-tested in different geographic areas
and matrices. In Japan, the Human-Bac1 qPCR results
showed no correlation with FIB in water samples (Okabe
et al., 2007). The HF183 qPCR method (Seurinck et al.,
2005) was field tested in Hawaii in streams and marine
waters with varying levels of sewage impact (Betancourt
& Fujioka, 2006). The marker was detected in environmental waters with enterococci and E. coli concentrations
of < 1 and 15 CFU 9 100 mL 1, respectively. HF183 was
detectable for up to 6 days by qPCR following a sewage
spill.

sites with likely human fecal contamination, though a
connection was not made between the human marker
and pathogen detection.
The HF183 marker was also used to determine the
presence of human fecal contamination at 45 stormwater
outfalls over a 4-year period (Sauer et al., 2011). Samples
positive for HF183 by end-point PCR were further analyzed by qPCR using the BacHum-UCD assay. The frequency of detection of HF183 at various stormwater
outfalls ranged from 11 to 100%. Human-associated Bacteroides gene concentrations (BacHum-UCD) were not
correlated with E. coli concentrations or with enterococci
measured by culture or qPCR, but were correlated with
E. coli measured by qPCR. High levels of enteric viruses
were measured at an outfall that also had high concentrations of the BacHum-UCD target.
Multiple targets for markers of human
fecal sources

Several MST field studies have utilized multiple assays
directed at HAMs to evaluate fecal pollution sources.
Abdelzaher, et al. explored the relationships among the
HAMs HPyVs and Ent. faecium esp gene, FIB, and several
viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens at a beach in
South Florida (Abdelzaher et al., 2010). FIB levels
exceeded recreational water-quality criteria in only one
instance in which HPyVs, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium
were also detected.
Korajkic, et al. used end-point PCR methods for HPyVs
(McQuaig et al., 2006) and the Ent. faecium esp gene
(Scott et al., 2005) to evaluate the impact of remediation
at a Florida beach (Korajkic et al., 2011). Prior to remediation, fecal coliforms and enterococci exceeded state standards in 58% and 50% of samples, respectively. The
HPyVs marker was detected in 17% of impacted beach
samples, and the esp marker was detected in 42% of samples. After sewer main repairs and removal and relocation
of beach restrooms, a significant reduction in FIB
occurred: only 7% of fecal coliforms and 11% of enterococci samples exceeded standards. The frequency of detection of the esp marker also declined to 18% of samples;
however, the HPyVs frequency of detection remained the
same. Fecal coliform levels and esp marker detection were
correlated, but no correlation was observed between FIB
and HPyVs. Salmonella spp. and enteroviruses were measured after remediation, and Coxsackie B4 virus was
detected at one site on one date. HPyVs were codetected at
this site/date, which coincided with a nearby sewage spill.
The differences in relationship between FIB and MST
markers and the codetection of an enterovirus with
HPyVs, but not esp marker, suggest that use of multiple
MST markers are helpful in interpreting field studies.

microorganism in each of four streams, several FIB, qPCR
for HF183 following the method of Stapleton et al.
(Stapleton et al., 2009), as well as general and ruminantassociated Bacteroidales qPCR assays (Layton et al., 2006;
Reischer et al., 2007). Tracer microorganism levels
released at the start of a rainfall event showed that two
streams contributed freshwater rapidly (in < 40 min) to
this location. FIB levels were highest (including fecal coliform levels above the European Directive 76/160/EEC
imperative level of 2000 CFU 9 100 mL 1) when the
microbial tracers from these two streams were most
abundant. The relative frequency of detection and concentration of general and ruminant MST markers compared to human markers led the authors to conclude that
the primary source of beach fecal pollution was cattle
from dairy farms.
Another coastal study (Boehm et al., 2009) evaluated
water quality and FIB contamination using qPCR for the
Bacteroides MST marker BacHum-UCD (Kildare et al.,
2007). F+ and somatic coliphages, enteroviruses, and
adenoviruses, and several FIB were also measured over a
72-h period in seawater at Avalon Beach in California
(Boehm et al., 2009). Adenoviruses were not detected
during the study. Coliphages were correlated with FIB,
but not with enteroviruses; however, the occurrence of
the BacHum-UCD marker was positively correlated with
enteroviruses, was negatively correlated with F+ coliphages, and was more frequently detected than F+ coliphages
or enteroviruses. The concentration of the BacHum-UCD
marker was negatively correlated with E. coli and enterococci concentrations.
Schriewer, et al. utilized the BacHum-UCD qPCR assay
(Kildare et al., 2007) to investigate the relationships
among Bacteroidales markers (human, general, dog, and
cow), FIB, and pathogens in rivers and estuaries of the
Monterey Bay region of California (Schriewer et al.,
2010). In general, the strongest correlations were found
between FIB (e.g. total coliforms and fecal coliforms);
however, human Bacteroides concentrations correlated
with total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococci concentrations. Only one significant relationship was found
between Bacteroidales markers and pathogens. Specifically,
the general Bacteroidales marker correlated with Cryptosporidium spp. using a predictive qualifier (PQ) parameter,
a weighted measure that predicts pathogen detection
relative to threshold cutoff levels of FIB or markers.
BacHum-UCD did not predict pathogen occurrence, but
general Bacteroidales and FIB showed similar PQ performance when compared for their ability to predict Vibrio
cholerae, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. This field
test illustrated a relationship between general Bacteroidales
marker detection and certain pathogens at this study
location and showed that the HAM was able to identify

Molecular methods for fecal source determination

Correlation with pathogens and risks of
waterborne illness
Epidemiology

In addition to establishing the performance of MST
methods in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and limit of
detection in ambient waters, an important next step is to
conduct epidemiological studies to determine their ability
to predict human health risks due to waterborne pathogens. Numerous epidemiological studies have assessed the
relationships among point source or nonpoint source pollution, FIB levels, and human health outcomes, and
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

recent meta-analyses provide extensive reviews of this
topic [e.g. (Wade et al., 2003; Zmirou et al., 2003)], and
more recent studies have focused on the effect of nonpoint source contamination on human health (Colford
et al., 2007; Fleisher et al., 2010; Soller et al., 2010a;
Wade et al., 2010). However, because many of the MST
methods previously described have been developed
recently, few studies to date have investigated the ability
of these methods to predict the risk of illness. Table 2
summarizes four epidemiological studies published to
date that include MST methods.
The first study was conducted at two freshwater beaches in the U.S. Great Lakes that were impacted by
WWTP effluent and combined sewer overflows (CSOs)
(Wade et al., 2006). A cohort of beachgoers were surveyed on the sampling day and in follow-up interviews
(n = 5667) to determine how rates of gastrointestinal
(GI) illness correlated with water-quality analyses, including qPCR for Enterococcus (Haugland et al., 2005) and
human Bacteroides (HF183) (Dick & Field, 2004). Results
were reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR), which represent the increase in risk of illness for each log unit
increase of FIB concentration. Enterococcus copy numbers
were significantly associated with GI illness, and the
authors also noted that the association between Enterococcus and GI illness strengthened with increased exposure
time. In contrast, no overall trend was observed with
human Bacteroides, although a nearly significant positive
association was detected at the Lake Erie beach.
A second epidemiological study took place at multiple
beaches within Mission Bay in coastal California (Colford
et al., 2007). This study attempted to determine correlations between indicators of water quality and rates of
swimming-related illnesses at a site thought to be
impacted by primarily nonhuman and nonpoint sources
of pollution. A cohort of beachgoers was surveyed on the
day of sampling and c.2 weeks later (n = 8797) to determine
rates of a number of illnesses by tracking GI, respiratory,
dermatological, and other symptoms. Human-associated
Bacteroides (HF183) was quantified via qPCR (Bernhard &
Field, 2000b; Bernhard et al., 2003), somatic and F+ coliphages were quantified, and MPN estimates of adenovirus
and norovirus concentrations were determined via reversetranscriptase PCR (Colford et al., 2005). However, of all the
measured health outcomes, only skin rash and diarrhea were
significantly more frequent in swimmers compared with
nonswimmers. For these two symptoms, there were no
correlations between rates of illness and FIB levels or rates
of detection of human Bacteroides or somatic coliphage.
Viruses were not detected often enough to determine any
relationship.
A third study was conducted (Wade et al., 2008) as a
follow-up to previous work (Wade et al., 2006) and was

Relationships among HPyVs, HF183, the nifH gene of
M. smithii, and human adenoviruses were examined at
Doheny State Beach and Avalon Beach in California
(McQuaig et al., 2012). Although the locations differ in
hydrology and potential fecal inputs, enterococci levels
exceeded regulatory standards in c. 30% of samples at
both sites. The human-associated Bacteroides HF183 marker was detected most frequently, and the M. smithii
marker was detected with low frequency at both locations. The concentration (by qPCR) and frequency (by
end-point PCR) of HPyVs were significantly higher at
Avalon Beach, while adenovirus was detected only at
Doheny Beach. The presence of adenovirus correlated
with both HPyVs concentration and HF183 detection at
Doheny Beach, which supports the utility of these markers in identifying water that poses a human health risk.
HF183 correlated weakly with FIB at both beaches, while
M. smithii correlated only with FIB at Doheny Beach.
Human MST markers and adenovirus were detected routinely in samples that met FIB regulatory standards. The
complexity of relationships among the human markers
and FIB underscores the importance of using multiple
human markers in MST field studies.
Water quality at a Florida marine beach impacted by
nonpoint source pollution was studied using several
methods for quantification of enterococci and MST
markers directed toward human, dog, and gull sources
(Shibata et al., 2010). The two human source markers
used were BacHum-UCD (Kildare et al., 2007) and
HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b). Little correlation was
noted among the FIB and MST markers with the exception of a weak relationship between BacHum-UCD and
qPCR for enterococci.
Coastal and tidally influenced creek waters in Mississippi were collected over a 2-year period and assessed for
the presence of HF183 and the M. smithii nifH gene by
end-point PCR, as well as enterococci concentrations by
membrane filtration (Flood et al., 2011). Neither HAM
correlated with enterococci concentrations.

designed to include nonenteric illnesses as well as analysis
by age group. This study was also conducted in the Great
Lakes region of the United States at beaches that were
impacted by effluent from WWTPs and CSOs. Beachgoers
were surveyed on the sampling day and in follow-up
interviews (total n = 21 015) to determine rates of illness.
Enterococcus spp. and human-associated Bacteroides
HF183 concentrations were measured via qPCR (Dick &
Field, 2004), but low sensitivity associated with the Bacteroides assay prohibited the use of these data. The incidence of GI illness was consistently correlated with
Enterococcus concentrations by qPCR, and the risk was
significantly higher among children below the age of ten.
The fourth study was conducted at a subtropical marine beach in Florida that is affected by nonpoint sources
of pollution (Sinigalliano et al., 2010). This study utilized
a prospective randomized exposure design. Adult participants were randomly grouped into bathers and nonbathers (n = 1303) and were surveyed on the day of sampling
and 7 days later to track rates of GI tract illnesses, upper
respiratory ailments, and skin illnesses. Six qPCR MST
methods were employed: two human-associated Bacteroides methods (HF183 and BacHum-UCD), two methods
to detect Enterococcus spp. (Haugland et al., 2005; Siefring
et al., 2008), one dog-associated Bacteroidales method,
and one gull-associated method to detect Catellicoccus
marimallium (Lu et al., 2008). Enterococci levels determined by membrane filtration were positively associated
with skin illness and 24 h of antecedent rainfall;
however, no other correlations were noted. According to
ª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies
Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved

a separately published epidemiological report for this
same study [the BEACHES Study, (Fleisher et al.,
2010)], GI illness, skin rash, and respiratory illness
were significantly more frequent in bathers compared to
nonbathers.
Correlation with pathogens

Some studies have offered additional insight into MST
marker effectiveness for water-quality and human health
risk assessment by correlating markers and human pathogens (see Table 3 for summary of studies in surface
waters). For example, in separate studies conducted in
California, two groups (Boehm et al., 2003; Noble et al.,
2006) analyzed the presence of human-associated Bacteroides HF183 by end-point PCR (Bernhard & Field, 2000b)
and the presence of enteroviruses via quantitative reversetranscriptase PCR in surface water samples. The study
sites were vastly different: Boehm, et al. analyzed marine
samples from Catalina Island, where flushing and dilution
of pollutants is relatively great, while Noble et al. worked
in the urban, highly impacted Ballona Creek watershed.
Boehm, et al. found relatively poor agreement between
the detection of HF183 and enteroviruses; in contrast,
Noble et al. were able to detect HF183 in nearly every
sample in which enteroviruses were detected. HF183 was
also frequently detected in the absence of enteroviruses in
many of the Ballona Creek samples (Noble et al., 2006).
In a more recent study at Avalon Beach, however, Boehm,
et al.observed a correlation between human-associated

used that included pretreatment with propidium monoazide prior to DNA extraction to limit detection to only
viable organisms (Varma et al., 2009). In this case, reductions in both of these markers were tracked through a
WWTP and found to correlate well with reductions in
infectious viruses, suggesting their utility as indicators of
pathogen presence.
Walters, et al. used seawater microcosms seeded with
sewage to further explore the relationship between persistence of MST markers and persistence of pathogens
(Walters et al., 2009). They measured persistence of the
human-associated Bacteroides markers HF183 by endpoint PCR (Bernhard & Field, 2000b) and Bac-Hum by
qPCR (Kildare et al., 2007), Enterococcus spp. via culturable and qPCR methods (Haugland et al., 2005), and
infectious enteroviruses using plaque assays and RT-PCR.
They found differential survival of Enterococcus spp., the
Bacteroidales marker, and enterovirus genetic markers,
with Bacteroidales persisting for less time than the other
two. However, in the mesocosms exposed to sunlight (as
is the case in recreational waters), the Bacteroidales markers had the most similar persistence dynamics to infectious enteroviruses (as determined by the plaque assays),
suggesting that Bacteroidales may be the best indicator of
health risks associated with enteroviruses, at least under
the conditions of their study.
The presence of human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) has
also been found to correlate with human pathogens.
McQuaig, et al. examined correlations between HPyVs,
human-associated Bacteroides HF183 (Bernhard & Field,
2000b), and adenoviruses in marine water at two beaches
in California, USA (McQuaig et al., 2012). HF183 detection and HPyVs concentration were significantly correlated with adenovirus detection at Doheny Beach, but not
at Avalon Beach. In previous work, McQuaig, et al.
analyzed correlations between concentrations of HPyVs
via qPCR and the presence of human-associated Bacteroides HF183 and human adenoviruses in a variety of samples from the human waste stream, including individual
septic tanks, septic tank pump trucks, lift stations,
WWTP influent, and WWTP effluent (McQuaig et al.,
2009). They found strong correlations between both MST
markers and the detection of adenoviruses in all samples
except for the septic tanks. In the individual septic tank
samples, both human-associated Bacteroides and HPyVs
were detected in the majority of samples, but adenoviruses were never detected. Furthermore, in 28-day laboratory
microcosms, the authors concluded that the persistence
of adenoviruses in the water was better mimicked by
HPyVs than by culture-based bacterial indicators such as
E. coli and Enterococcus spp., which both declined rapidly
even though adenoviruses were detectable for much
longer periods of time.

Bacteroides BacHum-UCD (Kildare et al., 2007) measured
by qPCR and enteroviruses (Boehm et al., 2009).
More recently, qPCR methods have been used to correlate pathogens and MST markers more precisely. In a
large study encompassing 22 tropical streams on O’ahu,
Hawai’i, Viau, et al. (Viau et al., 2011) analyzed water
samples collected during dry weather for four types of
enteric viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus GI,
and GII) and the human Bacteroides marker BacHumUCD (Kildare et al., 2007). In addition, they obtained
historical data from the same samples that were analyzed
for C. perfringens, Campylobacter, and Salmonella to
include additional pathogen data. BacHum-UCD was
positively correlated with the presence of Campylobacter
(P = 0.02), but, interestingly, a negative correlation was
found between BacHum-UCD and two of the viruses,
adenovirus and norovirus GI (P = 0.02 for each). No
other significant correlations were found. In a companion
study, a positive correlation was found between BacHumUCD and Leptospira (P = 0.004) in the same samples
(Viau & Boehm, 2011).
Savichtcheva, et al. sampled freshwater and WWTPs in
Hokkaido, Japan to determine whether the concentration
of Bacteroidales, as determined by qPCR (Okabe et al.,
2007), correlated with the presence or absence of a variety
of human pathogens, including pathogenic strains of
E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and V. cholerae (Savichtcheva
et al., 2007). In this case, human-associated Bacteroidales
markers showed significant correlations with E. coli O157:
H7, Salmonella, and enterotoxigenic E. coli. They also
concluded that culture-dependent methods for FIB enumeration were inferior predictors of pathogen presence
when compared with the MST markers.
Similarly, Walters, et al. analyzed the ability of the general Bacteroidales marker Bac32F (Bernhard & Field,
2000a), ruminant-specific markers CF128 and CF193
(Bernhard & Field, 2000b), human-specific markers
HF134 and HF183 (Bernhard & Field, 2000b), and the
pig-specific marker PF163 (Dick et al., 2005) to detect
the presence of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and
Campylobacter spp. in water samples from the Oldman
River Basin in Canada (Walters et al., 2007). The ruminant-specific markers were particularly good predictors of
E. coli O157:H7 presence, and, to a lesser extent, Salmonella. The HAMs showed a strong association with the
presence of Campylobacter (OR = 10). These results suggest not only that the markers for Bacteroidales can be
successful predictors of the presence of pathogens but
that host-specific markers may give insight into which
host-specific pathogens are most likely to be present.
In a different approach, a modification of the standard
qPCR methods for Enterococcus and Bacteroidales was

Molecular methods for fecal source determination

Animal markers
Human health risk from animal fecal contamination is
generally assumed to be less severe than from human
sources, in part because of the host-specific nature of
viruses; however, waterborne zoonotic infections caused
by pathogens shed in domestic/agricultural animal feces,
such as Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni,
Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and hepatitis E virus
still pose a definite health risk (Field & Samadpour, 2007;
Soller et al., 2010b). Recently, a quantitative microbial
FEMS Microbiol Rev 38 (2014) 1–40

risk assessment (QMRA) study estimated that under some
scenarios, cattle feces represent as great a risk to human
health as human sewage (Soller et al., 2010b). Although a
review of all MST methods directed toward animal
sources is beyond the scope of this work, here, studies
employing rapid MST methods for animal sources are
briefly reviewed and evaluated based on their sensitivity
to target fecal contamination, specificity against nontarget
contamination, limits of detection and quantification, and
field-testing results (Table S2).
Pig markers

Two TaqMan methods for pig feces (Pig-1-Bac and Pig2-Bac) target the 16S rRNA gene of porcine-associated
Bacteroidales (Mieszkin et al., 2009). Pig-1-Bac and Pig-2Bac were highly sensitive (98 and 100%, respectively) and
specific (100%). Field testing was performed using river
water samples (n = 24) from 14 sites, and markers were
detected in 25% (Pig-1-Bac) and 62.5% (Pig-2-Bac) of
samples collected around pig farms, but not in areas
influenced by cattle grazing or human fecal contamination. Concentrations of these markers ranged from 3.6 to
4.1 log10 target copies 9100 mL 1. The persistence of the
Pig-2 marker was subsequently evaluated in seawater and
freshwater microcosms (Solecki et al., 2011) in which the
marker persisted between 20 and 27 days, respectively.
Meanwhile concentrations of E. coli and enterococci
remained detectable by culture-based methods for 55 days
in both water types.
A TaqMan method targeting porcine adenovirus
(PAdV) was evaluated using pig slurries, urban and
slaughterhouse sewage, and river water (Hundesa et al.,
2009). The method showed 87% sensitivity to pooled pig
fecal samples and 100% sensitivity to slaughterhouse sewage. One hundred percent specificity was observed when
the PAdV assay was tested against both human- and
bovine-specific adenovirus serotypes. In addition, urban
sewage samples tested negative for this marker. Six river
water samples collected downstream of a pig-rearing area
were positive, suggesting that this marker may be useful
in identification of fecal contamination from swine in
environmental waters.
Dog markers

A dog marker (BacCan-UCD) and TaqMan qPCR
method were developed targeting the 16S rRNA gene
from host-associated Bacteroidales (Kildare et al., 2007).
This method was 100% sensitive toward dog fecal material and 86% specific, cross-reacting with human feces,
WWTP influent, and cat feces. In a field-validation study
in which contamination sources were blinded to the

It is important to note, however, that correlations
between MST markers and pathogens have not been
found universally. Fremaux, et al. found no correlations
between the detection of Bacteroides marker HF183 by
end-point PCR and the presence of pathogens including
Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli in Saskatchewan, Canada, using odds ratio analyses
(Fremaux et al., 2009). They did, however, find the presence of ruminant-associated Bacteroidales marker (CF128)
to be a significant predictor of the presence of Salmonella
(OR = 12.2). Similarly, the Ent. faecium esp marker (Scott
et al., 2005) was evaluated as a marker for adenovirus,
enterovirus, and rotavirus at two Great Lakes beaches
(Wong et al., 2009), but no significant correlations were
found. Interestingly, however, physical data (wind speed,
temperature, pH, turbidity, etc.) were shown to be good
predictors of pathogen presence.
As part of a method validation study, Jenkins, et al.
compared the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. to detection of the human-associated Bacteroides HF183 and
BacHum-UCD markers by qPCR in river samples from
Kenya (Jenkins et al., 2009) (see ‘Further evaluation of
methods’). Cryptosporidium was detected in 78% of water
samples, and only three of these were also positive for
human Bacteroides by either assay (two with BacHumUCD and one with HF183). A ruminant-specific marker
BacCow-UCD was codetected with Cryptosporidium spp.
in 10 of 19 samples. Ruminant and HAMs were codetected with Cryptosporidium spp. in two samples. Overall, the
ruminant-associated marker was more closely associated
with Cryptosporidium presence than the HAMs.
A recent study by Schriewer, et al. in Monterey Bay,
California also found no correlations between detection
of the BacHum-UCD Bacteroides marker (Kildare et al.,
2007) and the presence of pathogens including Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., E. coli 0157:H7, Vibrio spp.,
Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp (Schriewer et al.,
2010). They did, however, find that a general Bacteroidales marker had a comparable or better ability to predict
pathogens compared with FIB using a weighted measure
called a PQ (see ‘Selected Field Studies’ and Table S1).

Cow markers

Using the previously developed CF128 forward primer
(Bernhard & Field, 2000b), a TaqMan qPCR method specific for cow feces was developed (BacCow-UCD) (Kildare et al., 2007). This assay was 100% sensitive to cow
fecal material and showed 95% specificity, cross-reacting
with horse fecal samples. A field study in which ten water
samples were amended with varying concentrations of
target and nontarget sewage found that the concentration
of BacCow-UCD marker detected was proportional to the
amount of cow feces added. BacCow-UCD was also
detected in samples amended with horse feces, confirming
the cross-reactivity of the assay.
The BoBac TaqMan qPCR assay also targeted the 16S
rRNA gene of cattle-associated Bacteroidales (Layton
et al., 2006). This assay showed 100% sensitivity to a
small number of bovine fecal samples and cross-reacted
with only one dog fecal sample (overall specificity of
93%). Field testing was performed in rural and resort
areas that were expected to be impacted by cattle and
humans, respectively, and the BoBac assay showed that a
high proportion of fecal contamination in the rural
watershed was attributable to cattle. This assay was also
evaluated by Kildare, et al. in conjunction with the
BacCow-UCD assay (Kildare et al., 2007) where it performed comparably, showing 100% sensitivity and 97%
specificity but cross-reacted with two (25%) human fecal
samples.
Two other bovine-specific TaqMan methods were
developed based on sequences identified by metagenomic
analysis of the bacterial assemblage in cattle feces (Shanks
et al., 2006, 2008). CowM2 and CowM3 assays target
genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism
and a secretory protein, respectively. Both CowM2 and
CowM3 were ≥ 98% sensitive and 100% specific (Shanks
et al., 2008). The performance of these methods was subª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies

sequently compared with that of the BoBac qPCR method
(Shanks et al., 2010b). The CowM2 assay was detected in
seven of the eleven cattle populations tested, CowM3 was
detected in nine, and BoBac was present in every population. Both CowM2 and CowM3 showed 100% specificity
to cattle waste, while BoBac was only 47% specific.
Gull and other bird markers

The Gull-2 marker, which targets the 16S rRNA gene of
Catellicoccous marimammalium, found in gull feces, was
developed in an end-point PCR and a SYBR Green qPCR
format (Lu et al., 2008). These assays showed 71% and
74% sensitivity, respectively, to gull feces collected from
around the United States and 100% host specificity when
tested against a wide variety of individual and composite
nontarget DNA samples (Table S2). Seventy-two water
samples were collected from Canada, Ohio, and the Great
Lakes, and amplification via the Gull-2 assays was only
observed in waters expected to be impacted by gull fecal
contamination (Lu et al., 2008). No amplification was
observed in waters impacted by other species of waterfowl
or other animal sources. The Gull-2 assay was adapted to
a TaqMan format, and the marker was evaluated to determine if its presence could predict illness following exposure to subtropical, marine recreational waters; however,
no significant relationship was found between marker
concentration and human illness (Sinigalliano et al.,
2010).
SYBR Green, Gull-3, and TaqMan, Gull-4, assays targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences from Streptococcus spp.
and C. marimammalium, respectively, were developed
and tested against the Gull-2 assay (Ryu et al., 2012b).
The presence of each marker was evaluated in gull feces
(n = 255), feces from six nonavian species (n = 180), 15
other non-gull avian species, and in environmental water
samples (gull-impacted and non-gull-impacted). More
than 86% of gull feces tested positive for the Gull-2 and
Gull-4, while fewer than 30% of samples gave positive
results for Gull-3. All three assays showed low crossreactivity with nonavian feces (0.6–15%) and low to
moderate cross-reactivity with other, non-gull avian feces
(13–31%). In waters presumed to be impacted by gull
feces (n = 349), 86%, 59%, and 91% of samples were
positive for Gull-2, Gull-3, and Gull-4, respectively. In
contrast, c. 5% (Gull-2 and Gull-4) and 21% (Gull-3) of
non-gull-impacted water samples (n = 239) tested positive for these markers. Results from this study indicate
that Gull-2 and Gull-4 markers may be more conservative
indicators of gull fecal pollution (Ryu et al., 2012b).
Subtractive hybridization of gull 16S rRNA genes was
used to identify other potentially gull- or avian-specific
targets, and two SYBR green qPCR assays were developed

researchers, ten samples spiked with varying amounts of
target and nontarget fecal material were tested. Only samples amended with dog feces showed amplification with
this marker (Kildare et al., 2007). A subsequent field
study in California (Schriewer et al., 2010) suggested that
fecal contamination from dogs made up < 1% of the
total Bacteroidales load in coastal waters.
A second dog marker was developed targeting mtDNA
(NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5, ND5) that was
reported to be 100% specific against individual fecal samples (Caldwell & Levine, 2009). Sensitivity was not
directly assessed, although amplicons were reported to
have 100% identity to canine ND5 sequences via NCBI
BLAST. The marker was further tested against 24 sewage
samples, all of which were positive.

95% specific, yielding false-positive results with goose and
sewage samples. LOD was 30 gene copies per reaction.
The LA35 assay was further tested via blind sampling at a
second laboratory, which tested target (n = 13) and nontarget (n = 32) fecal DNA as well as environmental samples. The second laboratory confirmed 100% sensitivity
and specificity and saw amplification from environmental
samples only when samples were collected from waters
expected to be impacted by poultry litter.
Most recently, a marker to identify fecal pollution from
sandhill cranes (Crane1) was developed targeting the 16S
rRNA gene of unclassified Lactobacillales (Ryu et al.,
2012a). The marker showed 63% sensitivity to individual
sandhill crane samples and 95% specificity but did not
cross-react with nontarget avian samples. Field testing
was conducted at sites along the Platte River in the
Southwestern United States believed to be impacted by
crane fecal contamination, and 88% of 16 samples were
positive for the Crane1 marker. No samples collected in
the absence of abundant crane populations tested positive. The marker was further tested against 138 tropical
water samples not expected to be impacted by cranes,
and none of these samples tested positive.
Other animal markers

To assess the contribution of fecal contamination from
muskrats in Eastern Ontario Canada, a TaqMan qPCR
assay specific for this species (MuBa01) was developed
targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteroidales (Marti et al.,
2011). The marker was evaluated against a set of fecal
samples collected from wildlife, livestock, and human
sources as well as 22 water samples collected from two
sites where muskrats were observed. The marker was 66%
sensitive toward muskrat fecal samples that tested positive
for general (‘universal’) Bacteroidales by the BacUni assay
(Kildare et al., 2007) (n = 9). No cross-reactivity (100%
specificity) was observed toward all nontarget samples
tested, and all nontarget samples tested positive via the
BacUni assay. MuBa01 was detected in 2/11 water samples from one site and 1/11 from the other suggesting an
ability to detect muskrat fecal contamination in environmental waters.
mtDNA qPCR assays targeting NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 5 (ND5) and cytochrome b of cat and whitetailed deer, respectively, were developed to characterize
domestic and light industrial wastewater influents from
two municipal treatment plants in Southwestern North
Carolina (Caldwell & Levine, 2009). Markers were tested
for cross-reactivity against avian, mammalian, and piscine
feces and found to be specific; however, percent specificity and number of nontarget fecal samples were not
reported. Each marker was detected in one of 24 sewage

targeting C. marimammalium and unclassified Helicobacter spp. (GFC and GFD, respectively) (Green et al.,
2011a, b). Assays were evaluated against DNA from 635
fecal samples representing 31 host species to determine
sensitivity and specificity toward avian species and gulls,
specifically. GFC showed greater sensitivity and specificity
to gulls while GFD broadly targeted bird fecal samples.
Assays were further evaluated against environmental water
samples, and markers were detected in all waters expected
to be impacted by gulls (GFC) or birds (GFD).
Two TaqMan PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA gene
of Bacteroidales specific to Canada goose feces have also
been developed (CGOF1-Bac and CGOF2-Bac) (Fremaux
et al., 2010). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated
using raw sewage samples and fecal samples representing
17 species. Ninety-four percent of Canada goose fecal
samples tested positive for the All-Bac maker for detection of general Bacteroidales (Layton et al., 2006). Sensitivity of the markers toward individual Canada goose
fecal samples positive for All-Bac was 61% and 54% for
CGOF1-Bac and CGOF2-Bac, respectively, and 57% and
50% when all samples (including those negative for AllBac) were considered. CGOF1-Bac cross-reacted with only
one nontarget sample (pigeon) among nontarget samples
positive for All-Bac while CGOF2-Bac showed no crossreactivity toward nontarget fecal DNA giving both a specificity of > 99%. LOD for both assays was determined to
be < 10 target copies per reaction. These markers were
further field tested on freshwater samples collected from
eight sites during 3 months. CGOF1-Bac was detected in
87% of samples and CGOF2-Bac was detected in 79%.
The highest mean concentrations for both markers were
observed at sites known to be frequented by Canada
geese, suggesting the effectiveness of these markers at
identifying Canada goose fecal contamination in freshwater environments.
A Canada goose marker targeting mtDNA (NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2, ND2) was also developed and
showed 100% specificity (Caldwell & Levine, 2009). Similar to the dog marker developed in the same study (see
above), sensitivity was evaluated by NCBI BLAST analysis
and amplicons showed 100% identity to Canada goose
ND2 sequences. This marker was also detected in 29%
(n = 7) wastewater samples.
In addition to wild bird assays, a SYBR Green qPCR
assay for poultry feces and litter (LA35) has also been
developed targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Brevibacterium
avium (Weidhaas et al., 2010). The marker was validated
using fecal DNA from poultry litter samples, individual
chickens, and nontarget species including cattle, swine,
ducks, geese, and humans. The marker was detected in all
soiled poultry soils and litter and showed a sensitivity of
61% toward individual chickens. The qPCR assay was

Conclusions
A plethora of new MST assays targeting human sewage
and other animal fecal sources has been developed in
recent years, largely because of several challenges that
make finding the ‘perfect’ method elusive. These challenges may be roughly divided into the areas encompassing (1) intrinsic method performance, for example,
sensitivity and specificity toward sewage and fecal samples, including geographic range, (2) method performance
in the field (sensitivity toward dilute samples, effects of
PCR inhibition, and the efficiency of DNA recovery from
environmental matrices), and (3) knowledge about ecology of the organisms and persistence of the markers in
the environment, and correlation with FIB and pathogens
in environmental waters.
In our view, the use of multiple methods to identify
any one source is valuable because while most of the PCR
methods in use have a sensitive analytical limit of detection for the PCR itself, ranging from 1 to 10 gene copies,
each one has particular strengths and weaknesses with
regard to other issues that can limit the usefulness of
MST. For example, the most thoroughly vetted marker,
Bacteroides HF183, is not completely specific for human
waste; however, it has the advantages of being broadly
distributed among human populations and of a relatively
high concentration in sewage. The more strongly humanassociated microorganisms, such as HPyVs and pathogenic viruses, are less concentrated in sewage and are
therefore difficult to detect in dilute samples, even at levels where pathogens may be present; however, their specificity engenders great confidence in the finding of human
sewage pollution when they are detected. Better concentration methods that allow high-throughput sampling of
large volumes with quantitative recovery need to be
developed for these viral targets and others with lower
concentrations in fecal matter.
While markers exist for domestic animals such as
cattle, poultry, horses, pigs, and dogs, because of the
focus on human sources, the distribution and perforª 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies

mance of animal markers are not as well understood.
In particular, markers have not been developed for
many domestic animals that are thought to be important contributors to fecal loading in surface waters.
Even fewer markers for wild animals have been developed, in spite of the fact that many are implicated as
significant sources of fecal pollution to environmental
waters.
In addition to developing new markers and better concentration methods for diluted samples, the challenges of
implementing PCR and qPCR methods in environmental
waters are common to all the methods. Inhibition of the
PCR must be routinely assessed, and DNA purification
methods that allow quantitative recovery of DNA and
relief from inhibition must be developed. Within a geographic area and on a given day, the extent to which
PCR inhibition creates methodological problems can be
highly variable (Harwood et al., 2011), and this variability
is magnified many times over across wider geographic
ranges and different water types.
Standardization of methods and units will be important, particularly as certain methods move toward acceptance in the regulatory realm. Relatively few studies have
attempted interlaboratory studies of a given method, but
those that have (Harwood et al., 2009; Shanks et al.,
2012) emphasized the importance of standard operating
procedures and training of personnel. Details as basic as
how limits of detection and units are expressed make
comparison of method performance difficult among studies. Furthermore, the strategy for normalizing reported
gene copy numbers is not standardized and can lead to
confusion when comparing among studies, that is,
‘Should one normalize to sample volume, to DNA recovered, to some microbial value such as enterococci concentration?’
The promise of MST should not be underestimated,
even in light of the challenges outlined above. The process associated with vetting and optimizing MST methods
is common to all developing areas of scientific endeavor,
that is, one anticipates as many issues as possible and
devises strategies to circumvent them, but inevitably,
unanticipated hurdles arise that must be overcome to
move the field forward. This review has summarized the
current state of the science; however, we anticipate that
the field will rapidly evolve to surpass the capabilities presented here.

Schill, et al. developed mtDNA qPCR assays targeting
cytB from several vertebrate species, including white-tailed
deer and sheep (Schill & Mathes, 2008). The markers
were evaluated against a set of fecal samples, as well as a
mixture of cloned cytB targets from eight nontarget animal species (Schill & Mathes, 2008). In both instances,
markers exhibited 100% specificity and they correctly
identified source based on two challenge samples of fecal
matter from each animal (i.e. two white-tailed deer and
two sheep samples).
