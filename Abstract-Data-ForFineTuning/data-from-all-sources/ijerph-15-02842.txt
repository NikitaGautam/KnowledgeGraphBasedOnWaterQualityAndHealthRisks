Abstract: Fecal pollution of recreational waters can cause scenic blight and pose a threat to public
health, resulting in beach advisories and closures. Fecal indicator bacteria (total and fecal coliforms,
Escherichia coli, and enterococci), and alternative indicators of fecal pollution (Clostridium perfringens
and bacteriophages) are routinely used in the assessment of sanitary quality of recreational waters.
However, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and alternative indicators are found in the gastrointestinal
tract of humans, and many other animals and therefore are considered general indicators of fecal
pollution. As such, there is room for improvement in terms of their use for informing risk assessment
and remediation strategies. Microbial source tracking (MST) genetic markers are closely associated
with animal hosts and are used to identify fecal pollution sources. In this review, we examine
73 papers generated over 40 years that reported the relationship between at least one indicator
and one pathogen group or species. Nearly half of the reports did not include statistical analysis,
while the remainder were almost equally split between those that observed statistically significant
relationships and those that did not. Statistical significance was reported less frequently in marine
and brackish waters compared to freshwater, and the number of statistically significant relationships
was considerably higher in freshwater (p < 0.0001). Overall, significant relationships were more
commonly reported between FIB and pathogenic bacteria or protozoa, compared to pathogenic
viruses (p: 0.0022–0.0005), and this was more pronounced in freshwater compared to marine.
Statistically significant relationships were typically noted following wet weather events and at
sites known to be impacted by recent fecal pollution. Among the studies that reported frequency
of detection, FIB were detected most consistently, followed by alternative indicators. MST markers
and the three pathogen groups were detected least frequently. This trend was mirrored by reported
concentrations for each group of organisms (FIB > alternative indicators > MST markers > pathogens).
Thus, while FIB, alternative indicators, and MST markers continue to be suitable indicators of fecal
pollution, their relationship with waterborne pathogens, particularly viruses, is tenuous at best
and influenced by many different factors such as frequency of detection, variable shedding rates,
differential fate and transport characteristics, as well as a broad range of site-specific factors such
as the potential for the presence of a complex mixture of multiple sources of fecal contamination
and pathogens.

1. Introduction
Approximately 39% of the United States (US) population and more than 50% of the global
population live near a coastal area [1,2]. Coastal tourism accounts for 85% of all tourism revenue

in the US [3], with the average beachgoer spending ~$35 per beach visit [4], resulting in a massive
contribution to local economy and national gross domestic product [5,6]. During 2013, approximately
10% of US beach samples (out of total 116,230 samples collected) at 3485 beaches exceeded the US
Environmental Protection Agency beach action value (BAV) for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), indicating
unacceptable water quality [5]. Similarly, a more recent report for the European Union (EU) indicated
that ~15% of beach samples failed to meet the most stringent “excellent” quality standard at nearly
22,000 coastal beaches and inland sites across EU [7].
Because of a wide array of potential pathogens and typically low concentrations in environmental
waters, direct monitoring of waterborne pathogens can be costly, technically challenging, and in
some cases not feasible. Therefore, recreational waters are typically monitored for FIB levels instead.
Monitoring is intended to ensure that the water body is safe for human recreational contact, and the
resulting data are used to determine whether beach advisories or closures are needed. General FIB such
as total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci have been used worldwide for over a
century in sanitary assessment of recreational waters [8–12]. The type of FIB measured and values used
in recreational water guidelines vary by country [13]. Other general fecal microorganisms, such as
Clostridium perfringens and various bacteriophages, are considered alternative indicator organisms,
and are also frequently measured in various water quality monitoring programs worldwide [13–19].
However, FIB and alternative indicator organisms are common inhabitants of gastrointestinal tracts
of mammals and birds [14,20], and their detection in environmental waters provides no information
about the source of pollution. Considering that ambient waters can be influenced by multiple point
and non-point pollution sources, identification of source is crucial for any remedial efforts and risk
assessment determinations since not all fecal sources pose the same risk to human health. For example,
human fecal pollution typically presents the greatest risk because of the possible presence of human
viral pathogens, while cattle manure may be a close second because of the possible presence of zoonotic
pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. and enteropathogenic E. coli [21]. Exposure to gull, chicken,
and pig feces carries a known risk, because of possible presence of zoonotic pathogens associated
with these animals including hepatitis E virus [22], Campylobacter spp., Brucella spp., pathogenic E. coli
and Salmonella spp. [23–25]. Microbial source tracking (MST) has emerged in response to a need to
identify the source(s) of fecal pollution to better safeguard human health and aid in remediation
efforts. The majority of MST genetic markers target the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteroides spp., although
some amplify other genes and, in some instances, viral targets [13,14]. Earlier technology centered on
end-point PCR, which provides a binary, presence/absence result, but more recent studies estimate
the concentration of a given MST genetic marker via real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) [14]. Of note,
more rapid technology in lieu of molecular enrichment followed by qPCR is also being developed for
monitoring of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicator species used to monitor the
water quality in swimming pools [26].
The majority of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with recreational use of untreated
waters (e.g., lakes and oceans) are caused by pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, parasites,
and viruses, while chemicals (including toxins) accounted for approximately 6% of outbreaks with
confirmed etiology [27]. Among the pathogenic bacteria, virulent Escherichia coli serotypes (e.g.,
O157:H7), Campylobacter spp., Legionella spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Pseudomonas spp. were
most commonly identified etiologic agents [28–32]. While other protozoan species are occasionally
identified as the cause (e.g., Naegleria spp.), [27,30], Cryptosporidium spp., followed by Giardia spp.
are etiological agents for the majority of recreational waterborne outbreaks [28,29,31,32]. Regarding
viral pathogens, noroviruses and adenoviruses were most frequently identified as causative agents
in outbreaks where etiology was confirmed [27,30,32,33]. In treated waters (e.g., swimming pools
and spas), Cryptosporidium spp. are most often identified as etiological agents [30–32], although
noroviruses and adenoviruses are becoming more frequently detected [33]. It is important to note
that etiological agents in nearly 30% of outbreaks in the US alone remain unidentified [27], and that
sporadic recreational waterborne illnesses not associated with outbreaks are excluded from this report.

Even though the concepts of FIB, alternative indicators, and MST markers were developed
to indicate fecal contamination and its sources, the same paradigm is often employed to indicate
pathogen presence under the assumption that indicators consistently covary with pathogen presence.
The goals of this review are: (1) to examine reported relationships between various indicators and
pathogen species to determine the feasibility of indicators as pathogen sentinels in recreational
waters; and (2) to identify factors that affect this relationship (or lack thereof). In addition, we
also queried epidemiological studies to determine which indicator(s) most commonly correlated
with illness in recreational waters. Our search criteria mandated that each study measured at least
one indicator (FIB or alternative) or MST marker along with at least one pathogen. We focused
on studies conducted in waters intended for primary human contact (e.g., swimming, wading,

2. Relationships between Indicators and Pathogens in Recreational Waters
We queried studies conducted in marine, brackish, freshwater, and swimming pool waters
meeting our search criteria for FIB, alternative indicators, MST markers, and pathogen data. FIB levels
were typically reported as colony forming units (CFU), or most probable number (MPN), depending
whether studies measured concentrations using membrane filtration on selective-differential media or
defined substrate technology (e.g., Enterolert and Colilert), respectively (Tables 1 and 2). However,
a few studies quantified general FIB using qPCR and expressed concentrations usually as gene copies
per unit volume (Tables 1 and 2). Alternative indicators of fecal pollution such as C. perfringens
and different bacteriophages [34] were also of interest for inclusion to assess their reliability for
estimating pathogen presence compared to general FIB. C. perfringens was measured using membrane
filtration on selective-differential media with concentrations expressed as CFU per unit volume, while
bacteriophage concentrations were usually measured via single or double agar layer (SAL, DAL)
techniques, with data expressed as plaque forming units (PFU) per unit volume (Table 3).
Lastly, studies using molecular assays targeting MST markers were gathered to determine
any potential relationships with pathogenic organisms. Depending on the detection assay used,
MST data was reported as either presence/absence (end-point PCR) or as gene copies (qPCR)
per unit volume. Assays for general MST markers included those targeting 16S rRNA gene of
Bacteroidales spp. (i.e., Bac23F, GenBac3, AllBac), and pepper mild mottle viruses (PMMoV) (Table 4).
For human-associated MST markers, most assays targeted 16S rRNA or other functional genes
of Bacteroidales or Bacteroidales-like organisms (e.g., HF183, gyrB, Bfra, HF134, B. thetaiotamicron,
BacHum-UCD, B. dorei, B. uniformis, B. stericoris, HumM2, HumM19), as well as 16S rRNA of human
-associated C. coccoides, nifH gene of Methanobrevibacter smithii, and esp gene of Enterococcus faecium
(Table 4). Bovine/ruminant-associated MST markers typically target 16S rRNA genes of Bacteroidales
spp. (e.g., BacCow, CF128, and CF193) or toxin-genes of E. coli (e.g., LTIIa), while swine-associated
MST markers target Bacteroidales spp. (e.g., PF163) or E. coli (e.g., STII) (Table 4). Since pets and
waterfowl can influence water quality, dog-associated markers have been developed targeting 16S
rRNA of Bacteroidales spp. (BacCan and DogBac), as well as seagull associated markers targeting 16S
rRNA from Catelicoccus marimammalium or Bacteroides spp. (Gull) (Table 4).
We also gathered data for various bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. For bacterial
pathogens, we collected data on 10 genera (Vibrio, Salmonella, Shigella, Mycobacteria, Pseudomonas,
Escherichia, Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Legionella, and Listeria). Measurement strategies ranged from
culture-based (data reported as CFU, MPN or presence/absence) to end-point PCR (presence/absence)
and qPCR (gene copies) (Tables 1–4). For viral pathogens, we collected data on eight different species
including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, hepatitis A and E, astroviruses, rotaviruses,
reoviruses, and sapoviruses. Viral data were expressed as MPN (infectious viruses, ICC-[RT]-PCR),
presence/absence (PCR) or gene copies (qPCR) (Tables 1–4). The most frequently measured protozoan
pathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. (oo)cysts, were usually enumerated using
immunomagnetic separation, followed by staining, although in some instances, qPCR was also
performed (Tables 1–4). Enterocytozoon bieneusi was measured using similar detection methods to that
of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts (Table 2), while two pathogenic amoeba species (Acanthamoeba
spp. and Naegleria fowleri) were reported as presence/absence (i.e., PCR) (Table 1). Lastly, Candida
spp. were enumerated using membrane filtration on selective-differential media and reported as
CFU (Table 2). Sections below summarize our results regarding relationships that FIB, alternative
indicators and MST markers have with pathogens and waterborne illness occurrence in freshwater,
marine/brackish waters and swimming pools.
3. FIB and Pathogens in Freshwater
The relationships between FIB and various pathogens in freshwater, and the individual studies
from which they were derived, are summarized in Table 1. Of the 41 studies, approximately one
third (n = 18) [35–52] did not report any relationship between indicators and pathogens measured.



Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 2842

5 of 39

Of the remaining 23 studies, thirteen reported positive relationship between at least one indicator
and one pathogen [53–65], while ten did not find significant relationships [66–75]. Please see Table 1
(“relationship” and “comments” columns) for summary of relationships and other comments regarding
studies that found no significant relationship or those that did not report it.
Studies that found significant, positive relationships most commonly reported it for
Cryptosporidium/Giardia (oo)cysts and pathogenic E. coli spp., followed by Salmonella spp. and
Campylobacter spp. (Table 1). Relationships were less frequently noted for Shigella spp. and
adenoviruses, as well as non-fecal pathogens such as Legionella spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. (Table 1).
E. coli was the FIB with the greatest number of significant relationships, followed by enterococci, fecal
and total coliforms (Table 1). Significant relationships were reported between E. coli and pathogenic
E. coli spp. (n = 7), Cryptosporidium/Giardia (oo)cysts (n = 6), Salmonella spp. (n = 6), Campylobacter
spp. (n = 4), and adenoviruses (n = 2) (Table 1). Enterococci also had the greatest number of
statistically significant relationships with pathogenic E. coli spp. (n = 5), Cryptosporidium/Giardia
(oo)cysts (n = 4), Salmonella spp. (n = 3), Campylobacter spp. (n = 2), and adenoviruses (n = 1) (Table 1).
Fecal coliforms correlated with pathogenic E. coli spp. (n = 5), followed by Salmonella spp. (n = 3),
Cryptosporidium/Giardia (oo)cysts (n = 2), and Campylobacter and Shigella spp. (n = 1 each) (Table 1).
Statistically significant relationships between total coliforms and different pathogens (pathogenic
E. coli spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Legionella, and Acanthamoeba spp.) were reported only
once for each pathogen (Table 1). The methodology employed did not appear to influence the outcome,
as significant relationships were not more likely when both indicator and pathogen were measured by
a similar technique (Table 1).
The frequency of significant relationships of FIB with bacterial or protozoan pathogens was
similar; however, significant relationships with viral pathogens were less frequent (Fisher’s exact test,
p: 0.0005–0.0022). While lack of relationship between FIB and pathogenic viruses is not surprising
given the enormous differences between the two groups in terms of persistence in the environment
and low levels of viral pathogens typically found in ambient waters, correlations between FIB and
protozoan pathogens are more difficult to understand. Interestingly, when Cryptosporidium and
Giardia spp. were detected, they were generally present in higher concentrations compared to viral
pathogens. Significant relationships were reported more commonly for rivers and streams compared
to lakes [58–60,62], but this trend was not statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed
p = 0.085). Correlations appeared to be influenced by weather conditions, as most occurred during wet
seasons and/or following rainfall events [53,61,63,67,75]. Not surprisingly, correlations were also more
likely following sewage spills and/or wastewater discharges [54,56,57,61] and in waters impacted
by agricultural operations [57,61], likely due to elevated FIB concentrations, greater likelihood of
pathogen presence and the potential for location to be dominated by single fecal source.

4. FIB and Pathogens in Marine and Brackish Water
Table 2 lists general FIB and pathogen relationships reported in the datasets analyzed for marine
and brackish waters. Of the 29 studies reviewed, almost half (n = 13) did not report statistical analysis of
the relationships [52,76–87]. Within the remaining studies, ten did not find a relationship [64,70,88–95]
while six reported a positive relationship between at least one indicator and one pathogen [59,96–100].
Statistical significance was reported less frequently in marine and brackish waters compared to
freshwater (17 vs. 44) and the proportion of statistically significant relationships (compared to
non-significant) was considerably higher in freshwater (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001). Please see
Table 2 (“relationship” and “comments” columns) for a summary of relationships and other comments
regarding studies that found no significant relationship or those that did not report it.
Significant relationships with FIB were most commonly reported for Salmonella spp., followed
by adenoviruses, and Campylobacter spp., Vibrio spp., S. aureus, and protozoan pathogens (Table 2).
The most significant relationships with pathogens were reported for enterococci (n = 11), followed
by E. coli (n = 4), and fecal coliforms (n = 2). No statistically significant relationships were reported
for total coliforms. Significant relationships were reported between enterococci and adenoviruses
(n = 8), Salmonella spp. (n = 4), Cryptosporidium/Giardia (oo)cysts (n = 4), Campylobacter spp. (n = 3), and
Candida spp., Vibrio spp., S. aureus, noroviruses, and E. bieneusi (one observation each) (Table 2). E. coli
formed significant relationships with Salmonella spp. and Vibrio spp. (n = 1 each) and adenoviruses
(n = 2). Statistically significant relationships with fecal coliforms were reported only for adenoviruses
(28.6%, n = 7). The methodology employed did not appear to influence the outcome; significant
relationships were not more likely when both indicator and pathogen were measured by a similar
technique (Table 2).
As expected, FIB had more significant relationships with bacterial pathogens compared to viral
pathogens (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.0069), but there was no significant difference in other comparisons (i.e.,
FIB relationships with bacterial compared to protozoan pathogens, or FIB relationships with protozoan
compared to viral pathogens). Of note, FIB most likely to correlate with pathogens were enterococci,
which supports its recommended use to monitor marine recreational water quality. No clear trend for
different marine water types (e.g., brackish waters and coastal beaches) was observed with respect to
statistically significant indicator/pathogen relationships [59,96,98–101], suggesting that hydrological
factors play less of a role compared to freshwaters. Similar to freshwater, the common trend among
the studies reporting significant relationships was that they were conducted in waters impacted by
fecal contamination [96,98,99], and when bather numbers were high [97], conditions likely to result in
elevated FIB and pathogen levels.

5. Alternative Indicators and Pathogens in Marine, Brackish and Freshwater
Ten studies conducted in freshwater and fourteen studies conducted in brackish and marine
waters measured at least one alternative indicator and one pathogen. In freshwater, four studies
measured C. perfringens, five studies measured bacteriophage, and one study measured both (Table 3).
In brackish/marine waters, the majority (n = 12) of studies measured coliphage (somatic, F-specific),
followed by C. perfringens (n = 7), and phages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 1) (Table 3).
Similar to FIB, more statistically significant relationships were reported in freshwater compared
to brackish/marine waters (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0057). Please see Table 3 (“relationship” and
“comments” columns) for summary of relationships and other comments regarding studies that found
no significant relationship or those that did not report it.
In freshwater, half of studies (n = 5) did not report statistical analysis [41,45,47,49,102], four
reported at least one statistically significant relationship [54,63,64,103], while a single study reported a
non-significant relationship [39] (Table 3). Statistically significant relationships were reported more
frequently for C. perfringens, followed by F-specific and somatic coliphages (Table 3). C. perfringens
had positive relationships with Campylobacter spp. (n = 2), and Listeria spp., Salmonella spp. and
pathogenic E. coli spp. (one observation each). F-specific coliphage correlated with noroviruses,
Cryptosporidium/Giardia (oo)cysts, and Campylobacter spp. (one observation each) while somatic
coliphage correlated only with adenoviruses (n = 2). Similar to FIB, the observed correlations occurred
in waters affected by sewage discharge [54], following rainfall events [103], and were affected by
season and sampling site [63].
In marine and brackish waters, approximately, half of studies (n = 6) did not report any statistical
analysis [76,77,81,82,87,89], while three reported statistically significant relationships [79,90,100], and
five reported non-significant relationships [64,88,91,92,94]. Two studies found significant relationships
between F-specific coliphage and pathogens; one reported it with methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA),
and S. aureus at a marine beach affected by fecal-impacted freshwater intrusion [79], while a second
reported it for adenoviruses in water impacted by urban run-off [90] (Table 3). No studies noted
a significant relationship between somatic coliphage and pathogens (Table 3). Only a single study
conducted in Hawaii [100], a state that recommends using C. perfringens for monitoring ambient
waters [104], found a relationship between this indicator, and two pathogens (Campylobacter spp., and
V. parahaemolyticus) (Table 3). The methodology employed did not appear to influence the outcome in
marine or freshwaters; significant relationships were not more likely when both indicator and pathogen
were measured by a similar technique (Table 3). While there were insufficient data to perform statistical
analyses regarding relationship of alternative indicators and different pathogen groups, F-specific
coliphage tended to perform better compared to somatic coliphage and C. perfringens.

6. MST Markers and Pathogens in Marine, Brackish and Freshwater
The number of studies that measured MST marker(s) along with at least one pathogen is
considerably smaller (n = 19; eight in freshwater, and 11 in brackish/marine/waters) compared
to studies measuring FIB or alternative indicators (Table 4). The majority of MST measurements
reported were for human-associated marker(s) (76.1%), followed by general MST markers (7.0%),
cattle and dog associated MST markers (5.6%), and seagull and swine-associated MST markers
(2.8%) (Table 4). Most frequently measured pathogens were viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus,
noroviruses, hepatitis, and infectious enteric viruses) and bacteria (E. coli, Campylobacter spp.,
Salmonella spp., V. vulnificus, S. aureus, and Legionella spp.) with 22 measurements each, while
Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts were reported less frequently (n = 6) (Table 4). Irrespective
of the water type, nine of these studies did not report statistical analyses for relationships between MST
marker(s) and pathogens [51,76,77,79,80,83,86,88,105], and another seven reported non-significant
relationship [48,56,57,70,72,98,99]. The remaining two studies reported statistically significant
relationship [93,106] (Table 4). Please see Table 4 (“relationship” and “comments” columns) for
summary of relationships and other comments regarding studies that found no significant relationship
or those that did not report it.
Significant relationships between pathogens and human-associated MST markers were reported
for HF183 and adenoviruses, at a marine beach impacted by non-point source(s) [93], and between
HF183/HF134 and Campylobacter spp. in freshwater affected by livestock operations [106]. In the
same freshwater study, cattle-associated MST markers (CF128, CF193) correlated with E. coli O157:H7,
and Salmonella spp., while a general Bacteroidales MST marker (Bac32F) correlated with all three
pathogens [106]. The methodology employed did not appear to influence the outcome; in other words,
significant relationships were not more likely when both indicator and pathogen were measured by a
similar technique (Table 4). There were insufficient data regarding relationship of MST markers and
different pathogen groups (e.g., bacterial, viral and protozoan) to perform statistical analyses. While
it may seem counter-intuitive that MST markers (particularly human-associated subset), were not
generally correlated with pathogens, it is important to note that sensitivity and specificity of MST
markers varies greatly [14]. Furthermore, many pathogens reported in these studies are zoonotic,
making this relationship even more tenuous.

Correlations between observed illness in these studies were most common with enterococci
(10 studies out of 17) [79,86,110,111,113,114,116,117,120,121], followed by F+ coliphage
(5 studies) [79,113,118,119,123] (Figure 2), suggesting that these two indicators may be better
predictors of waterborne illness occurrence. Fecal coliforms, human-associated MST markers (Bsteri,
BuniF2, and HF134), general MST marker (GenBac3), culturable E. coli, total coliforms, and somatic
coliphage were correlated with illness less frequently (Figure 2). Twenty-seven indicator measurements
across all studies were correlated with human illness, and 93% of these studies were conducted in
waters with known point or non-point source contamination, contaminated surface/ground water flow
or following wet weather events. Only six studies [79,86,117–119,124], all of which found relationship
between indicator and illness, measured pathogens, in addition to recording illness information, and
indicator organism concentrations. Only one of the six studies found a relationship between pathogens
and illness or indicator concentrations. This is not surprising since, in these studies, pathogens were
detected infrequently and at low concentrations. This illustrates the potential challenges of detecting
relationships between indicators and pathogens in the field even when health relationships were
observed with fecal indictors.
9. Factors that Influence Indicator and Pathogen Relationships
Most recreational waters at any given time are impacted by many different sources of fecal
contamination (e.g., treated and untreated wastewater, agricultural operations, stormwater, and
domestic and wildlife animals) and these influences can change depending on many different factors
including precipitation, tidal flow and wind direction. In addition, each fecal source has its own set
of indicators and the potential for different types of pathogens. Therefore, the more fecal sources
a recreational water is impacted by, the more challenging it will be to show correlations between
indicators and pathogens. Preceding sections described our findings regarding relationships between
indicators and pathogens in recreational waters, as well as relationships between indicators and illness.
Overall, FIB were better predictors of bacterial and protozoan pathogen presence (compared to viral),
relationships were more probable under scenarios where both indicator and pathogen were likely
to be present at higher concentrations, and enterococci and F-specific coliphage tended to be better
predictors of waterborne illness occurrence compared to other indicators. The following sections
examine various factors that are likely to influence the observed trends.
10. Detection Frequency and Concentrations of Indicators and Pathogens in Marine, Brackish
and Freshwaters
The observed relationships between indicators and pathogens can be influenced by logistical
factors that may confound determination of actual relationships, including study design and
methodological limitations. Study design determines the frequency at which a target (FIB, alternative
indicator, MST marker or pathogen) was measured (per study or cumulative multiple studies),
while methodology employed influences likelihood of detection. We compiled studies that reported
frequency of detection (or data that allowed calculation of frequency detection such as total number
of samples and samples positive) for at least one FIB/alternative indicator/MST marker and at least
one pathogen per sample(s), resulting in inclusion of 49 studies (Table 5). Microbial data collected
were first grouped according to indicator (FIB, alternative or MST) or pathogen type (bacterial, viral
or protozoan), and further organized according to the detection format employed (different types
of culture-based or molecular). Table 5 describes the detection frequency (per study and per total
cumulative samples) for microorganism targets (FIB, alternative indicators, MST, and pathogens) for
both freshwater and brackish/marine waters.

Each FIB was detected at least once in 100% of studies, which was true for most of the microbial
targets. General FIB were also the most frequently detected on a per sample basis, as they were found
in 94.2% of samples across 13,823 measurements in marine and freshwaters (Table 5). In freshwater,
detection frequency of FIB per sample was 95% across 11,920 measurements and it was somewhat
lower in brackish/marine waters (93% across 2203 measurements) (Table 5). Detection frequency
of alternative indicators per sample, irrespective of the water type, was considerably less than FIB,
averaging 60.6% (across 2606 measurements); the difference between water types was also more
pronounced than for FIB (freshwater detection frequency 83.7%/2366 measurements vs. marine
45.1%/240 samples) (Table 5). While the 2705 samples analyzed for MST markers in marine and
freshwaters were similar to alternative indicators, the overall detection frequency average (42.9%) was
considerably lower (Table 5). The frequency of detection and total number of samples collected in each
water type (37.4%/1355 in freshwater vs. 47.3%/1350 in marine water) was similar (Table 5).
Irrespective of the water type, bacterial pathogens were measured more often (9280 total samples),
compared to viral (3462) and protozoan (3400) pathogens, although the frequency of detection across
different pathogen groups was similar (33.8%, bacterial; 29.6%, viral; and 28.9%, protozoan (Table 5)).
There also appeared to be no appreciable difference in detection frequency between the water types for
any of the pathogen groups, although considerably more samples were collected in freshwater (Table 5).
For bacterial pathogens, frequency of detection across 8936 total samples collected in freshwater was
35.2%, compared to 30.3% in 344 marine/brackish water samples (Table 5). Similarly, viral pathogens
were detected in 33.1% freshwater samples (out of 2952) and 23.6% of 510 marine water samples
(Table 5). Lastly, protozoan pathogens were detected in 34.6% of 3,134 freshwater samples and 24.4%
of 266 marine water samples (Table 5).

A subset of studies examined (n = 33) reported concentration data in the body of the manuscript,
tables or supplemental materials, allowing graphs to be created displaying average densities per
organism and water type (Figures 3 and 4). Concentrations of indicators were on average 1–3 log10
higher than pathogen concentrations for both water types. Both indicators and pathogens in marine
waters were found at slightly lower levels (0.5–1 log10 ) than those observed in freshwater (Figures 3
and 4 and Table 6). Within an indicator group, concentrations of FIB ranged from not detected
(ND (observed only for enterococci)) to 5.39 log10 per 100 mL (Table 6), and total coliform levels
were the highest, followed by fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci (Figures 3 and 4). Alternative
indicator concentrations were lower than FIB (ranging from ND–3.29 log10 per 100 mL (Table 6)),
and C. perfringens levels were higher than somatic and F-specific coliphage (Figures 3 and 4).
MST marker concentrations were reported less frequently and were more variable, ranging from
ND–2.50 log10 copies per 100 mL (Table 6 and Figures 3 and 4). Bacterial pathogen concentrations

As evidenced by the examples above, readily detected microorganisms are more likely to be
measured and frequency of detection of a given microorganism is influenced by the concentration and
distribution of the target in the sample types tested, as well as the limit of detection of the method used.
Culture methods such as membrane filtration can have a low limit of detection, e.g., 1 CFU/100 mL,
and can reliably detect FIB in water samples with minimal contamination. Conversely, pathogens are
generally present sporadically and in lower levels than fecal indicators. These types of targets require
high-throughput filtration methods that can achieve large concentration factors, with the tradeoff that
limits of detection are generally quite high. In addition, the volumes sampled, and the concentration

strategy used can vary between studies and can affect the sensitivity of a given method. These logistical
factors frequently result in unbalanced comparisons in which the indicator organism is frequently
detected, but the pathogen is not. Therefore, the disconnect between indicators and pathogens may
not be due to a true lack of relationship in many cases, but to methodology that is much more suited to
detecting indicators than pathogens.
11. Microbial Levels in Fecal Material
The observed relationships between indicators and pathogens can also be affected by factors
intrinsic to the organisms themselves, including levels in various hosts, as well as shedding frequencies
and duration. FIB are commensal inhabitants of the GI tract of humans and other animals and as such
are shed continually in feces. Levels of fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci typically found in human
feces range 105 –109 CFU per gram [13], while levels detected in untreated wastewater are somewhat
lower (105 –108 CFU per 100 mL) [13,128]. The concentration of FIB in animal excreta is lower still,
ranging from 104 to 107 CFU per gram, depending on the animal host [13]. Alternative indicators are
also commensal organisms of the GI tract but are typically found in lower concentrations and are more
influenced by diets and physiologies of the host [13,14,128]. For example, C. perfringens levels in animal
and human feces range from undetectable to 108 CFU per gram [13], while coliphages were absent
from some animal feces and primary wastewater effluents [128,129] and typically did not exceed
~103 PFU/mL of untreated wastewater [128]. MST markers target different fecal microorganisms
that are strongly associated with particular hosts [14] and the human-associated subset is reported
to range from 103 to 1010 gene copies per gram of feces or 100 mL of untreated wastewater, while
animal-associated MST markers range from 104 –109 gene copies per gram of feces depending on the
sensitivity of individual markers and geographic region [13].
Pathogens may cause symptomatic or asymptomatic infection of their human and animal hosts.
Shedding rates can vary widely, although levels found in the wastewater are typically several orders
of magnitude lower than any indicator species [128,130–133] likely due to the sporadic nature of
pathogen occurrence and detection compared to indicators. Additionally, only a small part of the
population is infected with pathogens at any given time, resulting in considerable variation in the
levels of pathogens, particularly when originating from relatively small populations. Differential
shedding of pathogens from infected hosts is also contributing to the occurrence of pathogens in
recreational waters. For example, shedding rates for human viral pathogens can be as high as 1011
viral particles per gram of feces in the case of adenoviruses [134], while shedding rates of bacterial
pathogens are typically lower [133], as cattle excreting >104 CFU per gram of feces E. coli O157:H7
are considered to be “super-shedders” [135]. Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cyst shedding rates by
the infected individuals can range from 106 to 1011 per gram of feces [132] and are typically higher
in animal hosts compared to human [131,136], although not all (oo)cysts excreted by animals are
zoonotic [131,137].
Shedding duration of viruses can vary from weeks to months [133], and some viruses display
distinct seasonal trends (e.g., infectious enteroviruses are more prevalent in wastewater in summer
and early fall) [134]. Similar to pathogenic viruses, excretion of (oo)cysts is typically long term [132].
Shedding duration of bacterial pathogens is shorter with median values typically reported to be
~2 weeks, although in some instances it can last considerably longer [138,139]. Similar to viral
and protozoan pathogens, shedding is affected by many different factors including diet and age of
the host [140,141], temperature [140], as well as composition of gut microbiome [142]. Infectious
dose of different pathogens is also variable and typically the lowest for viruses [134,143], medium
range for protozoan pathogens and generally highest for bacterial pathogens [143], although E. coli
O157:H7, with a low infectious dose, is an exception [144]. The infectious dose of viral, bacterial and
protozoan pathogens is dependent on many factors, including individual strains and health status of
the host [134,143].

12. Susceptibility to Environmental Stressors
While wastewater treatment processes generally result in some removal of indicators and
pathogens [128,145], sanitary sewer and combined sewer overflows, along with other infrastructure
failures can result in release of indicators and pathogens into ambient waters. In addition, different
indicator and pathogen groups exhibit variable susceptibilities to disinfection strategies. Bacteria
are generally susceptible to chlorination and UV treatment [146]. Protozoa and viruses are typically
most susceptible to UV treatment [146,147], with the notable exception of adenoviruses [148]. Once
indicators and pathogens are released into ambient waters, a new panoply of biotic and abiotic
environmental factors affects fate and transport characteristics, including ambient sunlight, indigenous
microbiota (i.e., predation and competition interactions), temperature, salinity, nutrient levels, location
(water column vs. sediment), source of fecal pollution and resilience of individual organisms.
Ambient sunlight and associated UV radiation typically act to increase the decay rates, although
the magnitude of this effect is influenced by the environmental conditions [149] and measurement
strategies [150,151]. For example, viable cells and culturable/infectious organisms typically display
the effects of UV damage more readily than their corresponding nucleic acids. Interactions with
indigenous microbiota also increase decay rates, although this was predominantly shown for FIB, MST
markers and some bacterial pathogens, (e.g., [152–155]) with inconclusive data for other organisms
(e.g., various bacteriophages and C. parvum [156,157]). Influx of nutrients (in the form of organic carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus) can result in extended persistence [158–160], and potentially mitigate the
effects of biotic interactions [161] but this assertion was not tested in detail for organisms other
than culturable FIB. Temperature and location affect decay rates of most organisms tested (e.g., FIB,
bacteriophage, viral pathogens, MST markers) almost unilaterally with greater persistence at lower
temperatures [150,162–166] and in the sediments and sands compared to the water column (recently
reviewed in [167]).
Similar to the effect of ambient sunlight, salinity (and the associated ionic content of brackish
and marine waters) affected the decay rates of culturable/infectious FIB, alternative indicators, MST
markers and pathogens more so than their corresponding nucleic acids [168–174]. The effect of
source of fecal pollution has been studied on FIB and MST markers, and indicators originating from
ruminants are more persistent compared to those from other fecal sources (e.g., dog, seagull, and
human) [169,175–179], although different human sources (e.g., feces, septage, and sewage) elicit
different decay rates [152]; analogous information for alternative indicators and pathogens is still
missing. Finally, studies that compared decay of various indicators to pathogens directly under the
same experimental conditions are rare and report conflicting results. For instance, in one study, E. coli
O157:H7 persisted longer than FIB (e.g., E. coli and enterococci) in freshwater [180], but another group
reported similar trend in the freshwater sediments but not the water column [181]. Another group
reported no difference in decay between FIB, various MST markers and C. jejuni, S. enterica and
adenovirus in freshwater [151]. Others reported considerably faster decay of C. jejuni (but not C. coli or
Salmonella spp.) than FIB and MST markers, irrespective of the water type [171]. As exemplified above,
variable responses of different indicator and pathogen groups to these stressors and the resulting
differential decay rates further confound the indicator paradigm.
13. Conclusions
FIB and alternative indicator organisms (C. perfringens and coliphages) have been used for over a
century, and continue to be used today as indicators of general fecal pollution in many applications,
including the assessment of sanitary quality of recreational waters [8]. MST markers are used to
identify source(s) of fecal pollution and are a more recent addition to the monitoring toolbox available
to water quality managers and other practitioners in the field [14]. The goal of this review is to
two-fold. Our primary objective was to examine reported relationships between various indicators
and pathogens in recreational waters to determine the value of different indicators as surrogates for

pathogen presence. Secondly, we aimed to more closely inspect different factors that may have an
impact on this relationship.
The majority of the studies either did not report a relationship, or they reported a statistically
non-significant relationship. Among the studies that observed statistically significant relationships,
it was considerably more common in freshwater compared to marine waters. General FIB tended to
form statistically significant relationships more commonly with bacterial and protozoan pathogens,
(compared to viral pathogens) and this difference was statistically significant. Alternative indicators
and MST markers correlated with pathogens less frequently, although it occurred more in freshwater
than marine/brackish waters. Overall, statistically significant relationships were detected more
frequently in waters known to be impacted by fecal pollution and following wet weather events, both
scenarios under which indicators and pathogens are more likely to be co-detected.
Among factors influencing these relationships frequency of detection and variable concentrations
of indicators and pathogens were identified as major contributing factor. Not surprisingly, general FIB
were measured and detected more frequently than any other indicator or pathogen (generally in >90%
of samples) and were also reported at higher concentrations, irrespective of the water type. Alternative
indicators were also frequently detected in samples (>70%), while MST markers were measured and
detected less frequently, and in lower concentrations than FIB or alternative markers (frequently in
<10% of samples). Pathogen detection frequencies were similarly low. Low frequency of detection
affects the ability to establish relationships between the frequently-detected and infrequently-detected
analytes, as the dataset becomes left-censored (biased toward non-detects values). What looks like
“absence” is frequently an artifact of comparing an analyte with high density (e.g., FIB) with one of
low density (e.g., pathogen). Better concentration and recovery methods for the infrequently-detected
analytes may provide a more realistic picture of the relationships among these various microorganisms
in environmental waters. Finally, concentrations in feces and wastewater, shedding rates and patterns
of various indicator and pathogen groups differ, as do their fate and transport characteristics in
secondary habitats. Indicators are typically present in higher concentrations than any of the pathogen
groups, and are also shed constantly, or more frequently, compared to pathogens. Upon entry into the
secondary habitats, a host of biotic and abiotic factors differentially affects persistence of indicators and
pathogens, further confounding the indicator–pathogen paradigm. Lastly, another important factor
impacting the ability to establish relationships between indicators and pathogens is the realization
that most locations are impacted by multiple sources of fecal contamination. Although it is difficult to
measure the impact of multiple fecal inputs, tools such as sanitary surveys and GIS mapping have
the ability to indicate potential point and non-point sources of fecal pollution and future MST studies
should improve our understanding of the impacts of multiple fecal sources.
To further our understanding of indicator and pathogen relationships, future studies measuring
these microorganisms in recreational waters should evaluate and report the existence (or lack thereof)
of such relationships. Other considerations include careful selection of targeted pathogens and
methodology used to quantify them. Furthermore, providing the data on a per sample basis (rather
than descriptive statistics of a dataset) in at least supplementary materials, will enable metanalyses,
which may yield a more robust estimate of a true state of indicator/pathogen paradigm. Lastly,
while standardized and sensitive methods exist for FIB detection and enumeration in recreational
waters, analogous procedures for alternative indicators, MST markers and pathogens are still missing.
Standardization of detection and quantification methods suitable for each indicator/pathogen group
can enable more accurate evaluation of any statistically significant relationships between these
two groups.
