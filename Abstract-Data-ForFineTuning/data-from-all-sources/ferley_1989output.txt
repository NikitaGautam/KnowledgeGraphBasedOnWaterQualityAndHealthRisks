STANDARD S FOR RECREATIONALWATERS

The sununer camps were chosen from among more
than 30 family or children's holiday camps scattered
along the Ard'eche river and its tributaries in order to
gather population samplesexposed to various qualities
of bathing water. The weekly bacteriological water
surveillancewasdoneaccordingto the recreationalwater
-regulations.9-10
A pilot study undertaken the previous
year with weekly samples from five beaches and a
comprehensive bacteriological and physicochemical
study conducted in 198411
provided good information
aboutthe usual river bacteriologicalquality: t~ beaches
had 'poor' water quality, two others were exposed to
bacteriological contamination considered as 'intermediate'and the fifth was 'fairly good' (seethe foll(7,Ving
definitions).
Individuals and families usually stayin holiday camps
for one week or more, neverless. Inclusion into the study
was dependentupon their having remainedthere at least
three days beforethe interview. Interviewers visited the
camps every day but interviewed a given family only
once during their stay. While the study beacheswere
limited, tourists were free to choose any beach in the
Ard'echebasin. Therefore,they were askedwhether they
swam or not for each day during the (maximum) eight
days of the observation period, and where they did so;
those who had bathed elsewhere than at the
study beaches (including swimming pools) were
excluded for the three days following that bathing
episode.
Morbidity ascertainmentduring the observationperiod
was basedon the interviews and included five categories
of illness: (i) acutegastrointestinaldiseases;(ii) skin and
mucous membrane diseases; (iii) ear, nose and throat
(ENT) disease~; (iv) eye diseases; (v) pulmonary
diseases.Day of onsetand duration were recordedalong
with any fever(self-assessed
or measuredwith a thermometer). While severalillnesses could have occurred in
one individual, only those which were separatedby at
least two days of remission were considered as
independent,if they pertainedto the samecategory.The
foll(7,Vingresultswill be restrictedto the first occurrence
of an illness in the case of multiple attacks.
Data were also collected on possible confounderssuch
as where individuals took meals (self-prepared or in
camp dining rooms) and drinking water consumption.

by the local health authorities in each camp during the
study period. The study design is detailed. further
elsewhere.23
The bacteriological investigations were conductedas
follows: every Monday, five water samples were taken
at each beach, from one side of the river to the other,
the two extreme samplesbeing taken at two metres from

the river bank. On Thursday,one'watersamplewas taken
in the middle of the river (swimmers oftencross the river
which varies from 10to 40 m wide at different study
beaches).All the sampleswere taken at a depth of about
30 centimetres; the time of sampling wasbetween 11am
and 4 pm. The bacterial count was performed by
MICROMER Laboratory 12 using the following
techniques: (i) 'total coliforms': spread plate or
membrane filter procedureusing Tergitol and roc agar
(Diagnostics Pasteur)incubated at 37°+/-1°C for 24
hours; (ii) 'faecal coliforms': sametechnique as (i) but
incubated at 44.5°+/-loC for 24 hours; (iii) 'faecal
streptococci': pour-plate technique using D. coccosel
agar(bio Merieux Productions)incubatedat 37°+/-loC
for 24 hours; (iv) Aeromonas Spp: Pril-Xylose
Ampicillin agar13.l4
incubated at 37°+/-1°C for 48
hours; (v) Pseudomonasaeruginosa: Cetrimide and
nalidixic acid agar (Institut Pasteur Productions)
incubated at 42°+/-loC for n hours. IS

Exposure Assessment
The issue of multiple exposuresis important here. An
individual is likely to havevisited severalstudy beaches
during the observationperiod (not to mention the nonstudy beaches,discussedabove); the quality of a given
beach may also vary with time. It is therefore difficult
to relate exactly any eventual morbidity to a given
exposure.To achievea reasonableexposureassessment,
two hypotheseswere used for (i) the time period representedby one watersample; (ii) the latencyof morbidity.
Moreover, severalanalytical approacheswere used to
generate a kind of sensitivity analysis regarding the
validity of these hypotheses.
Only two watersampleswere available eachweek for
each beach, ie Mondays and Thursdays (mainly for
financial reasons). It was assumed that the quality
assessmentprovided by one water sample was a valid
representationof the water quality during the three-day
period centred on the sampling day. For the analytical
approach developed in this paper (but not for all the
approaches tested), Saturdaywas considered as a day
for which water quality was unknown becauseit did not
belong to either one of two successivethree-dayperiods
(as if a tourist had bathed on a non-study beach), and
t.'1erefore,discarded.
The maximum latency for the five illness categories
was assumedto be three days. Thus, one case could be
related to a given exposure only if the symptoms had
occurred the same day,or in the following two days. As
before, this assumptionwas necessary for the type of
analysis that will be presented later, but not for all the
approachestested.

swimmers and the following focuseson these two types
of morbidity.
Table 2 presentssome demographiccharacteristicsof
the exposedand unexposedpopulations, showing some
discrepancies with regard to age (swimmers are, on
average, younger than non-swimmers) and sex (more
females do not bathe than males). The durations of stay
in the camps before interviews are similar in the two
groups.
Bacteriological quality of the study beaches is
described in Table 3, which groups the five beachesinto
three categories according to the two indicator bacteria
currently used to describe the water quality in the
European Community (total colifonns and faecal
colifomlS).K! It appearsthat some discrepanciesexist in
the classification of the beaches when using the
conventional indicators on the one hand, and faecal
streptococci and the two study pathogens on the other
hand; in particular with faecal streptococci,differences
between beachesare weaker and the order is altered.
Table 4 compares the gastrointestinal and skin
infection morbidity according to the three categoriesof
beaches.The referencepopulationof non-bathersgroups
all non-exposed individuals from all beachesbecause
of sample sizerequirements.For gastrointestinaldisease,

the leastpolluted beachesdiffer markedly from the two
other categories,with a shift in the magnitudeof the risk
related to swimming, which is close to that observed
among non-swimmers for gastrointestinal morbidity.
Skin diseaseincidence rates follow a more progressive
and consistenttrend betweenthe three beachcategories.
The correlations between each bacterial count and
general, acutegastrointestinal morbidity or skin disease
among swimmers have been studied using weighted
linear regression models. The results are summarized
in Table 5. Faecal streptococci show a much better
relationshipwith AGID (and more specifically 'objective'
AGill) than both coliform indicators; it is not a predictor
of skin diseases.On the other hand, fuecalcoliforms best
indicate general morbidity and skin disease risks.
Although it is not excellent, the assumptionof linearity
is in reasonable agreement with the data for faecal
streptococciandAGill, and for fuecal coliforms and skin
diseases.The paradoxical relationship betweenpathogen
concentrations and gastrointestinal morbidity remains
unexplained. Similarly the true natureof the correlation
between skin diseaseincidence rate and the concentration of aeromonas and pseudomonas germs is
questionable.19.20
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate these results for faecal
coliforms and fuecal streptococci. The regression95%
confidence intervals are plotted along with the straight
line which representsthe incidence rate of 'objective'
AGill occurring to non-swimmers (and its 95%
confidence interval). Equivalent figures showing the
relationship between total AGill and FS or FC, and
betweenskin diseasesand FC are availableupon request.

270/100rn1and 800/I00ml. However, this risk-level
estimation for FC is more imprecise becauseof a poor

concentration of indicator bacteria such. as 'faecal
coliforms' 'E. coli' and 'enterococci'.3-4This general
featurewasalso found in our study for faecal streptococci
and both coliform indicators for the general morbidity
rate but the linearity of the relationship betweenAGID
and the coliform concentrations was not good.
Interestingly,this holds true for the relationship between
faecal coliform concentrationand skin diseaseincidence
rate. Given the bacteriological assayswhich we usedto
ascertain their presence,a large fraction (60.8%) of the
bacteria we call 'faecal coli forms' correspond to what
Cabelli and Dufour refer to as Escherichja coli.ll
Similarly, our definition of faecal streptococciessentially
includes what these authors call 'enterococci'."
Our resultsalso confirm the predominanceof gastrointestinal morbidity among exposedpopulations; other
illnessessuch as respiratory tract, ear and skin infections
were less frequent whereas Seyfried6 and StevensonI
found a greater relative incidence of these ailments. In
Seyfried's work this is not unexpected since the concentration of faecal indicators was modest at Ontario
beachesand the sourceof contaminationcould be mainly
due to the bathers themselves. Indeed, coliform and
streptococcal bacteria are better predictors of gastrointestinal risk since they derive from the intestinal tract.
For this reason,the relationship we found between skin
diseaseand faecal coliform concentration is liable to be
due to the joint presenceof some other unknown agent.
However, this relationship is an interesting guide
for standard setting. This artefactuel relationship may
also hold true for skin disease and aeromonas or
pseudomonas.
Mailman, among others, claimed that the faecal
indicators usedfor freshand marine waterbacteriological
standards may be inadequate for swimming pool water
where microorganismsderived from the mouth, nose or
skin would be more relevant.21Our findings may not
hold for such swimming pool waters. Moreover, it has
been shown that marine bathing waters offer specific
conditions for the survival of (unknown) aetiological
agents, which may explain, among other reasons,why
the morbidity observed among populations exposedto
a contamination indexed by a given level of indicator
bacteria is greater for marine recreational waters than
for fresh waters.4.5Thus, the relevance of common
microbiological quality standards for these three types
of recreational waters remains debatable.
In our case of fresh river water, direct linear
regressionsdemonstratethat coliform indicator concentrations (total or faecal coliforms) are less strongly
correlated with the incidence rates of AGID than faecal
streptococci, the best correlation being found with
'objective' gastrointestinal symptoms which Cabelli

::

considers more amenable to standard criteria derivation.22The gastrointestinal morbidity rateswe predicted
through these linear regressionsare remarkably similar
to those derived by Dufour from lake water dataSand
are in reasonable agreementwith what Seyfried found
on Ontario '. beaches; 7 indeed, despite some
dissimilarities in the time frame of observation, these
three prospective studies can be compared for
gastrointestinal morbidity which mainly occurs 12to 24
hours after exposure to contaminated water. The concentrationsabovewhich the AGID-risk among swimmers
exceeds the gastrointestinal morbidity among nonswimmers are lower than the current European guide
standard for faecal streptococci. To prevent sucha risk,
this standard should be set at about 20 SF/lOOmlif one
considers serious gastrointestinal illnesses, and even
lower (about 7/100ml)for totaI gastrointestinalcases.fur
faecal coliforms, whose relationship with the morbidity
rate is looser, the corresponding limits are 800/100rnl
and 270/I00rnl.
On the other hand, if one is willing to accept a
maximum threefold increase of 'objective' gastrointestinal morbidity among bathers, then the corresponding limits would be lOO/lOOrnl(FS) and close to
2000/l00rnl (FC); the former is the current European
guide standard for FS and the latter is the imperative
standard for FC.
A 1984 US-EPA draft document calling for public
comment proposed using the level of 20 SF/1OOmland
77 E.Coli/lOOrnl as new bacteriological standards for
fresh recreational water.23While our findings agree
well with the former, they do not give support to the
latter limit.
This paper presentsa somewhatelementarystatistical
analysis of our data. Possible confounding may stem
from, among other causes,differences in demographic
characteristicsand bathing behaviourbetweenswimmers
and non-swimmers. This warrants funher investigation
and accommodationof adjustmenttechniqu~s.A logistic
regressionmodel wasused whose resultsare presented
elsewhere.24It was based on an alternative analytical
approachthat could accommodatecumulative incidence
data instead of incidence rates. The preceding findings
about faecal streptococci were not substantiallyaltered.
The relative risk of 'objective AGIO' significantly
exceeded1 among bathers as opposed to non-bathers
abovea level of 20-60 SF/lOOrnl,controlling for faecal
colifonn concentration and the above mentioned
potential confounders; however, and conversely, the
evidence for an independent predictive role of faecal
colifonns, after adjustment for faecal streptococciconcentration was less clear, confirming the prominent role
of FS.
