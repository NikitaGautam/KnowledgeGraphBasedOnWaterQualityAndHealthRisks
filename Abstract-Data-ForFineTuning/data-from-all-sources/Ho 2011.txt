ABSTRACT: Shoreline concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria
(FIB) and fecal indicator viruses (FIV) in Avalon Bay (Catalina
Island, California) display a marked diurnal pattern (higher at night
and lower during the day) previously attributed to the tidal ﬂux of
sewage-contaminated groundwater and the tidal washing of contaminated sediments, coupled with light and dark die-oﬀ of FIB and
FIV (Boehm, et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43, 8046-8052). In
this paper we document the existence of strong (peak velocities
between 20 to 40 cm/s) transient currents in the nearshore waters
of Avalon Bay that occur between 07:00 and 20:00 each day. These
currents, which have a signiﬁcant onshore component, are generated by anthropogenic activities in the Bay, including prop wash
from local boat traﬃc and the docking practices of large passenger
ferries. A budget analysis carried out on simultaneous measurements
of FIB at two cross-shore locations indicates that anthropogenic
currents contribute to the diurnal cycling of FIB concentrations
along the shoreline, by transporting relatively unpolluted water from oﬀshore toward the beach. The data and analysis presented in this
paper support the idea that anthropogenic currents represent a signiﬁcant, and previously overlooked, source of variability in shoreline
water quality.

’ INTRODUCTION
Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used to assess bathing water
quality at recreational beaches throughout the world.2 Their
widespread adoption as water quality indicators is based on
several considerations, including their presence at high concentrations in sewage and other fecal waste and epidemiological
studies that suggest a dose-response relationship between
recreational waterborne illness and FIB concentrations at freshwater and marine bathing beaches, particularly in settings where
the source of FIB is partially treated or untreated human
sewage.3,4 Currents are an important feature of a site’s physical
setting that can strongly inﬂuence the sources, spatiotemporal
variability, and public health signiﬁcance of FIB concentrations
measured along the shoreline.5 Because currents transport water
parcels from one location to another, they link sources of fecal
pollution (e.g., drains, sewage outfalls) to receptors (e.g., humans
recreating at a beach) or, conversely, replace and disperse
contaminated water along the shoreline with clean water from
oﬀshore.6-8 Currents also mobilize sediment-associated FIB and
pathogens into the overlying water column by the generation of
ﬂuid shear at the sediment bed, and aﬀect light and dark
inactivation rates through the resuspension of ﬁne particles.9
Although signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding
the relationship between shoreline water quality and nearshore

currents along unsheltered beaches where large breaking waves
determine the direction and magnitude of alongshore and crossshore (rip) currents,7,10,11 relatively less is known about sheltered
embayments where water quality is often very poor.12
This study describes ﬁeld measurements of currents and water
quality in Avalon Bay, a tidal embayment in southern California
where shoreline waters at several popular recreational beaches
frequently test above state and federal water quality criteria
guidelines. The objectives of the study were to (1) characterize
currents, winds, waves, and density stratiﬁcation in Avalon Bay;
(2) measure cross-shore FIB concentration gradients very close
to shore; and (3) estimate from these data the relative contribution of cross-shore advection and light and dark die-oﬀ to diurnal
variations in shoreline water quality at Avalon’s most popular
bathing beach.

(Figure 1A). The site has a Mediterranean climate typical of
coastal southern California, with warm (17-28 °C) dry summers
and cool (9 to 18 °C) wet winters; an average of 3-8 cm of rain
falls in a typical month in the wet season, from November through
March.13 The Bay experiences 1-2 m mixed-tides that vary in
amplitude with the spring-neap cycle. Beaches within the Bay are
sheltered from large waves present on the open coast, and are
characterized by a ratio of tide range to wave height typically >3.
Two breakwaters ﬂank the entrance to Avalon Bay (Casino and
Mole, Figure 1B); despite the presence of these breakwaters,
there is vigorous tidal exchange of water between the Bay and
ocean, and signiﬁcant within-Bay turbulent mixing and advective
transport.14 The City of Avalon (area 6.9 km2) is the largest town
on the island with 3500 year-round residents, and its primary
source of revenue is tourism. On a typical summer day 17,500
tourists arrive via ferry, cruise ship, or personal vessel, and up to
400 vessels are moored in Avalon Bay. The City’s sewage is piped
to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) south of town that has
a treatment capacity of 4.5 x106 L/d. The main beach area of

Avalon Bay has suﬀered chronic water quality problems, with FIB
concentrations frequently exceeding State and Federal guidance
criteria for marine bathing waters. Furthermore, water testing
along the shoreline reveals the presence of several indicators of
human waste, including human fecal-speciﬁc Bacteroidales and
human enterovirus.1,15 A series of studies have implicated sewage-contaminated shallow groundwater as a primary source of
FIB in the nearshore region, which appears to enter the bay from
the shoreline during falling tides.1,15

’ METHODS
Pleasure Pier Deployments. An upward-looking acoustic
Doppler current profiler (ADCP, 1200kHz Workhorse Monitor,
RD Instruments, Poway, CA) was mounted to a submersible
tripod (Sea Spider, Ocean Sciences, Oceanside, CA) and hoisted
over the southeast (downcoast) side of a commercial and
recreational pier called the “Pleasure Pier” (white star,
Figure 1B) until it came to rest on the seabed in 4-6 m of

water. The ADCP was deployed 6 separate times (referred to as
deployments D1 through D6) over a four-month period from
February through June 2009; each deployment lasted between 9
and 17 days (Table 1). Between deployments, data were downloaded from the instrument and the transducers were cleaned.
The ADCP was set to record horizontal currents in 55 depth
bins, each 0.25 m in vertical extent, at a nominal sampling
frequency of 1 Hz. Coincident with the ADCP deployment,
wind speed and direction were measured with a weather station
(HOBO U30-NRC, Onset Corporation, Bourne, MA) located
on top of the lifeguard headquarters on the Pleasure Pier at a
nominal sampling frequency of 0.0011 Hz. Time series of
measured parameters were smoothed and interpolated (and in
the case of the ADCP data, component depth-averaged) to a final
sampling frequency of 1/5 min-1 using custom codes implemented in the data analysis program Igor Pro (v 6.12, Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR).
Bay-Wide Deployment. On October 23-26 (2009) three
bottom mounted upward-looking ADCPs were deployed at the
following locations in Avalon Bay: (1) 1200 kHz ADCP was
deployed in 4-6 m of water at the Pleasure Pier location
described above (white star, Figure 1B); (2) 1200 kHz ADCP
was deployed in 8-10 m of water near the Mole breakwater
(white triangle, Figure 1B); and (3) 600 kHz ADCP was
deployed in 7-9 m of water near the Tuna Club (white cross,
Figure 1B). Time stamped video images of ferries docked near
the Mole breakwater were obtained from a City of Avalon
security camera mounted approximately 25 m above sea level.
Principal Component Analysis of Depth-Averaged Currents. The first principal component of depth-averaged currents
was computed for each ADCP deployment as follows. A data
matrix was prepared from time series of the demeaned east- and
north-components of the depth-averaged currents. A covariance
matrix was then computed from the data matrix, and eigenvalues
and eigenvectors were computed from the covariance matrix
(Matlab, 7.0, Natick, MA). The eigenvector associated with the
largest eigenvalue (i.e., the “first principal component”) indicates the
direction over which the depth-averaged current fluctuates the most.
Significant Wave Height and Average Wave Period. Significant wave height and average wave period were calculated
from the raw (i.e., not smoothed) water elevation measurements
recorded by the ADCP during deployments D1-D6 at the
Pleasure Pier. Water elevation measurements, which were recorded at a nominal sampling frequency of 1 Hz, were interpolated to an evenly spaced time series with a fixed sampling
frequency of 1 Hz. The evenly spaced water elevation data (η)
were then divided into a sequence of contiguous 10-min time
periods and for each 10-min time interval the significant wave
height was computed from the zeroth moment m0 of the spectral
density Sη of the water elevation data:16

Because the sampling frequency of our ADCP was set to 1 Hz,
the Nyquist frequency is 0.5 Hz, which implies wave periods of
less than 2 s cannot be resolved with our instrument setup.17

to diurnal cycling of FIB concentrations in Avalon Bay, a field
experiment was conducted as follows. Beginning October 28
(2008) at 22:40 local time, Bay water samples were collected
simultaneously at two cross-shore sites every 30 min for approximately 2.5 days. These two sampling sites were located adjacent to
the Pleasure Pier: (1) at the shoreline in approximately ankle-deep
water (site S in Figure 1B), and (2) at a floating dock attached to
the Pleasure Pier in approximately 3-5 m of water depending on
the tide level (site F in Figure 1B). Because the shoreline site
moved up and down the beach face with the tide, the distance
between these two sampling sites varied continuously over the
study. All water samples were collected from the surface of the
water column in sterile Nalgene bottles, capped, immediately placed
in an iced cooler, and analyzed within a holding time of 6 h at a field
laboratory located at Avalon City Hall for Escherichia coli (EC)
and enterococci bacteria (ENT) using defined substrate tests
known commercially as Colilert-18 and Enterolert, implemented
in a 97-well quanti-tray format. These tests provide a quantitative
estimate for the concentration of FIB in a sample in units of most
probable number (MPN) per 100 mL of sample. The Colilert-18
and Enterolert tests were run after diluting the original samples
1:10 into deionized water; for this choice of dilution, the lower
and upper limits of detection for the Colilert-18 and Enterolert
tests were 10 and 24192 MPN/100 mL, respectively. During
approximately one-fifth of the sampling events, replicate water
samples were collected at both the shoreline and float sites. FIB
measurements at the two cross-shore sites were used to estimate
the magnitude of cross-shore advection and die-off terms in the
advection-diffusion equation (c.f., eq 3 in ref 18):
y-advection ½MPN=100 mL h-1  ¼ V ðtÞ
Die-off ½MPN=100 mL h-1 

These two equations yield estimates for the instantaneous
contributions of cross-shore advection (eq 2a) and light and
dark mortality (eq 2b) to change in FIB concentration at the
shoreline (in units of MPN/100 mL h-1). Variables in these
equations represent the cross-shore velocity V(t)[ms-1]
(positive values denoting offshore), difference between FIB
concentrations measured at the float and shoreline ΔC(t) =
CFloat(t)-CShore(t) [MPN m-3], cross-shore distance between
the float and shoreline sites Δy(t) = (yFloat - yShoreline(t))[m]
where y is a cross-shore coordinate (positive values denoting
offshore), rate constant for solar-mediated die-off kSun[s-1I-1
UVB],
UVB intensity IUVB[mW-2], and rate constant for dark die-off
kDark[s-1]. The cross-shore distance between sampling sites Δy
was estimated expost facto from the local slope of the beach and
NOAA predictions of tide level for the study period.19 Values for
the die-off rate constants were adopted from a previous study
in Avalon Bay:1 kSun = 6.9  10-5 (EC) and 8.1  10-5(ENT)

these data were contaminated by noise from the pitch and roll of

’ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Pleasure Pier Deployment: Depth-Averaged Currents.
The Pleasure Pier bisects the main beach in Avalon Bay, where
most bathers recreate and water quality is historically poor.
Depth-averaged currents at the Pleasure Pier displayed one of
three dominant patterns (Figure 1C): (1) westward currents
with peak velocities between 10 and 20 cm/s (all six
deployments); (2) southwestward currents with peak velocities
between 10 and 30 cm/s (deployments D1 and D4-D6); and
(3) south to south-southeastern currents with peak velocities of
10 cm/s (deployments D2, D3, and D4). Time- and depthaveraged currents at the Pleasure Pier are consistently oriented
west or southwest, as are the first principal components of the
depth-averaged current, which account for between 61 and 85%
of the current variance (Figure S1 and Table S1, Supporting
Information (SI)). Given the local strike of the shoreline, these
results imply that nearshore currents at the Pleasure Pier are
oriented either directly onshore (southwestard currents) or
possess a significant onshore component (westward and
south-southeastern currents) (Figure 1C).
Currents measured at the Pleasure Pier manifest as discrete
pulses that rarely occur before 07:00 in the morning or after
20:00 at night (Figure 2; see also time series for the ﬁrst principal
component loadings in Figures S2 and S3). While there is
considerable day-to-day variability, on average four major current
pulses occur per day during a typical weekday (black curves in
Figure 2B and C) and at least eight major current pulses occur per
day during a typical weekend (black curves in Figure 2E and F).
Both the west (Figure 2B and E) and southwest (Figure 2C and
F) components of the depth-averaged current exhibit this pulsing
pattern. During weekdays, these current pulses frequently occur
about 30 min after the scheduled arrival times of large
(approximately 40 m long) passenger ferries (compare arrival
times of ferries in Figure 2A with average current patterns
denoted by heavy black curves in Figure 2B and C). The number
of scheduled passenger ferries approximately doubles during
weekends, as does the number of current pulses measured at
the Pleasure Pier (compare Figure 2D, E, and F). In Avalon
Harbor, ferries dock at a commercial facility at the Mole Breakwater which is located approximately 200 m to the east-northeast of the Pleasure Pier (see Figure 1B).
However, not all current pulses measured at the Pleasure Pier
can be attributed to the arrival of ferries at the Mole. For example,

compared with the docking schedules of large ferries at the Mole. Panels
A and D: number of ferries docked at the Mole during a typical weekday
(A) and weekend (D). Panels B and C: depth-averaged westward (B)
and southwestward (C) currents measured during weekdays at the
Pleasure Pier. Panels E and F: depth-averaged westward (E) and
southwestward (F) currents measured during weekends at the Pleasure
Pier. Dark black curves in Panels B, C, E, and F correspond to the average
of all curves shown in a given panel.

during deployment D5, two overlapping pulses occurred most
weekday mornings (Figure 2B and C). The ﬁrst pulse appears to
correlate, with a 30 min delay, with the 07:30 ferry, but the
second (08:30) pulse does not obviously correlate with the ferry
schedule. The second pulse’s relative strength (peak velocities of
30 cm/s) and orientation (southwest, parallel to the Pleasure
Pier) are consistent with prop wash from a boat docked at the
Pleasure Pier.
Assuming that the ﬁrst principal component of the depthaveraged current vector represents anthropogenic currents,
which appears to be the case based on the daytime pulses evident
in the ﬁrst principal component loadings (see Figures S2 and S3),
we estimate that between 61 and 85% (depending on
deployment) of the measured current variance at the Pleasure
Pier has an anthropogenic origin (Table S1).
Pleasure Pier Deployment: Vertical Current Profiles. Vertical profiles of horizontal currents measured at the Pleasure Pier
typically exhibit one of three patterns: (1) constant speed over
the measured portion of the water column; (2) increasing speed
toward the surface of the measured portion of the water column;
or (3) increasing speed toward the bottom of the measured

portion of the water column (Figures S4-S18, SI). The first two
patterns are typical of current pulses that correlate with the arrival
of ferries at the Mole, whereas the third pattern is typical of the
stronger southwest (pier-parallel) current pulses, and may reflect
bottom impingement of momentum jets generated by boats
docked at the Pleasure Pier. The ferry-correlated pulses, on the
other hand, appear to originate when ferries docked at the Mole
continuously apply reverse thrust to force the ferry securely
against the dock. Based on field observations described later, this
practice has the effect of forcing water up against the shoreline
near the Mole, and initiating a momentum and/or gravity-driven
clockwise circulation along the outer edge of the Bay. It is this
clockwise circulation that appears to be responsible for the ferrycorrelated current pulses detected by our ADCP at the Pleasure
Pier.
Pleasure Pier Deployment: Wind and Waves. Winds measured at the Pleasure Pier have peak speeds of 5-8 m/s
(depending on the deployment) and typically follow a diurnal
pattern characterized by onshore flow (directed to the southsouthwest) during the day and offshore flow (directed to the
north-northeast) at night (see Principal Component Analysis in
SI Figures S19-S21). Because the wind direction undergoes
daily reversals, time-averaged wind vectors at the Pleasure Pier
are small in magnitude (<0.5 m/s) and variable in direction
(Figure S19, SI). Significant wave heights and average wave
periods generally fluctuate between 0.1 and 0.2 m and 6 and 12 s,
respectively, except during storm events when wave heights can
reach 0.5 m (March 16, 2009, Figures S22-S27, SI). These wind

better constrain the origin of the current pulses measured at

nearshore currents at three locations in the Bay: (1) near where

the ferries dock (Mole), (2) at the Pleasure Pier, and (3)
northwest of the Pleasure Pier (Tuna Club) (white triangle, star,
and cross in Figure 1B). ADCP measurements at the Mole site
reveal strong (upward of 25 cm/s) westward currents (Figure S28)
that exhibit the same pulsing pattern described above for ADCP
measurements at the Pleasure Pier (Figures S29-S30). When
the first principal component loadings of the depth-averaged
currents measured at the Mole and Pleasure Pier sites are
coplotted against time, current pulses are observed to arrive first
at the Mole site and then later at the Pleasure Pier site
(Figure 3A). Cross-correlation of these two signals reveals that,
on average, the Pleasure Pier pulse lags the Mole pulse by
approximately 30 min, consistent with the earlier observation that
current pulses at the Pleasure Pier frequently arrive 20-30 min
after the arrival of ferries at the Mole. Dividing the time lag
between Mole and Pleasure Pier (30 min) into the approximate
distance separating these two sites (200 m) yields a propagation
speed of approximately 10 cm/s, which is similar to peak current
speeds measured at both sites. Based on a review of time stamped
video images of the ferry dock, the onset of the westward current
at the Mole site occurs several minutes after the arrival of a ferry
at the dock (T1), peaks after the ferry has been docked for about
20 min (T2), and rapidly decays after the ferry leaves (T3)
(Figure 3B). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
at least some of the current pulses measured at the Pleasure Pier
are triggered when ferries apply reverse thrust (directing water
directly toward the shore) while docked at the Mole. Currents
measured at the Tuna Club are oriented parallel to the local strike
of the shoreline (northwest-southeast, see scatter plot in Figure
S28) and do not exhibit a pulsing pattern (Figure S29). Instead,
the first principal component of depth-averaged currents at Tuna

Club, which captures 92% of the data variance, displays relatively
long (>20 h) periods of either up-coast or down-coast flow
(Figure S30).
FIB Budget Analysis. Based on the results presented above,
currents very close to the shoreline in Avalon Bay appear to be
dominated by anthropogenic activities: in particular, ferries
docked at the Mole facility and local boat traffic at the Pleasure
Pier. The vector of these currents is directed either directly
onshore (local boat traffic) or at an approximately 45° angle to
the shore (ferry-induced currents), implying significant onshore
flow in both cases. To the extent that nearshore waters in Avalon
Bay are contaminated by the discharge of sewage-contaminated
groundwater, as has been previously hypothesized,1,15 onshore
currents may have a positive impact on nearshore water quality,
by transporting cleaner water from the middle of the Bay toward
the shoreline. To evaluate if such a mechanism could contribute
to the diurnal cycling of FIB and FIV previously observed at this
site, we carried out an experiment in which water samples were
collected every 30 min for approximately 2.5 days at two
locations: (1) the shoreline near the Pleasure Pier, and (2) a
short distance (20-50 m, depending on tide level) bay-ward of
the shoreline at a float attached to the Pleasure Pier (sites S and F
in Figure 1B). Raw data from this field study are presented in the
SI (Figure S31). FIB concentrations in these samples were very
frequently higher at site S and lower at site F, as evidenced by the
large and negative relative percent difference (RPD) calculated
for the raw and log-transformed EC and ENT measurements at
these two sites (Table 2); for comparison the RPD values
calculated for replicate samples are also included in this table.
The average buoyancy frequency calculated from CTD measurements of salinity and temperature (0.013 ( 0.006 s-1) is well

below the threshold indicative of a stratified water column (>0.1
s-1), consistent with the idea that the water column is relatively
well-mixed over the vertical21 (raw salinity and temperature
profile data presented in Figure S32). The steep cross-shore
gradient in FIB concentration, coupled with shoreward directed
currents generated by anthropogenic activities in Avalon Bay,
give rise to a cross-shore advection term that is, on the whole,
larger in magnitude than the die-off term in the advectiondiffusion equation (compare panels A and C (EC) and B and D
(ENT) in Figure 4). Both the advection and die-off terms are
approximately log-normally distributed, with geometric means of
52 and 7 MPN/100 mL h-1 (EC) and 5 and 1.8 MPN/100 mL
h-1 (ENT). If sustained, the larger values for the cross-shore
advection term are sufficient to cause, within a single hour, a drop
in the FIB concentration at the shoreline on par with California’s
marine bathing water single-sample criteria for EC (400 MPN/
100 mL) and ENT (104 MPN/100 mL). Given the probability
distributions presented in Figure 4, anthoropogenically forced
currents appear to influence shoreline water quality as much as,
or more than, light and dark die-off, and could certainly account
for at least a portion of the diurnal water quality signal previously
observed in Avalon Bay. Studies are presently underway to
evaluate the effect of anthropogenic currents on bottom shear
stress, particle resuspension, and vertical flux of FIB in the
nearshore waters at this field site.
