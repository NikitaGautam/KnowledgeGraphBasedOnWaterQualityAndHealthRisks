Summary Objectives: To determine the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of
rotavirus among adults admitted to the hospital with diarrhea that have bacterial stool cultures sent.
Methods: The prevalence of rotavirus was determined by Rotaclone EIA in samples submitted
for bacterial stool culture from adults requiring hospitalization at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago from December 01, 2005eNovember 30, 2006.
Results: Rotavirus was detected in 2.9% of eligible bacterial stool cultures. A bacterial pathogen (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) was identified in 3.3%. Bacterial stool pathogens were more common from JuneeOctober while rotavirus was 2.4 times more common than
all bacterial pathogens from FebruaryeMay. Adults in whom rotavirus was detected were older
(p < 0.05) and more often immunosuppressed (p < 0.02), particularly with HIV (p < 0.04) compared to individuals from whom bacteria were isolated. The duration of hospitalization and the
number of invasive procedures performed in those with rotavirus and bacterial diarrhea were
comparable.
Conclusions: In the era immediately prior to widespread rotavirus vaccination of children, rotavirus was as commonly detected from adults admitted to the hospital with diarrhea as are
the bacterial gastroenteritis pathogens. Rotavirus is particularly prevalent from FebruaryeMay
(as in children) and in immunosuppressed or older adults.

Introduction
In the United States (US) approximately 452,000 people
over 20 years of age are hospitalized each year with
gastroenteritis.1 Testing for bacterial stool pathogens
(e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter) is recommended as the first step in the evaluation of communityacquired and traveler’s diarrhea.2 In only about 3% of adult
bacterial stool cultures (BSC) is a routine bacterial pathogen identified for community-acquired cases (notably Clostridium difficile is not tested for by BSC).2 Therefore, the
etiology of a diarrheal episode in adults is usually unknown.
Before the licensure of rotavirus vaccine for children in
2006, rotavirus was identified as responsible for up to half
of severe diarrheal illness in young children in both the
developed and developing worlds.3 Rotavirus results in an
estimated annual worldwide burden of 24 million outpatient visits, 2.4 million hospitalizations, and 527,000 deaths
among young children.4,5 Many physicians assume rotavirus
to be only a pathogen of young children and to occur only
zquez et al.6 detailed
once in a lifetime. However, Vela
the natural history of rotavirus in Mexican infants from birth
to 2 years of age, and showed that by the age of 2, 96% had
been infected with rotavirus at least once, 69% had at least
2 infections, and 13% had 5 infections. At least part of the
reason for these recurrent infections is that subsequent rotavirus infections are usually due to a different rotavirus Gtype.6
Although rotavirus infections are well-described in
adults, US epidemiological data are lacking.7,8 Thus, we undertook a study to evaluate the prevalence of rotavirus in
adults requiring hospitalization.

Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Northwestern University
Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome was to
determine the prevalence of rotavirus in bacterial stool
cultures from adults hospitalized with diarrhea at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH, Chicago, Illinois). This
was a retrospective cohort study of all subjects admitted
with diarrhea between December 1, 2005 and November
30, 2006 who had stool submitted for BSC. We used
submission of a BSC as a surrogate for clinically significant
diarrhea as defined by the Infectious Disease Society of
America (IDSA) guidelines.2 Subjects were also included if
they were hospitalized within 72 h of sending the stool
specimen, if they were admitted to observation for
>18 h, or if they remained in the emergency department
for >18 h. We excluded subjects who had been hospitalized
for more than 72 h at the time the BSC was sent to avoid including subjects with hospital-acquired diarrhea. Specimens from individuals <18 years of age, formed
specimens, and duplicate specimens were excluded. All
BSC samples submitted to NMH from inpatients were processed by the microbiology laboratory for identification of
routine bacterial stool pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter). Stools were not routinely tested
for C. difficile, Escherichiae coli O157:H7, or the presence
of Shiga toxin.The remaining stool, was frozen at 70  C
until it was tested for rotavirus.

E.J. Anderson et al.
All stool samples were subsequently thawed and tested
for Group A rotavirus with the Meridian Bioscience Inc.
(Cincinnati, Ohio) Rotaclone enzyme immunoassay (EIA),
which is specific for group A human rotavirus and has
been used in multiple studies.9e11

RT-PCR identification of the G- and P-genotypes of
Rotaclone positive samples
Genetic identification of the G- and P-genotypes of the
samples identified as positive by the Rotaclone EIA-assay
was performed. RNA was extracted with the QIAamp Viral
RNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) as has
been previously described.12 Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using
the primer sets specific for G- and P-genotypes13,14 using
the Qiagen One-Step RT PCR Kit.12

Patient characteristics
Data from the medical records of the subjects who had
rotavirus detected were abstracted and compared with
those with bacterial diarrhea who were rotavirus negative.
Data collected included demographic information, risk
factors for acquisition, underlying medical comorbidities,
symptoms, laboratory findings, and outcomes. Individuals
were considered immunosuppressed if they were HIV positive, were receiving >20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent
steroids for 2 weeks, or were receiving chemotherapy or
other immunomodulators (e.g., methotrexate or monoclonal antibodies against TNF or a lymphocyte subset).
We determined whether subjects that had BSC available
for rotavirus testing were similar to subjects that had stools
sent for BSC but that were not saved by comparing demographic and clinical criteria, and outcomes between
a random group of those that had BSC available for rotavirus
testing and the same number of randomly selected subjects
from whom BSC were not saved.

Statistical analysis
Demographic and patient characteristics were summarized.
The prevalence of rotavirus was expressed as the number of
subjects with positive stool samples divided by the total
number subjects. Comparison of patient characteristics
between those positive for rotavirus and those positive
for bacterial pathogens was performed using univariate
analysis. Continuous variables that were normally distributed were tested using two-sample t-tests. For those that
were not normally distributed, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests
were performed. Categorical variables were tested by either Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests depending on the
distribution of the data by group. Some categorical variables were reclassified as dichotomous in the event that
a number of categorical classifications occurred with few
or zero frequency counts in either or both groups. In the
case of rehospitalization, results were presented with the
data characterized as both a continuous measure (in weeks
since last hospitalization) and as a dichotomous variable.
All analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

Rotavirus in hospitalized adults

Results
Diarrheal etiologies
Between December 1, 2005 and November 30, 2006, 1046
bacterial stool cultures (BSC) met the inclusion criteria for
this study. 620 of these 1046 (59.3%) BSC were available for
rotavirus testing. Eighteen of 620 (2.9%) samples had
rotavirus detected by Rotaclone. Rotavirus was detected
in 0e6.5% of BSC per month (see Figure 1). Rotavirus was
most commonly identified between February and May,
with 10/202 (5.0%) samples positive, while rotavirus was
identified in only 8/418 (1.9%) samples from June through
January (p Z 0.03).
A bacterial pathogen was identified in 34 of the 1046
samples (3.25%). The most common pathogen was Campylobacter (18, 1.7%) followed by Salmonella (7, 0.7%), Shigella
(5, 0.5%), E. coli O157:H7 (2, 0.2%), and Aeromonas species
(2, 0.2%). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 0e8.8% of
BSC per month (see Figure 1). Marked seasonality, opposite
that of rotavirus, was noted for these bacterial pathogens,
with 11/610 (1.8%) samples positive from November
through May and 23/436 (5.3%) positive from June through
October (p Z 0.002). During the months of FebruaryeMay,
all bacterial pathogens combined were identified in 2.1% of
BSC (rotavirus had a 2.4 times higher prevalence,
p Z 0.083). The prevalence of all bacterial pathogens combined (3.25%) and rotavirus (2.9%) over the study was similar (p Z 0.77).

of rotavirus (Positive/Total BSC tested).

Epidemiological risk factors, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcomes of subjects with bacterial and
rotavirus gastroenteritis are compared in Table 1. In one subject, both rotavirus and Campylobacter jejuni was identified;
this lone subject was excluded from further comparisons.
Adults in whom rotavirus was detected were older and tended
to be more immunosuppressed, particularly by HIV, than
those with bacterial pathogens. More subjects with bacterial
infections had chills, had traveled outside the country within
the two weeks prior to admission, and were treated with antibiotics, although antibiotics were also administered to over
half of the rotavirus positive subjects. Although the median
number of vomiting episodes/day was the same in both
groups, a greater proportion of subjects with rotavirus reported 2 vomiting episodes/day (47% of rotavirus infections
compared to 9% of bacterial; see Table 1). All other outcomes
were similar between rotavirus and those with a bacterial
pathogen, including the length of hospital stay (median 2
days), readmission rate, and mortality within 2 months.

Possible sources of bias
We also compared epidemiological risk factors and clinical
outcomes of 109 randomly selected subjects who had a BSC
sent and an aliquot saved for rotavirus testing with another
randomly selected group of 109 subjects who had a BSC
sent but from whom an aliquot was not saved. No evidence
of a selection bias could be identified (p > 0.05 for all variables, data not shown).

in 2, G2P[4] in one patient, and G9P[6, 8] in one patient.

Discussion
Although diarrhea occurs commonly, the etiology is usually not
identified.2 While rotavirus is known to be responsible for up to
50% of pediatric wintertime gastroenteritis hospitalizations,3
the role of rotavirus in adult gastroenteritis is not well understood.7 We undertook this study to understand the epidemiology and clinical significant of rotavirus in adults who are
hospitalized with diarrhea. Because studies in adults suggested
that rotavirus may not be as seasonal in adults as it is in children, we conducted this study for 12 consecutive months.7

We noted a marked seasonality to rotavirus in adults,
with a peak prevalence of 5.0% from FebruaryeMay which
declined to 1.9% in JuneeJanuary (p Z 0.03). This corresponds to the classical pediatric rotavirus peak of March/
April in Chicago (data from Children’s Memorial Hospital,
not shown).15 The rotavirus winter-spring seasonality contrasts with the marked summer and fall seasonality of bacterial pathogens.16 The overall percentage of bacterial
pathogens identified in this study (3.25%) is similar to that
found in many other studies.2 Stool cultures are sent
more frequently by physicians when diarrhea lasts for 3
days or is bloody, features more commonly identified with
bacterial diarrhea.17 Despite this bias, rotavirus was still
identified in about the same percentage of BSC as all routinely tested bacterial pathogens combined. During peak
rotavirus season (FebruaryeMay), rotavirus was 2.4 times
more common than all bacterial pathogens combined. Rotavirus did not completely disappear during the summer
and fall. Thus, adults may be the local reservoir for

Rotavirus in hospitalized adults
persistent rotavirus during the summer months from which
pediatric rotavirus emerges each winter-spring to result in
widespread pediatric disease.18 The seasonality of rotavirus
in children has become less pronounced due to the impact
of widespread rotavirus vaccination, whether this might
also occur in adults is unknown.19
A few important epidemiological differences were identified between subjects who had rotavirus detected versus
subjects who had routine bacterial pathogens identified.
Rotavirus was more common in older subjects and in those
with underlying immunosuppression, particularly those
with HIV. Although rotavirus has been observed in prior
studies of immunocompromised groups, including those
that are HIV-infected, the epidemiologic evidence for this
being a risk factor is relatively new.7,20 Rotavirus has been
described in association with travel to Mexico, Jamaica,
and Central America,7 but fewer subjects in whom rotavirus
was detected had a history of international travel within
the preceding two weeks than did those with bacterial
pathogens. Although prior studies have demonstrated that
one-third to one-half of adults caring for children with rotavirus will develop rotavirus infections, we could not identify
exposure to children as a risk factor, perhaps due to the
retrospective nature of the study.7,21,22
Clinical features were similar between the groups with
rotaviral and bacterial gastroenteritis, except that more
bacterial-infected subjects had chills. Vomiting, observed
in up to 95% of pediatric rotavirus infections,23 occurred in
71% of adults. That 53% of rotavirus subjects received antibiotics for diarrhea was surprising. Equally surprising was
the frequent use of costly diagnostic tests such as CT scans
and endoscopy. Adults with rotavirus had similar outcomes
as those with bacterial diarrhea.
We observed a wide variety of rotavirus genotypes
among the adult isolates. G9P[8] was the most frequently
identified rotavirus genotypes, which was not expected,
since G1P[8] usually makes up about two-thirds of
rotavirus-related infections in children (even though circulating strains can vary dramatically from year to year).24,25
US surveillance has previously noted that G2P[4] was relatively more common among those individuals 60 months
(of which 74% were 5e9 years of age) than in those <60
months of age.25 The identification of G12P[6] in two subjects was surprising but has been increasingly observed, beginning in 2005e2006.26,27
A recent study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
administrative coding data (ICD-9-CM) indirectly estimated
that 3e5% of cause-unspecified gastroenteritis was due to
rotavirus (w18,000 admissions) in those 18 years.8 All
bacterial pathogens (excluding C. difficile) were also estimated to be w3% of all-cause diarrhea in all age groups.
Our data which resulted from direct testing of BSC for bacterial pathogens and for rotavirus identified these pathogens in 3.25% and 2.9% of BSC respectively. Thus, our
directly tested data strongly support the magnitude of
this indirect estimate of rotavirus disease in those 18
years of age.8 Additional study of the correlation between
administrative coding data and the direct burden of gastroenteritis is needed.
This study was initiated before widespread pediatric
rotavirus vaccination which began after February 2006.
Much of the initial uptake of rotavirus vaccine occurred late

5
in 2006, well after the peak adult rotavirus season (FebruaryeMay 2006) identified in this study; by early 2008, only
31% of US children <2 years of age had received 1 dose of
rotavirus vaccine.19 The impact of pediatric rotavirus vaccination upon the pediatric burden of disease occurred beginning during the 2007e2008 season, well after this study was
completed.19 Thus, it is highly unlikely that pediatric rotavirus vaccination had a significant impact on the prevalence
of rotavirus in this study. Ongoing study of the prevalence
of rotavirus in adults with diarrhea to determine the impact
of pediatric rotavirus vaccination upon the adult burden of
rotavirus disease and circulating rotavirus genotypes is
needed.
Our study has several limitations. Since it was a retrospective, one year, single-center study in a large teaching
hospital in Chicago, how generalizable these findings are
remains unknown. It is unknown whether the burden of
rotavirus in adults will remain unchanged subsequently
after widespread impact of rotavirus vaccination was
observed in children. We had very few patients admitted
from nursing homes which have been known to have
outbreaks of rotavirus disease.7 Since over 40% of patients
with rotavirus were immunocompromised, the clinical spectrum of illness observed in this study may not reflect the
degree of illness among immunocompentant adults.
Rotaclone has been shown to have greater sensitivity
than electron microscopy, with similar specificity.28,29 EIA
testing for rotavirus, such as with Rotaclone EIA, has
served as the reference standard for the evaluation of rotavirus in a large number of vaccine trials in children both in
the US and internationally but has not been extensively
evaluated in adults.9e11,30 Since limited data suggest that
adults shed 10e100 fold less rotavirus than do children,7
Rotaclone may underestimate the adult burden of disease
but avoids the potential of PCR contamination. Previous
challenge studies and the lack of carriage suggest that rotavirus was likely the etiology for our patients’ diarrhea although our study does not prove causality particularly in
the subjects in which another pathogen was identified.7
BSC did not identify all bacterial pathogens, notably Escherichiae coli O157:H7, those with shiga toxin, or C. difficile.
Since we did not exclude those patients with recent hospitalization or antibiotic administration, a percentage of our
study population may have had antibiotic-associated diarrhea or C. difficile. We observed no statistically significant
differences in a randomly selected subset of individuals
that had BSC saved versus those that did not have a BSC
saved. Yet, an unappreciated bias in the saving of BSCs
was possible. Finally, we did not test for norovirus which
appears to have a much greater burden of disease in adults
than rotavirus.8
Despite these limitations, our study contributes significantly to the understanding of rotavirus infections in adults
requiring hospitalization for diarrhea. A prior serological
study of families with children suggested that <20% of
rotavirus infections occurred in preschool children, with
almost half of the infections occurring in adults.31 We too
found a substantial burden of rotavirus in adults. The yearround prevalence of rotavirus (2.9%) was similar to that of
all bacterial pathogens combined (3.25%). Rotavirus has
a marked seasonality and during its peak (FebruaryeMay)
was 2.4 times more common than all routine bacterial stool

pathogens combined. The severity of illness and patient outcomes in those who were Rotaclone EIA positive was similar
to that of routine bacterial pathogens. A wide variety of rotavirus genotypes was observed. Finally, substantial unnecessary resources (e.g., antibiotics, CT imaging, endoscopy)
were expended in the management of those who were
Rotaclone EIA positive. The impact of widespread implementation of pediatric rotavirus vaccination on adult rotavirus infection needs to be determined.
