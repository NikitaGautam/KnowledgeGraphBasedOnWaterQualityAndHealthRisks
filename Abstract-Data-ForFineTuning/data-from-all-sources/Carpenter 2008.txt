Stool cultures can be important in guiding antimicrobial therapy for diarrhea. From among 11.64 million person-years of
Tennessee Medicaid enrollment data collected from 1995
through 2004, 315,828 diarrheal episodes were identified.
Stool cultures were performed for only 15,820 episodes
(5.0%). Antimicrobials were prescribed for 32,949 episodes
(10.4%), 89.4% of which were not accompanied by a stool culture. White race and urban residence were associated with
higher rates of stool culture. Frequent use of antimicrobials
for diarrhea without stool culture may indicate inappropriate
antimicrobial use and has critical implications for public
health.
Acute diarrheal illness has been estimated to affect ⬎200 million
persons annually in the United States, resulting in ⬃75 million
visits to health care providers [1]. Antimicrobial therapy is contraindicated when treating certain infectious diarrheal illnesses,
and published guidelines recommend the use of diagnostic stool
cultures when prescribing antimicrobials [2]. Stool culture is
also important in public health surveillance to determine the

bacterial causes of diarrheal disease, identify outbreaks, and implement appropriate control measures.
The extent to which providers fail to use stool cultures to
guide treatment of diarrhea is not well documented, nor is the
extent of antimicrobial use. Here, we quantified stool culturing
and antimicrobial prescribing in connection with episodes of
acute diarrhea among a large Medicaid population and identified factors associated with these practices.
Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all
persons aged ⬍65 years enrolled in TennCare from 1995
through 2004. TennCare is the managed health care program
covering Tennessee residents who are eligible for Medicaid. In
2005, ⬃1.22 million persons were enrolled, representing 21% of
the state’s population. Information was obtained from
TennCare outpatient visit records and pharmacy data. All outpatient episodes of diarrheal illness were included, along with
associated antimicrobial prescriptions and laboratory stool
studies. An episode was defined as an outpatient clinic or emergency department visit for diarrhea or a series of visits for diarrhea separated by 聿30 days. A new episode was defined as a visit
for diarrhea with no other visits for diarrhea during the previous
30 days; a single patient could have been responsible for ⬎1
episode per year.
On the basis of the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), a visit for diarrhea was defined as any visit with a physician-assigned code for
diarrhea (001, 002, 004, 005, 007– 009, 003.0, 006.0, 006.1, 006.2,
or 787.91) in the first of 9 possible diagnostic fields or a code for
dehydration (276.5) or for vomiting or nausea (787.0) in the first
field accompanied by a diarrhea code in any subsequent diagnostic field. For each diarrheal episode, we identified prescriptions for antimicrobials that are potentially prescribed for
diarrhea within 7 days after a visit; antimicrobials defined as
being potentially prescribed for diarrhea included chloramphenicol, ampicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, trimethroprimsulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, vancomycin, clindamycin,
and antihelminthics. All procedure codes indicating a completed
order for stool culture within 5 days before and 7 days after any
visit during an episode were identified. For all visits, we collected
data on patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence location (urban, suburban, or rural), month and year of visit, and setting of
visit (outpatient or emergency department). Diarrheal episodes

(ICD-9-CM codes 460 – 466, 480 – 487, 490, 786.07, 786.1, and

spiratory tract infection, antimicrobial prescribing, and stool
culturing. For comparison purposes, within the cohort of all
enrollees we identified urine cultures and complete blood counts
(CBCs) by use of procedure codes.
Multivariate modeling was used to analyze the effects of demographic variables and concurrent diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infection on the prescription of antimicrobials and the
probability of stool culture. Generalized estimating equations
with a Poisson link and a working independence correlation
structure were used to account for the correlation induced by
multiple visits for diarrhea per enrollee [3, 4]. Data were analyzed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute). The project
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of
the Tennessee Department of Health, Vanderbilt University,
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approval to
use deidentified data was provided by the Bureau of TennCare.
Results. During the 10-year study period, a mean of
1,164,000 persons (range, 1,085,349 –1,290,951 persons) aged
⬍65 years were enrolled in TennCare per year. Of the TennCare
enrollees, 74% were white and 18% were black, 44% were male,
45% were children aged 0 –17 years, and 41% were urban residents. According to the 2000 census, 80% of Tennessee’s population were white and 16% were black, 49% were male, 25% were
children aged 0 –17 years, and 44% were urban residents.
A total of 11.64 million person-years of enrollment data were
analyzed. Among these, 315,828 diarrheal episodes were identified (272 episodes/10,000 person-years) (figure 1). The rate was
higher for white persons than black persons (316 vs. 185 episodes/10,000 person-years), for females than males (283 vs. 256
episodes/10,000 person-years), and for rural and suburban residents than urban residents (324, 307, and 206 episodes/10,000
person-years, respectively). Most patients (肁92%) experienced

BRIEF REPORT

only a single diarrheal episode, and only a single visit was made
for 290,379 (91.9%) of the 315,828 diarrheal episodes.
Stool culture was performed for 15,820 (5.0%) of the 315,828
episodes. The proportion of diarrheal episodes associated with a
stool culture was highest among children aged ⬍3 months
(11.3%) and was lowest among adolescents aged 11–18 years
(2.7%) (figure 2A). The proportion of all diarrheal episodes associated with stool culture rose from 2.1% in 1995 to 5.8% in
2004 (figure 2B). By comparison, from 1995 through 2004, the
proportion of TennCare enrollees for whom at least 1 CBC was
performed increased from 14.3% to 33.7%, and the proportion
for whom 1 or more urine cultures were performed increased
from 2.6% to 6.4%.
Antimicrobials were prescribed for 32,949 diarrheal episodes
(10.4%), increasing from 8.1% in 1995 to 11.2% in 2004. Of
9448 diarrheal episodes among children aged ⬍3 months, 126
(1.3%) resulted in antimicrobial prescription, whereas 24,567
(15.6%) of 124,867 diarrheal episodes among adults aged 肁19
years resulted in antimicrobial prescription.
Of the diarrheal episodes for which antimicrobials were prescribed, 3504 (10.6%) had a stool culture performed (figure 1),
increasing from 5.6% in 1995 to 11.5% in 2004. Thirty-five
(28%) of 126 children aged ⬍3 months receiving antimicrobials
had a stool culture performed, compared with 376 (7.6%) of
4943 persons aged 19 –29 years.
Of all diarrheal episodes, 17,191 (5.4%) had a concurrent diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infection. Of these, antimicrobials were prescribed for 3193 (18.6%). Antimicrobials were prescribed for 29,755 episodes (10.0%) without a concurrent
diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infection. Stool culture was
performed for only 601 diarrheal episodes (3.5%) with a concurrent respiratory tract infection.
In a multiple regression model, white race (adjusted relative
risk [ARR], 1.32 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.26 –1.38]), urban residence (ARR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.59 –1.72]), antimicrobial
prescription (ARR, 3.08 [95% CI, 2.95–3.21]), and not receiving
a diagnosis of a concurrent acute respiratory tract infection
(ARR, 1.75 [85% CI, 1.61–1.92]) were associated with higher
rates of stool culture. In a separate model, white race (ARR, 1.08
[95% CI, 1.04 –1.12]), female sex (ARR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05–
1.11]), rural or suburban residence (ARR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02–
1.08]), having a stool culture performed (ARR, 3.08 [95% CI,
2.95–3.21]), and receiving a diagnosis of a concurrent acute respiratory tract infection (ARR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.41–2.63]) were
associated with higher rates of antimicrobial prescription.
Discussion. In this large outpatient study, stool culture was
rarely used for patients with diarrhea. Antimicrobials were more
commonly prescribed and were accompanied by a stool culture
only a tenth of the time. Guidelines from physician groups and
public health agencies promote the use of diagnostic stool cultures when prescribing antimicrobials for diarrhea [2]. The limited proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions accompanied by

stool culture and the fact that only a small minority of stool
cultures eventually identify a pathogen suggest that few antimicrobial prescriptions for diarrheal disease are guided by a microbiologic diagnosis [5]. Antimicrobials are frequently used inappropriately for the treatment of acute enteric infections.
Inappropriate antimicrobial use can lead to adverse outcomes,
increased costs, and antimicrobial resistance [6].
The rate of diarrhea found in the present study was somewhat
lower than that reported in older studies (e.g., Roy et al. [7]),
although this is unsurprising given that our study relied on the
documentation of clinical visits rather than on self-report; in
addition, there are well-recognized limitations to comparing results among diarrheal prevalence surveys [7].

Health care provider and patient surveys have demonstrated
infrequent stool culturing, even when antimicrobials are prescribed. A North Carolina survey reported that 肁80% of 284
physicians did not request stool sampling for 75%–100% of patients with acute diarrheal illness [8]. In a multistate populationbased telephone survey, 5.1% of respondents reported having
had an acute diarrheal illness during the previous month [9]. Of
those, only 3.7% had a stool culture ordered, and 7.8% were
treated with antimicrobials. Although that large study relied on
self-report, the results are similar to our findings. In another
study based on the chart review of pediatric emergency and urgent care visits in one hospital, 24% of visits for acute diarrheal
illness resulted in antimicrobial prescriptions [10]. Our study,

using information from actual clinical visits, adds validity to
these various survey results.
Stool culture has been perceived as being a diagnostic tool that
causes expense without often yielding useful results. In one large
hospital, only 2.4% of stool cultures identified a pathogen, and
in ⬍5% of the cases did the culture results lead to a change in
therapy [11]. Among outpatients, positive culture results have
been reported in 6%–15% of cultures [5, 12]. Nevertheless, diagnostic stool cultures can be important to both clinical and
public health practice. Certain diarrheal illnesses respond well to
properly selected antimicrobial treatment [2]. In addition, a microbial diagnosis can be the critical first step in detecting foodborne or waterborne outbreaks. Diarrheal disease outbreaks for
which stool specimens were collected were 10 times more likely
to have the outbreak source identified than were those for which
specimens were not collected [13].
Ordering of stool cultures increased modestly during the 10year study period. Concurrently, the proportion of TennCare
enrollees for whom a CBC or urine culture was performed doubled, indicating a general trend toward increased diagnostic testing not specific for diarrheal disease. The observed increases in
rates of testing and antimicrobial use are not unique to this
study, and the reasons are not well understood but could include
increasing patient expectations, malpractice concerns, and reimbursement issues.
In the present study, higher rates of stool culture were associated with white race and urban residence, both of which are
typically associated with greater access to health care. White persons were also more likely to be prescribed antimicrobials for
diarrhea, consistent with the results of studies of treatment for
respiratory tract infections [14]. Compared with young children, adolescents and adults had lower rates of stool culture and
higher rates of antimicrobial prescription.
A small proportion of patients with diarrhea in our study
(⬍6%) received a diagnosis of a concurrent acute respiratory
tract infection for which drugs on our list of antimicrobials
could have been prescribed. A concurrent diagnosis of a respiratory tract infection was associated with a lower rate of stool
culture and a higher rate of antimicrobial prescription. Diarrheal and respiratory tract illnesses frequently have a common
viral etiology. This may have led providers to a presumptive diagnosis of a viral syndrome and to view stool culture as being less
useful, although the concomitant increase in antimicrobial use is
a worrisome contradiction to this assumption.
Twenty-one percent of the Tennessee population is enrolled
in TennCare, and the demographics of the enrolled population
closely mirror those of the state’s population; however, a dispro-

portionate number of enrollees are children, and some results
might not be generalizable to other populations. Because the
investigation was conducted using an administrative database,
we were unable to assess disease severity or microbiological results related to provider decisions in the treatment of patients
with diarrhea.
In this large, multiyear outpatient study, stool culture was
rarely used to guide antimicrobial therapy among the patients
visiting a health care provider for diarrhea. Antimicrobials were
prescribed for ⬎10% of diarrheal episodes. The potentially imprudent use of antimicrobials and a lack of information from
diagnostic stool cultures have implications for both clinical and
public health practice. Optimization of stool culture for public
health surveillance, as a diagnostic tool, and as a guide to antimicrobial therapy warrants further attention.
