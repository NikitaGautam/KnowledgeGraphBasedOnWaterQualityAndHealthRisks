Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that are
responsible for both enteric illnesses and respiratory and
eye infections. Recently, these viruses have been found
to be prevalent in rivers, coastal waters, swimming pool
waters, and drinking water supplies worldwide. United Sates
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) listed adenovirus
as one of nine microorganisms on the Contamination
Candidate List for drinking water because their survival
characteristic during water treatment is not yet fully
understood. Adenoviruses have been found to be significantly
more stable than fecal indicator bacteria and other
enteric viruses during UV treatment. Adenovirus infection
may be caused by consumption of contaminated water
or inhalation of aerosolized droplets during water recreation.
The goal of this review is to summarize the state of
technology for adenovirus detection in natural and drinking
waters and the human health risk imposed by this
emerging pathogen. The occurrence of these viruses in
natural and treated waters is summarized from worldwide
reports.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports 1.8 million
people die each year from diarrheal diseases, of which 90%
are children under 5. Over 88% of the diarrheal disease
is waterborne or water-related (http://www.who.int/
water_sanitation_health/publications/facts2004/en/index.
html). Throughout human history, the safety of drinking and
recreation water has been an ongoing challenge. Dr Lee Jongwook, Director-General of WHO, stated “Water and sanitation
is one of the primary drivers of public health.”
Waterborne disease is not restricted to developing countries. The outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in 1993 in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, provides a good example (1). More recent bacterial
outbreaks have involved E. coli O157:H7, the most serious
of which occurred in Walkerton, Ontario Canada in the spring
of 2000 and resulted in six deaths and over 2300 cases (BruceGrey-Owen Sound Health Unit, 2000, http://
enve.coe.drexel.edu/outbreaks/WalkertonReportOct2000/
REPORT_Oct00.PDF). Morris and Levine (2) attempted to
estimate the annual waterborne disease burden in the U.S.
and indicated that a significantly greater number of people
suffer from a mild to moderate waterborne infection each
year than statistical reports indicate. Payment (3, 4) agrees
that if their figures are overestimated, both the health and
economic burden are considerable for an industrialized
society and a developing nation.
To reduce human health risk from waterborne and waterrelated illness, water quality standards are established by
WHO and are adapted by most nations worldwide. Monitor† This critical review is part of the Emerging Contaminants Special
Issue.

ing programs are conducted locally to meet water quality
criteria. Total coliform, fecal coliform (or E. coli), and
enterococcus are the most commonly used indicators for
microbial water quality and human health risk assessment.
However, the adequacy of these indicator bacteria to indicate
the occurrence and concentration of human viruses and
protozoa cysts has been questioned in recent years, because
of their morphological and physiochemical differences from
indicator bacteria. Viruses are significantly smaller, which
can escape the filtration barriers designed to remove bacteria.
Viruses and protozoa cysts have also been shown to be more
resistant to wastewater treatment process and environmental
degradation conditions than traditional indicator bacteria
(see reviews (5-7). To prevent these potential human health
threats, the U.S. has recently amended the Safe Drinking
Water Act, which requires the Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) to publish a list of unregulated contaminants
and contaminant groups every 5 years that are known or
anticipated to occur in public water systems, and which may
require regulation. This list, the Drinking Water Contaminant
Candidate List, commonly referred to as the CCL, will provide
the basis for a mandated EPA decision to regulate (or not)
at least five new contaminants every 5 years. Human
adenovirus (Ad), one of the nine microbes on the current
CCL, is considered an emerging contaminant in drinking
water. These viruses are more resistant to UV disinfection
than other human enteric viruses in almost all cases (8).
They have also been found in river and coastal waters,
swimming pools, and finished drinking waters worldwide
(Table 4-6). Health outcomes attributed to Ads infection
include both enteric related illnesses and respiratory system
and eye infections (9). Adenovirus infection also emerges as
a fatal outcome for immunocompromised patients and organ
and bone marrow transplant recipients (10).

Biology and Epidemiology of Human Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses are members of the Adenoviridae family, which
comprises five genera and infects hosts across the broad
spectrum of vertebrates (11-13). Human Ad, genus Mastadenovirus, is a double stranded DNA virus; it has a noneneveloped icosahedral shell with fiber-like projections from
each of the 12 vertices (14). The shell is approximately 90100 nm in diameter. Its linear double-stranded DNA of about
35 kilobases in most serotypes encodes more than 30
structural and non-structural proteins (15). The first of over
51 currently recognized distinct Ad serotypes was first isolated
in 1953 from human adenoid tissue and named for the tissue
of origin (16). The 51 serotypes are divided into six species
based on their hemeagglutination properties, their oncogenic
potential in rodents and DNA homology or GC content of
their DNA. There is some clinical significance to the classification scheme, as certain organ specificity and disease
patterns appear to cluster within the six subgroups (Table
1).

Adenovirus infection results in a broad spectrum of clinical
presentation. Although many Ads can replicate in the
intestine and shed in feces, Ad40 and Ad41 of subgroup F are
unique in being responsible for most cases of Ad-associated
gastroenteritis in children. Adenovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 5
are responsible for 5-10% of childhood respiratory diseases,
which are mostly self-limiting (17). These viruses also cause
conjunctivitis in healthy adults (18) and certain serotypes
can cause keratitis (19). Haemorrhagic cystitis by Ad11 may
occur in normal hosts (20) but this self-limiting disease can
be more serious in immunocompromised patients.
After a primary infection, lifelong immunity is conferred
for the specific causative serotype. Hence adults are more
susceptible to infections by Ad3, Ad4, and Ad7 that are less
commonly seen in children (21). After acute infection, some
Ad types (1, 2, and 5) may be shed in stool for months to
years, and this is probably responsible for the endemic spread
to other susceptible groups via the fecal-oral route. Inhalation
of aerosolized droplets contaminated with Ad has also been
shown to be an important pathway for Ad infection (22). The
recovered patients can serve as carriers of the viruses for
extended periods of time. Alternately, some infections may
persist in a latent phase in tissues such as tonsils, adenoids,
intestine, and the urinary tract for life (23).
Outbreaks of Ad infection have been described in day
care centers, hospitals, military quarters (24), and swimming
pools. The first water-related outbreak of Ad infection was
reported during the summer of 1977 (25). An outbreak of
pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) occurred at a private
recreational facility in Georgia. A total of 72 cases were
attributed to Ad4. The virus was also recovered from water
obtained from the swimming pool at the facility on different
dates (25). Serotype 7a and 3 were also reported to associate
with swimming pool related Ads outbreaks (26-28). The more
recent water-related outbreak is reported from Greece in
July 1995. At least 80 athletes participating in a swimming
contest displayed symptoms of pharyngoconjuctivitis, with
the predominant symptoms being high fever, sore throat,
conjuctivitis, headache, and abdominal pain. Adenoviruses
were detected in swimming pool water by nested polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification (29), but the serotype of
the virus was not identified.
The only waterborne enteric disease outbreak that is
attributed to Ads was reported in a Finnish municipality in
April 1994. Some 1500-3000 people had symptomatic acute
gastroenteritis. Laboratory findings confirmed Ads, norovirus,
small round viruses (SRV), and group A and C rotaviruses as
causative agents. Norovirus was considered the main cause
of the outbreak (30). Thus, the role of Ads in the outbreak
is inconclusive since enteric Ads infections are mostly
asymptomatic among adults due to endemic illness cases
and establishment of immunity to this virus. They may
manifest as day care center and hospital outbreaks due to
the high number of susceptible population in these environments.

Detection of Adenoviruses in the Aquatic Environment
In addition to supporting the mandated development of
drinking water regulations, CCL is intended to be the source
of priority contaminants for the EPA’s drinking water program
as a whole, including research, monitoring, and guidance
development. Current virus monitoring methods, according
to USEPA Information Collection Rule (ICR), are based on
the total culturable virus assay enumerated by mostprobable-number (TCVA-MPN) on buffalo green monkey
kidney (BGMK) cells. However, the adequacy of this method
for assaying human Ads in water requires review and
assessment.
Techniques that are applicable for Ads detection in aquatic
environments are not significantly different from those used
for clinical diagnosis. In fact, most of the methods for
environmental virology have been adapted from their clinical
applications. The challenge that is unique to environmental
virologists is the generally low concentration of target viruses
in aquatic samples. A viral concentration step is necessary
before target detection can be achieved. In addition, the
sensitivity of the test is critical to identify the target. Electron
microscopy and commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIA)
are sensitive enough to detect the large number of viruses
in acute-phase stool specimens (approximately 106 virus
particles/g). However, these techniques are not sensitive
enough to detect low numbers of viral particles in large
volumes of water.
Another challenge for environmental virologists is the
complexity of the environmental matrices. Toxic metals,
humic, and fulvic acid associated with sewage, river, and
coastal waters can be either toxic for tissue culture cell lines
or inhibitory for PCR reactions. Thus, sample purification is
necessary after concentration to reduce the cytotoxic or
inhibitory effect. However, there is a trade off between
multiple purification steps needed to remove toxicity/
inhibitors and the recovery rate of target viral particles or
viral nucleic acid. Figure 1 shows generic steps involved for
detection of Ads in aquatic samples. The concentration and
purification procedures required for Ads are not different
from other enteric viruses assay procedures in water samples.
Information on these procedures can be found in recent
reviews by Griffin et al. (31) and Lipp et al. (32), therefore,
they will not be repeated here. Below, only the detection
techniques that are specific to Ads are reviewed.

only USEPA approved method for virus monitoring in the
aquatic samples and the only method for virus detection
before the age of molecular biology and PCR technology.

cell lines including BGMK, Caco-2, HeLa, Hep-2, KB (human
oral epidermoid), A549, PLC/PRF/5, and 293 human embryonal kidney (HEK). However, the efficiency of replication
on tissue cultures varies with serotypes. The enteric Ad
serotype 40 and 41 are very slow growing and produce little
or no cytopathic effect (CPE) on most cell lines. Ad40 cannot
be passaged in HeLa cells. Mautner et al. (33) showed that
only cell lines expressing Ad E1A and that supply Ad E1B
functions are permissive for Ad40. HEK Graham 293 is a
permanent line of HEK transformed by sheared human Ad
type 5 (Ad5) DNA. The cells express the transformed genes
of Ad5 including E1A and E1B functions (34). For this reason,
Graham 293 cells may be used for propagation of Ad40 and
Ad41.
A number of studies have been done to evaluate the
efficiency of various tissue culture cell lines in support of
Ads replication. These reports are summarized in Table 2.
The susceptibility of the cell lines may vary slightly depend
on the sample source and the researcher performing the
test, but the literature generally agrees that 293, A549, PLC/
PRF/5, and Caco-2 performed better for Ads than BGMK, the
USEPA recommended cell line for water monitoring. A review
of current literature on Ads detection in aquatic environments
indicates that BGMK was most often the tissue culture of
choice (35-39). Thus, the occurrence of Ads in the aquatic
environment may be underestimated using EPA ICR, especially for the fastidious Ad40 and 41.
In addition to the issue of susceptibility, one other
shortcoming of tissue-culture-based detection is the long
lag time required for conclusive results. To accelerate the
speed of detection and confirmation, immunofluorescence
staining with genus-specific monoclonal antibodies was used
(40). Van Doornum et al. (41) reported detection of Ads in
567 clinical specimens with significantly shortened detection
time for most samples. This technology was later developed
into a commercial Ads diagnostic kit called Adenovirus Direct
Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA) by Chemicon Corp. However, the immunofluoresecent based method has not been
applied to aquatic samples.
Molecular-Biology-Based Assay. The advancement of
genome based technologies, especially the application of
PCR methods, for the detection of Ads has significantly
shortened the detection time and improved the sensitivity
of detection. Genomic methods target the unique and
conservative gene sequences in the Ads genome. Gene
sequences targeted so far include those coding for the hexon
protein, fiber protein, and DNA polymerase of the virus. Many
primers and probes for single step PCR, nested-PCR,
multiplex PCR, and real-time PCR have been published in
recent years. Table 3 lists PCR primers and probes that have
been used for Ads detection in aquatic samples. Primers and
probes designed and tested for clinical diagnoses, including
for subtyping and serotyping (i.e., refs 42-46), are also likely
to work for detecting and quantifying Ads in water samples

A549 performed better
A549 performed better

if adequate sample concentration and viral purification
methods are applied.
Among all primers and probes reported, those designed
by Allard et al. (47, 48) for nested-PCR were the most widely
used for environmental applications (35, 37-39, 49-59).
Evaluation of these primers using 47 different Ad serotypes
yielded positive detection for all types (51). However, there
are mismatches of nucleotide sequences between these
primers and different Ad serotypes in the NCBI database.
Nearly 10 years later, Xu et al. (42) reported the design of
degenerate primers for all Ad serotypes, which was later
adapted by Ko et al. (60) for environmental applications.
Likewise, other degenerate primers original tested for clinical
applications (i.e. refs 61, 62) were successfully adapted and
applied to the environmental samples (63, 64). All primers
for Ads detection in aquatic samples target the Ad hexon
gene because of the conservative nature of this gene among
diverse serotypes of Ads. The sensitivity of PCR is generally
close to 1 plaque forming unit (PFU) or less based on seeding
study (i.e., refs 47, 48, 52). However, the sensitivity of the
PCR can be significantly reduced in the presence of PCR
inhibitors from the aquatic samples (65). Improvement in
nucleic acid purification technology from environmental
matrix is a universal challenge facing all environmental
researchers.
Although the improved speed and sensitivity for Ads
detection using PCR methods is a significant technological
achievement, presence/absence information obtained from
the traditional PCR assays alone often offers little or noinformation on public health risk associated with exposure
to contaminated waters. Information on the quantity and
infectivity of viruses are critical for health risk assessment.
The desire for quantitative technology has driven the
development and application of quantitative real-time PCR
(QPCR) in environmental samples. Four recent articles have
reported the primers and probes that are applicable to the
quantification of Ads in environmental samples. The primers
and probes for QPCR are either partially based on previous
published PCR primers (64, 66, 67), or are redesigned to
capture specific serotype of Ad (65). The sensitivity of QPCR
is shown to be similar to nested PCR or slightly lower (65).
QPCR relay on a standard curve established using the known
genome numbers to calibrate the unknown samples. Viral
genome equivalence is generally orders of magnitude greater
than PFU (9), thus the sensitivity of QPCR is generally in the
range of 10-50 genome equivalence or 10-1 to 10-3 PFU
(67). Standard curves are commonly established by seeding
titrated genome copies into sterilized water and reagents,
thus they are unequivocal to environmental samples where
PCR inhibitors may be present. Jiang et al. (65) has shown
that the QPCR efficiency reduces to 60% when seed in
seawater and to 30% in secondary sewage effluent in
comparison with seeding in sterilized water. Thus, the
accuracy of QPCR for aquatic samples, as in PCR assay, is

largely relay on nucleic acid purification technology. Sometimes a simple dilution in sterilized water will improve the
PCR sensitivity by diluting out the inhibitors. In the absence
of 100% satisfying nucleic acid purification methods, the
QPCR yields the conservative estimates of the quantity of
Ads in the aquatic samples.
PCR methods, like many other genome-based techniques,
report the presence of genetic material of the target organism,
but offer no information on the viability and infectivity of
the organism. Many argue that PCR-positive results have
little or no public health significance in terms of the microbial
quality of the water because viruses inactivated by chlorination have also been detectable by PCR (68). Choi et al. (69)
has shown that the high genome prevalence of Ads detected
by QPCR in Southern California urban rivers are non
infectious on tissue culture. One possible approach that
addresses this issue is integrated cell culture PCR (ICC-PCR).
ICC-PCR combines the sensitivity of PCR and the ability of
tissue culture to amplify infectious viral particle present in
the water samples. Chapron et al. (35) reported detection of
Ads in water combining BGMK tissue culture with nestedPCR, and showed significant improvement of sensitivity from
the EPA-required TCVA-MPN method and shortened the
detection time from 14 days to 3 days. Interestingly, the Ad
detected in this study is Ad40, which is generally fastidious
in BGMK cell line. Similar research conducted by Greening
et al. (57) showed that using A549 to replace BGMK can further
improve the sensitivity of ICC-PCR. Lee et al. (70) advocate
use multiple cell lines for ICC-PCR to improve the spectrum
of human viruses that are detectable by the method. To
address the issue of potential carry over of non-infectious
Ad viral DNA in the tissue culture, Ko et al. (60) developed
a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method that targets the
mRNA transcribed during the tissue culture assay to demonstrate the occurrence of true infectious viruses.

possum, platypus, antechinus, wood duck, rat, wild pig, fox,
rabbit, goat, deer, carp (Cyprinus carpio), and ferry cat (Felis
catus)swere all negative for human Ads (71). Human waste
has been the only known source of human Ads. Human Ads
have been found in high concentrations in domestic sewage
collected worldwide (51, 52, 56, 72-76). The occurrence and
concentration of human Ads in sewage also have little
seasonal variability (52). Therefore, the occurrence of human
Ads in the natural aquatic environment is likely due to the
contamination with untreated or inefficiently treated human
sewage.
Studies have shown that Ads and especially Ad40 and 41
survive longer than fecal indicator bacteria in sewage and
the environment (77) and are very resistant to UV light (8).
This increased UV resistance showed by Ads may be
associated with the double stranded nature of their DNA
genome, which if damaged, may be repaired by the host cell
DNA-repair mechanisms (78). Thus, Ads may be discharged
to the environment with sewage effluent that meet bacterial
indicator standard. Chlorination seems to be the only effective
method to disinfect Ads (79).
Occurrence in Fresh and Coastal Waters. Early detection
of Ads in the aquatic environment was achieved by tissue
culture and was reported in PFU (Table 4). For example,
Tani et al. (80, 81) reported the occurrence of Ads in the river
of Nara Prefecture, Japan and showed that infectious Ads
occurred at low level throughout the years. Grohmann et al.
(82) showed that approximately 12% of the 202 river water,
9-24% of coastal water and 10-25% of the stormwater were
contaminated with human viruses including Ads in Sydney,
Australia.
The number of reports on the occurrence of Ads in river
and coastal waters escalated over the recent years owing to
the advent of PCR technology and the increased awareness
of this emerging pathogen in the environment. These reports
are summarized chronologically in Table 4. High frequencies

of Ads detection in surface waters used for drinking water
supplies have also been reported in South Korea and South
Africa. Interestingly, data from these two regions also
suggested that the Ads detected are infectious, in contrast
with reports from New Zealand (57) and Southern California
(69). The New Zealand report showed that PCR positive
samples are negative by ICC-PCR (57); the Southern California
study reported high prevalence of Ads by QPCR but negative
results on the 293A tissue culture cell line (69).

Occurrence in Swimming Pool Water. The reports of
Ads in swimming pool water predated the studies of Ads in
river and coastal waters (Table 5). These early investigations
were motivated by disease outbreaks associated with exposure to the pool water. The first report of Ads in swimming
pool waters was in a private recreational facility in Georgia
in 1977 (25). Adenovirus serotype 4 was isolated from the
concentrated pool water. Detection and isolation of Ads were
also reported in 1980 and 1987 in both community and private

swimming pools (26, 27) and from a swimming pond that
was used for summer-camp recreation in North Carolina
(83). In most cases, the disease outbreaks were attributed to
the low chlorine residual in water. More recently, Van
Heerden et al. (84) showed that Ads were prevalent in both
indoor and outdoor pools in South Africa, where there was
no report of disease outbreak. The risk of infection from the
pool water was estimated to be between 2 and 4 per 1000
swimmers (84).
Occurrence in Drinking Water. The occurrence of Ads
in finished drinking water and tap water has been reported
in South Korea and South Africa (Table 6). Cho et al. (37) first
reported that all four tap water samples collected in South
Korea tested positive for Ads by RT-multiplex-nested PCR.
Sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of Ad40, 41,
and 5. Using nested-PCR method, Grabow et al. (85) reported
the detection of Ads in 4% of 413 finished drinking water
tested in South Africa. This study was followed by three
additional reports from the same group of researchers
showing Ads in 4% of 204 to 30% of 198 finished drinking
water and tap water tested in South Africa (63, 64, 86).
Surprisingly, this detection frequency is higher than reports
of Ads in river and coastal waters from many other regions.
Similarly, in South Korea, surprisingly high frequency of Ads
detection was reported in finished drinking water and tap
waters (38, 39, 58). Lee et al. (58) showed that infectious Ads
were found in 39% of 23 tap water samples that were negative
for coliform bacteria. However, there are also discrepancies
among different reports from South Korea. For example, Lee
et al. (38) reported 28% of 50 tap water samples were positive
by ICC-multiplex-nested PCR and 16% positive by tissue
culture assay. Conversely, another group of researchers from
South Korea reported negative detection of Ads by tissue
culture, but positive detection by ICC-nested-PCR (58). These
discrepancies may be due to the differences in tissue culture
cell lines used or the cell line condition. Nevertheless, such
high frequency of infectious Ads detection in drinking water
from these two regions is alarming. However, there has not
been any documented waterborne Ads outbreak in South
Africa or South Korea.
Risk based analyses using a rate of Ads occurrence of
1/100-1/1000 L in drinking water indicates an illness rate
between 8.3/1000 and 8.3/10 000 in drinking water (87). This
estimated illness rate is below our current definition of
waterborne outbreak. However, the estimated risk for Ads
infection due to drinking water is significantly higher in South
Africa, falls between 10/100 and 17/100. This level of risk is
within the definition of outbreak and should have been
observed and reported if a good illness surveillance system
existed. Alternatively, the infection and immunity of Ads
might not fit the traditional model of waterborne outbreaks.

4.4% of 205 to 29.8% of 198 samples
were positive, specie D dominate
39.1% of 23 samples were positive for Ads;
negative for coliform bacteria, Ad40, 41 and 5
were identified by sequence analysis
negative for culture assay,
positive for ICC-nested PCR
16% of 50 samples were positive by
tissue culture; 28% of 50 samples
were positive ICC-PCR

The persistent low level of exposure to Ads in water may
result in the endemic cases of Ads infection and establishment
of immunity against the virus, which prevent the large scale
outbreak of disease.

Final Remarks
In the past 20 years, we have witnessed the rapid development
of pathogen detection technologies in water. Examination
of current methods for virus detection as required by USEPA
ICR suggests that they are not optimal at detecting human
Ads in the aquatic samples. A method that combines the
newest molecular biological technique with improved infectivity assay is necessary to accurately assay the occurrence
of Ads in the water. Streamline of experimental protocols,
standardize assay methods, and development of testing kits
are also necessary before these technologies are practical for
routine water quality testing and public health protection.
Furthermore, these new technologies are currently expensive,
and therefore, unlikely to be practical in underdeveloped
regions of the world, where water quality problems are most
urgent. Research that leads to a better understanding of the
physical and biological property of Ads and their survival
and transport characteristics in the environment should be
a priority in order to develop strategies to eliminate this and
other viral pathogens from drinking and recreation waters
in both developing and developed nations.
It is also interesting to note that non-enteric Ads outbreaks
are mostly reported from more developed countries including
U.S., Greece, and Australia. However, little work has been
done in these countries to test for Ads in swimming pool
water other than those associated with disease outbreaks.
Furthermore, the past epidemiological data point the public
health significance of both enteric and non-enteric Ads. So
far, there has not been an indicator for non-enteric related
illness in recreational water. Adenovirus, with its prevalent
association with human sewage, human waste specificity,
environmental stability, and resistance to water treatment
processes, perhaps can serve as a conservative indicator for
assessing viral quality and efficacy of water treatment
processes. It can also be used as one of the indicators to
distinguish human waste contamination from fecal waste of
non-human origin. Moreover, an epidemiological investigation in drinking and recreational waters may be necessary
to include viral indicators such as Ads in addition to
traditional fecal indicator bacteria in order to understand
the link between human health risk and the occurrence of
human viral pathogens.
