Abstract
Electric bidet toilets are widely used in Japan and are sanitary devices, that are integral to daily life. Approximately, half of the population washed the anus before or after defecation. Cleaning the anus after
defecation using the bidets contributes to hand hygiene and local comfort, and it may be effective against
constipation. However, excessive bidet use potentially causes anal pruritus and anal incontinence (AI). Physicians are advised to instruct patients with anal pruritus to avoid excessive cleaning of the anus and those
with AI to discontinue bidet use. For the estimation of the inherent severity of AI, physicians should instruct a bidet user with AI to discontinue bidet use and assess the severity of AI later. Additionally, the nozzle surface and splay water of bidet toilets may be contaminated with fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, rendering them a
potential vehicle for cross-infection. In the hospital setting, compromised patients must be cautious regarding the shared use of bidet toilets to prevent infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Specifically, they
should be provided with bidet toilets exclusive for them or may need to be instructed to not use a bidet.

Introduction
Electric bidet toilets are automatic devices that deliver a
jet of water to clean the anus after defecation. Ever since
their introduction to the Japanese market in 1967, Japanesemanufactured electric bidet toilets have steadily gained
popularity. According to the Cabinet Office’s Consumer
Trend Survey[1], the diffusion rate of bidet toilets in households was 80.2% in March 2020, and the number of these
units owned per 100 households was 114.5, which is more
than one per household (Figure 1)[2]. Bidets have been developed to incorporate different functions to improve user
comfort. Presently, users can select their preferred force,
thickness (narrow or wide), and temperature of the water jet.
Bidet toilets are installed not only in general households but
also in public facilities such as commercial buildings, hotels,

airports, and hospitals, and have emerged as a sanitary device that is integral to daily life in Japan.
Notwithstanding, anal symptoms associated with the inappropriate use of bidet toilets and nosocomial infections
caused by using these units have been reported. Thus, physicians are advised to reemphasize the appropriate use of bidet toilets. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no
published comprehensive report focusing on issues related to
bidet toilet use. In this review, we describe the advantages,
current status, and issues regarding the use of bidet toilets.
No approval from any IRB was required because this review article was based on previously published papers.

hygiene. Oie et al.[3] conducted a simulation experiment to
examine hand contamination from wiping the buttocks after
the use and non-use of an electric bidet toilet with splay
water. A model of the buttocks was smeared with an artificial liquid stool containing Serratia marcescens and wiped
by the participants with toilet paper after the use or non-use
of the splay water. The number of bacteria adhering to the
hand was significantly lower when the splay water was used
before wiping the artificial liquid stool. This finding corroborates the effectiveness of splay water in preventing
defecation-related hand contamination.
A positive effect on toileting has also been highlighted.
When women aged 75 years or older were asked to use bidet toilets in a nursing home, approximately 50% of them
reported a sense of comfort and cleanliness after defecation[4]. The usefulness of bidet use against constipation or
defecation difficulties has also been reported. -Uchikawa et
al.[5] discovered that the use of bidets induced defecation in
15/20 (75%) patients with spinal cord injury. In a study by
Shigematsu et al.[6] of 18 patients who had undergone hysterectomy, 15 (83%) of the patients reported smooth bowel
movement during the postoperative period when using the
bidet toilets. In a study of pregnant women in Turkey, the
group that washed their anus before defecation reported a
significant improvement in constipation scores compared
with the control group, despite not using electric bidet toilets[7].
Regarding the anorectal physiological benefits, Ryoo et
al.[8] found that bidet use at low or medium water jet pressure, at a warm temperature, and with a wide-type water jet
potentially reduce anal pressure with an effect resembling

that of a warm sitz bath. The authors suggested that the effect of relaxing anal sphincter pressure may be beneficial to
patients with elevated anal pressures due to anorectal diseases, such as an anal fissure or hemorrhoids, and during
postoperative periods after surgery for anal diseases. Watanabe et al.[9] reported that bidet use at a warm temperature
for 10 min increased blood flow in the submucosa of the
anus, which potentially contributes to postoperative wound
healing.

Current Use of Bidet Toilets
Previously, we conducted a survey of electric bidet use
among Japanese community-dwelling residents and found
that 55% (2,724/4,952) of the respondents washed the anus
either before or after defecation[10]. Additionally, at least
30% (828/2,724) of bidet users washed before defecation,
and 70% of the respondents reported “Because it aids defecation by stimulating the anus with a jet of water,” and 20%
reported “Because it aids defecation like an enema when
water penetrates the rectum.” In a survey of bidet use in 575
outpatients conducted by Yano et al.[11], 349 (61%) washed
the anus at every defecation and 75 (13%) did so occasionally. Among the 424 bidet users, 392 (93%) reported that
this was for anal cleanliness and 111 (26%) reported that
this eased defecation. In a survey of college students, 34%
(47/139) of the female students and 44% (43/98) of their
male counterparts reported using the washing function of bidet toilets[12]. Overall, approximately half of the population
washed the anus before or after defecation.

A previous study reported 10 cases of anterior fissures
due to bidet toilet use for 1-5 min[16]. The author speculated that the stronger water pressure of the bidet use with a
longer duration may be the causative factor of the anterior
fissure.

Bidet Toilet Use and Anal Symptoms
1）Anal pruritus
Excessive bidet use may cause itching of the anus[13].
Kurokawa et al.[14] reported that perianal dermatitis found
in 932/3,541 (26%) patients was due to excessive bidet use.
In our surveillance, the incidence of respondents who complained of anal pruritus was 14% (345/2,449), and multivariate analysis of the risk factors showed that the correlates for
anal itching included the active use of bidet toilets, such as
washing before defecation, and using relatively warm water
for washing the anus[10]. The pathophysiology underlying
anal pruritus is the shedding of sebum around the anus due
to excessive bidet toilet use, leading to skin dryness[13].
2）Anal incontinence
In our surveillance, 6% (156/2,534) of the respondents
experienced fecal incontinence at least once a month after
using bidets[10]. In another study that investigated the relationship between AI (defined as incontinence to gas, mucus,
or feces) and bidet use, 49 patients with AI who had habitually used bidets were asked to discontinue bidet use for a
median of 4 weeks. Consequently, both the AI score (Figure
2) and the frequency of fecal incontinence were significantly
lower at follow-up than at baseline[15]. Although the causes
of AI are multifactorial, it is possible that when patients
wash the anus using a bidet, water may penetrate the rectum, especially in those with a lax anal sphincter. Enemas
induce the defecation reflex and increase bowel peristalsis
with water streaming into the rectum, thereby resulting in
post-defecation AI symptoms.

Outbreaks of resistant bacteria have been reported to be
due to the contamination of the cleaning nozzles of bidet
toilets in hospitals[17-19]. In each case, the outbreaks were
reportedly due to bidet use by patients in the hematology
department, and it is speculated that antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria attached to the nozzles spread to other patients
through the splay water. According to the outbreak of drugresistant bacteria in the hematology unit, Enterobacter cloacae producing metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) infection was
found in16 (5 males and 11 females) patients[17] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing MBL infection was found in
24 (18 males and 6 females) patients[18].
Iyo et al.[20] investigated the actual status of bacterial
contamination of water storage-type bidet toilets installed on
university campuses and found that Escherichia coli and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected at frequencies of
2.4% (3/127) and 1.6% (2/127), respectively, in the splay
water. It is inferred that fecal indicator bacteria attached to
the nozzle surface and around the water discharge hole were
mixed with the splay water and detected. The heterotrophic
bacteria in the splay water proliferated significantly more
than those in the tap water. This might have been because
the heterotrophic bacteria in the tap water proliferated in the
water storage tank and nozzle piping as the residual chlorine
concentration decreased because of heating of the water
storage tank[20,21]. We have also reported similar findings
regarding the remarkable growth of heterotrophic bacteria in
the splay water of bidet toilets[22].
Regarding the detection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
recovered from water storage-type bidet toilets, a survey of
292 toilets installed at a university hospital in Japan detected
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extendedspectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli contamination on the nozzle surface[23]. We also conducted a similar
study on 192 water storage-type bidet toilets installed in a
district hospital and found that E. coli was detected in five
(2.6%) of the nozzle surfaces and in the splay water of four
(2.1%) of the bidet toilets, and ESBL-producing E. coli was
recovered in one sample each (Table 1)[22].

mary cause of anal symptoms. Sasaki et al.[13] discouraged
excessive anal washing and the use of topical steroids for
anal pruritus and reported that 94 patients with the disease
were treated according to the treatment plan, and all (100%)
recovered successfully. This treatment plan is quite reasonable. In the present writer’s clinic, anal cleaning is specifically restricted to less than 5 s with weak water pressure
and a wide water jet, because a strong water pressure or a
thin water jet may feel harder and more stimulating at the
anus. Patients with AI are instructed to discontinue washing
to prevent the splay water from penetrating the rectum. Conversely, when researchers estimate the severity of AI using
the AI score, they should check whether a patient with AI is
a bidet user or not. If the patient uses a bidet, instead of
treating AI immediately, the patient should be instructed to
discontinue bidet use for a certain period of time and the severity of AI should be assessed again later.
To prevent infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria,
not only patients with hematological malignancies but also
compromised hosts, such as patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease, terminal cancer, and those receiving
hemodialysis, must be cautious in the shared use of bidet
toilets. Specifically, they should be provided with bidet toilets exclusive for them or may need to be instructed to not
to use a bidet. Additionally, the appropriate cleaning method
for bidet toilets, including the nozzle or the service life of
these units, must be considered. Recently, an on-demand
type of bidet toilet with a nozzle cleaning mechanism that
uses electrolyzed hypochlorite water, has been devised to replace the water storage-type bidet toilets; however, in the
nozzle-contamination test, E. coli in the splay water was
sterilized, whereas P. aeruginosa was not completely sterilized[24].

Conclusion
The current status and issues regarding the use of bidet
toilets were reviewed. The bidet toilet is the most widely
used toilet in Japan, and approximately half the population
washes the anus before or after defecation. Excessive bidet
use should be considered an etiologic factor in patients undergoing a medical examination for anal pruritus or AI. In
the hospital setting, compromised patients should be cautious regarding the shared use of bidet toilets to prevent infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Further studies
are required to confirm the issues surrounding bidet toilet
use.
Coronavirus disease 2019 has been prevalent since 2020,
and the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 has reportedly been detected in the stool or urine of patients affected by this disease[25]. Consequently, the cleaning of bidet toilets (including the nozzles) that are installed
in hospital rooms dedicated to this disease must be prioritized.
