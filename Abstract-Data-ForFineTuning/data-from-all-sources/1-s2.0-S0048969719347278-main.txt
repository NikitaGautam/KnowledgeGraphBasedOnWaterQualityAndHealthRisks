a b s t r a c t
Considerable number of studies have been carried out to develop and apply various substrate materials
for constructed wetlands (CWs), however, there is a lack of method and model for comprehensive
evaluation of different types of CWs substrates. To this end, this article summarized nearly all the substrate materials of CWs available in the literatures, including natural materials, agricultural/industrial
wastes and artificial materials. The sources and physicochemical properties of various substrate materials, as well as their removal capacities for main water contaminants including nutrients, heavy metals,
surfactants, pesticides/herbicides, emerging contaminants and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were comprehensively described. Further, a scoring model for the substrate evaluation was constructed based
on likely cost, availability, permeability, reuse and contaminant removal capacities, which can be used
to select the most suitable substrate material for different considerations. The provided information
and constructed model contribute to better understanding of CWs substrate for readers, and help solve
practical problems on substrates selection and CWs construction.

1. Introduction
Constructed wetlands (CWs) are green and engineered wastewater treatment systems, which are designed and constructed to utilize the natural purification processes involving wetland plants,
substrates and the associated microbes (Cheng et al., 2018). In
1953, Dr. Käthe Seidel from the Max-Planck Institute of Germany
reported the ability of aquatic plants in artificial wetlands to
absorb and decompose chemical contaminants, which is the starting point for CWs research (Vymazal, 2011). Since 1990s, a significant progress has been made on the CWs technology by scientists
and researchers, and CWs have become international and been
widely adopted around the world (Vymazal, 2011). Nowadays,
the United States has built more than 10,000 CWs sewage treatment systems, Europe has built more than 8000 CWs, and China
has built 425 CWs (Zhang et al., 2012). In addition to the initial
application in treatments of domestic wastewater (Kivaisi, 2001)
and acid mine wastewater (Wieder, 1989), CWs have extended to
be used in purifications of agricultural effluents (Wood et al.,
2007), tile drainage waters (Kynkäänniemi et al., 2013), and industrial effluents (Mbuligwe, 2005).
According to the wetland hydrology, CWs are typically classified into three types: surface flow (SF) CWs, subsurface flow
(SSF) CWs and hybrid systems (Tilley et al., 2014). SF CWs are
similar to natural wetlands, with shallow flow of wastewater over
substrates (Fig. 1a). In SSF systems, wastewater flows through the
substrates, and based on the flow direction, SSF CWs could be
further divided into horizontal flow (HF) and vertical flow (VF)
CWs (Wu et al., 2015). In HF CWs, the wastewater flows horizontally through the substrates under the surface of the bed planted
with macrophytes (e.g., Common reed) (Fig. 1b). The lack of oxygen
in HF CWs facilitates the bacterial decomposition of organics in

anaerobic conditions (Brix, 1990) and denitrification process
(Kröpfelová, 2008), but suppresses the oxidation of ammonia
and hence nitrification process (Vymazal, 2011). In VF CWs,
wastewater flows longitudinally from the surface into the bottom
of the bed planted with macrophytes (Fig. 1c). The intermittent
bed draining allows air to refill the bed and provides greater oxygen transfer into the bed, thus producing a strong ability of nitrification (Cooper et al., 1996). However, the denitrification is
relativley limited in VF CWs process. To achieve a higher removal
efficiency of contaminants, especially for nitrogen, various types
of CWs may be combined to form hybrid systems (Hoffmann
et al., 2011).
Substrates are indispensable parts of CWs, and most of the
physical, chemical and biological reactions are carried out in substrates (Yang et al., 2018a). The substrates not only support the
growth of wetland plants and provide attachments for biofilms,
but also play a significant role in contaminant removal (Wu
et al., 2015). The substrate purification mechanisms include physical sedimentation and filtration (Wood, 1995), sorption and burial
in substrate matrix (Daneshvar et al., 2017), complexation and precipitation by colloid composition (Kröpfelová et al., 2009), ion
exchange (Matagi et al., 1998), gas diffusion in the substrate gap
(Vymazal et al., 1998), microbial degradation, transformation and
bio-immobilization in the substrate (Stottmeister et al., 2003),
and uptake and metabolism by plant root in the substrate (Brix,
1997).
A variety of materials could be used as substrates for CWs,
including natural materials (e.g., gravel and sand), agricultural/
industrial wastes (e.g., oyster shell and fly ash) and artificial materials (e.g., activate carbon and ceramsite) (Cheng et al., 2018), and
different materials possess different characteristics. Natural
materials are materials in nature that can be directly used without

processing or basically without processing. Agricultural waste
refers to the waste discharged from agricultural production, processing of agricultural products, rural residents’ lives and animal
husbandry. Industrial waste refers to solid, semi-solid, liquid and
gaseous particles and substances that are released in the industrial
production activities or that have been discarded or abandoned.

Artificial materials are made from natural and/or waste materials
and usually have the characteristic of recyclability.
Substrate selection is one of the key issues in CWs wastewater
treatment (Yang et al., 2018a), and suitable substrates can effectively remove various pollutants, and avoid clogging and improve
operation cycle. Problems to be considered for the selection of sub-

strate materials include their source and cost, hydraulic and engineering feasibility, ability to remove contaminants, support for
plant growth and microbial adhesion, safety (secondary pollution),
substrate plugging, substrate life, and recovery and disposal issues
of exhaustion substrate, etc. (Fig. 2). Just because of so many problems to consider, the choice of substrate has become a confusing
issue for scientists and engineers.
In response to the above problems, it is necessary to find a good
method of substrate selection. Therefore, this article reviewed the
sources and physicochemical properties of various substrate materials, as well as their removal capacities for main water contaminants including nutrients, heavy metals, surfactants, pesticides/
herbicides, emerging contaminants and fecal indicator bacteria
(FIB). Further, a scoring model for the substrate evaluation was
constructed based on likely cost, availability, reuse and contaminant removal capacities, which can be used to select the most suitable substrate for different considerations. The overall goal of this
work was to provide a simpler, faster, scientific and reliable reference for the selection of substrates in CWs with different purposes.
2. Substrate materials
2.1. Natural materials
2.1.1. Gravel
Gravel is a rock fragment whose particle size is larger than
2 mm and smaller than a single soil, and the main chemical compositions are SiO2 and Al2O3. A large number of studies have shown
that the existence of gravel in the soil will not only affect the surface roughness and soil physical properties (soil bulk density, soil
porosity, soil water conductivity, soil moisture content), but also
affect the soil infiltration characteristics. Gravelly soils are widely
distributed in the world, and they are relatively easy to obtain, safe
and non-polluting. In addition, gravel possesses high permeability
with permeability coefficient of 3  10 4–3  10 2 m/s.
Many studies suggested that gravel had worse P adsorption
capacity than other materials. For example, Ge et al. (2015) found
a higher adsorption capacity of slag (3.15 g/kg) than gravel (0.81 g/
kg) in batch tests, and the removal of total phosphorus by slag was
about 20% higher than that of gravel in horizontal subsurface flow
(HSSF). However, Chen et al. (2013) observed that pot gravel had a
high total P removal efficiency for 65% in vertical flow stormwater
wetland. The feasibility of P adsorption by gravel was also demonstrated in a large-scale CWs system with the removal efficiency
ranging from 40% to 40% (Mann and Bavor, 1993). The adsorption isotherm of P onto gravel fitted well with Freundlich model
(Tang et al., 2010), indicating a heterogeneous surface of gravel
with nonuniform distribution of the adsorption sites. Several laboratory researches have been conducted to determine the N adsorption capacity of gravel, and researchers have concluded that the

effect of gravel on N adsorption is not very prominent. For example, Zhu et al. (2011) estimated the maximum N adsorption capacities of gravel to be 769.23 mg/kg using the Langmuir isotherm.
However, the field tests have achieved more positive results. During the 2-year monitoring, Ge et al. (2015) observed comparable N
removal rates in large-scale horizontal subsurface flow CWs with
either gravel or slag as substrate, providing a possible solution
for polluted urban river remediation in northern China.
There are numerous examples that gravel as CWs substrate has
excellent heavy metals removal capacity. Buddhawong et al.
(2010) found that in the CWs with gravel as the substrate could
completely remove As and Zn. The Cr and Ni removal abilities of
gravel-bed CWs were studied by Yadav et al. (2010), and results
showed that the maximum removal of Cr and Ni reached 98.3%
and 96.2%, respectively. Some studies indicated gravel had the
potential for water decolorization. Bulc and Ojstršek (2008) tried
to use CWs to treat dye-rich textile wastewater, and results
showed that CWs packed with gravel, sand, and zeolitic could
reduce colour by up to 70%. Manios et al. (2002) found CWs with
gravel reed beds achieved a high reduction of E. coli, and could
remove above 3.3 log for E. coli.
2.1.2. Sand
Sand is a kind of granular material with a grain size <2 mm,
which is rolled by rain or rolled by rock after weathering. It is usually divided into coarse sand (permeability coefficient: 9  10 7 6  10 3 m/s), medium sand (permeability coefficient:
9  10 7 5  10 4 m/s) and fine sand (permeability coefficient:
2  10 7 2  10 4 m/s). The main component of sand is SiO2
with a density of 2.65 g/cm3 (Zuhailawati et al., 2007).
The P removal by sand-filled CWs have been widely studied.
Greenway (2016) compared the P removal efficiency of various
CW substrate materials, and found sand was the best (94–99%), followed by brickies loam (92%), and then red mud modified sand
(86–89%). A long-term full-scale study indicated the subsurface
flow CWs with sand substrate could remove 99% of dissolved P
within three years (Shannon et al., 2001). Based on the budget
analysis on sand-bed CWs (Mander et al., 2003), 88.1% of P was
removed by sand adsorption, which far outweighed the contributions of plant accumulation and microbial immobilization. However, some type of sand is unsuitable for long-term P retention in
CWs. For example, a pilot study reported masonry sand substrate
retained insignificant quantity of P (11.9 ± 21.8 mg/kg) after one
year of CWs operation (Forbes et al., 2005). In recent years, several
studies about N removal by sand-filled CWs was carried out. A fullscale study on the sand-bed CWs showed that total N removal
increased from 60.1% to 93.4% in the first three years of operation
(Shannon et al., 2001). Eturki et al. (2012) studied the wastewater
purification capacity of sand-clays fortified by pebbles, and this
reconstituted sand filter gave a N reduction of 65%.

Scholz (2003) indicated sand substrate could effectively remove
the heavy metals and play the dominant role for the removal of
heavy metals in CWs. Wu et al. (2014) studied the potential of
manganese sand as CW substrate for removal of As(V), and the
results showed manganese sand had an As(V) adsorption capacity
of 42.37 lg/g. Quiñónez-Díaz et al. (2001) investigated the removal
of FIB by a sand-filled CW, and found that >90% of FIB were
removed.
2.1.3. Shale
Shale is a rock formed by dehydration and cementation of clay.
According to different composition, shale is divided into carbonaceous shale, calcareous shale, sandy shale and siliceous shale. The
compressive strength of rock mass is 19.61–68.65 MPa or lower,
and the permeability coefficient is 1  10 13 2  10 9 m/s.
Many studies have shown that shale has very excellent P
adsorption effect. Drizo et al. (1999) compared the P adsorption
effects of seven substrates, and results showed that the fly ash
and shale had the best P adsorption capacity, followed by bauxite,
limestone and light expanded clay aggregates. Long term experiments showed that shale and bauxite gave the maximum P adsorption capacity of 730 and 355 mg/kg. A one-year pilot study
indicated expanded shale can greatly improve the retention of P
in CWs, and for a substrate depth of 0.9 m, aerial P retention by
shale was 201 ± 98.6 g/m2 y (Forbes et al., 2005). Daothaisong
and Yimrattanabovorn (2009) indicated that shale was a potential
substrate in CWs for N removal. The adsorption efficiencies of shale
for NH4-N and NO3-N were 52.9–69.0% and 57.0–72.0%,
respectively.
2.1.4. Soil/sediment
Soil is a major component of the Earth’s ecosystem, and forms
pedosphere. Soil particles comprise of minerals (clay, silt and sand)
with a density of 2.6–2.7 g/cm3. The permeability coefficient of
soil/sediment is 6.0  10 7–6.0  10 6 m/s. When the soil is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, the soil particles
will be washed away by the water, flow into the river, lake and
ocean, and form the sediments by sedimentation (Fernandez
et al., 2003).
Numerous researches have been conducted in recent years, and
demonstrated that soil/sediment in CWs exhibited excellent P
sorption capacity. Farahbakhshazad et al. (2000) found that vertical upflow wetland system in Piracicaba, Brazil could removal
93% P and the effective P removal was observed in the top soil layer
which had a high surface adsorption area. The ability of peat soil to
retain PO4-P was determined by adsorption isotherms in both laboratory and field tests (Heikkinen et al., 1995; Walbridge and
Struthers, 1993), and the contents of oxalate-extractable Fe and
Al in peat soil could positively influence the ability of peat to retain
P. Litaor et al. (2003) found that a relatively low degree of P saturation (DPS < 15%) was observed in histosols, while a high DPS
(>30%) was observed in many of the hydromorphic organomineral soils. D’Angelo (2005) observed that late successional
(LS) soils had three times greater capacity to remove and retain
soluble inorganic P than early successional (ES) soils, which was
mostly due to higher amounts of amorphous Al oxides (oxalateextractable) in LS soils. Reddy et al. (1998) indicated the P retention by stream sediments and Wetland soils was strongly correlated with contents of amorphous and poorly crystalline forms of
Fe and Al, which explained 87% of the variability in P retention.
Besides of the mineral compositions, the organic matter in soil/
sediment also play an important role for the P removal (Gilbin
et al., 2000).
Different results were achieved by researchers about N removal
capacities of soil/sediment. Zhu et al. (2011) reported the maximum NH4-N adsorption capacities of paddy soil and red soil were

5

588.2 and 555.6 mg/kg, respectively. Zhang et al. (2017) indicated
that 98.8% of NH4-N and 88.3% of total N (248.6 mg/L) were
removed from low-strength swine wastewater by a pilot-scale SF
CW using sediment as the substrate, and vegetation of the macrophytes (e.g., Myriophyllum aquaticum) would increase the N
removal of CWs by enhancing the sediment microorganisms
responsible for N cyclings. Llorens et al. (2015) reported a mean
removal efficiency of 52% for total N could be achieved using a
hybrid constructed soil filter. For the N removal mechanism in
soil-filled CWs, studies indicated microbial nitrification/denitrification played the dominant role, and adsorption onto soil and plant
uptake played the secondary role (Abe et al., 2014). Therefore, promoting the microbial activity in soils is an effective way to enhance
the N removal in CWs, such as modulating the favorable pH for
microbial growth (Yin et al., 2016).
Many studies indicated soil substrate in CWs can effectively
adsorb heavy metals, which played the most important role for
the removal of heavy metals. For example, Mohammed and
Babatunde (2017) indicated that up to 91%, 91% and 89% of Cr,
Cd and Pd respectively could be removed by soil adsorption process in VF CWs. Palmer et al. (2015) measured the retention efficiencies based on monitoring of peatland inflow and outflow
waters and the results indicated that retention of As, Sb and Ni
was generally good (up to 95%) but temporarily variable. Adsorption experiments indicated the high potential of peat soils to
adsorb As, Ni and especially Sb. Ncibi et al. (2017) indicated that
soil-filled CWs were suitable for removal of surfactants, and the
removal efficiency of nonionic surfactants was higher than that
of anionic surfactants.
Nowadays, removal of pesticides/herbicides from water by soil/
sediment based CWs has become a hot topic, and many studies on
this have been carried out. Passeport et al. (2011) indicated wetland sediment and forest soil had the most important potential
for pesticides adsorption. Vallée et al. (2014) found that the presence of plants in CWs could increase soil/sediment sorption capacity for pesticides, which probably because the presence of plants
increases water retention time and pesticide residues, then prolongs the contact time between soil/sediment and pesticides.
Besides of the soil sorption and plant accumulation, microbial
degradation was demonstrated to play an important role for the
removal of herbicides in SF CWs with soil (Chen et al., 2017). For
the removal process of pesticides across soil/sediment-filled CWs,
retention time is a critical factor influencing the final removal efficiency (Gregoire et al., 2009).
Studies demonstrated CWs with soil/sediment substrate could
effectively remove pharmaceuticals (Hussain et al., 2012), dyes
(Davies et al., 2006), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) (Chow
et al., 2017), and many other organic contaminants. Hussain
et al. (2012) studied the removal efficiency of three antibiotics of
ionophore group in two SF CWs with different substrates: one with
a sandy clay loam soil and another with a sandy soil. Sandy soil
condition showed higher removal efficiency in comparison to
sandy clay loam soil. More water could immerse in sandy soil than
in clay soil, which provides more interaction between pharmaceuticals and substrate, resulting in greater pharmaceuticals sorption
onto sandy soil than clay soils.
Numerous studies have shown that CWs can effectively remove
FIB from wastewater (Dorsey et al., 2010; Morató et al., 2014), and
SSF CWs have a better removal capacity than SF CWs (Wu et al.,
2016b). Hydrology and wetland studies generally assume the
removal mechanism of FIB in CWs is binding to soil particles in
the water and immobilizing as soil particles sedimentation
(Waller and Bruland, 2016). Predation by copepods (Song et al.,
2008) and zooplankton (Chudoba et al., 2013) is an another important mechanism for the removal of bacteria in CWs. In addition,
root exudates/rhizosphere microbes may also adversely impact



6

Y. Wang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 701 (2020) 134736

the survival of fecal microorganisms (Chandrasena et al., 2017). A
lot of studies have been conducted and recommended soil or sediment as a good substrate for FIB removal in CWs. For example,
Thurston et al. (2001) reported that in the CWs with soil substrate
receiving secondary sewage effluent, total coliforms were reduced
by an average of 98.8%, FIB by 98.2%, and coliphage by 95.2%.
2.1.5. Zeolite
Zeolite is formed from the reactions between volcanic rocks and
ash layers with alkaline groundwater, and it is also crystallized in
post-depositional environments in shallow marine basins. The
skeleton structure of the zeolite is relatively porous with a specific
gravity of 2.0–2.2, and the dehydrated cavity can be as large as 47–
50%. Rich micropore and macropore of zeolite determines its high
sorption capacity (sum of absorption and adsorption) for contaminants. Besides, it has good characteristics of ion exchange, catalysis, stability, chemical reactivity, reversible dehydration, and
conductivity. Zeolite has been widely used in the treatment of
wastewater and landfill leachate because of its low price, easy to
obtain, large specific surface area, well-developed pore channel,
good ion exchange capacity, and good removal capacity on heavy
metals, ammonia and other contaminants (Wen et al., 2018).
Zeolite is well-known as a substrate used in CWs, while various
studies have proved that its P adsorption capacity is low. For example, Zhang et al. (2006) demonstrated that the removal efficiency of
phosphate and hydrogen ions of shale was better than that of zeolite, which was due to the main component of shale was CaCO3. Dai
and Hu (2017) studied the P adsorption capacities of four substrate
materials and revealed zeolite had a moderate adsorption capacity.
Stefanakis et al. (2009) used fine- and coarse-grained clinoptilolite
in CWs. The average removal rate of total P by the two kinds of zeolites was 56.8% and 40.5%, respectively. The mechanistic study carried out by Cheng et al. (2013) indicated the adsorption of P onto
zeolite was more apt to electrostatic attraction or ion-exchange,
while other active adsorption materials (e.g., sponge iron) was
more apt to chemical combination. The ability to adsorb P could
be improved by modifying zeolite or combining with other substrates (Zhang et al., 2014).
Zeolite is rich in micropores and mesopores and therefore has
strong N adsorption capacity especially ammonia. In recent years,
many researches investigated the N adsorption onto zeolite and
recommended zeolite as an ideal CWs substrate to enhance the N
removal in CWs (Cyrus and Reddy, 2011; Zou et al., 2012).
Pucher et al. (2017) investigated the effect of zeolite layer with different depths on removal of NH4-N. Results indicated that the
increase of zeolite layer in CWs could significantly reduce the
amount of NH4-N in wastewater. Laboratory-scale experiment carried out by Liu et al. (2014) showed that the N removal efficiency of
zeolite-based CWs was better than that of other substrates filled
CWs, which was because of the competitive properties of zeolite
(micropore volume: 61.2 mm3/g, specific surface area: 16.6 m2/g,
and cation exchange capacity: 4.3 cmol/kg). Peng et al. (2012) indicated zeolite substrate adsorption played a dominant role for the
removal of NH4-N in CWs in low temperature (3–7.5 °C), while
both nitrification and zeolite adsorption made contribution in high
temperature (20–25 °C). A lot of mixed substrates of zeolite and
other materials showed high N sorption capacities (Fang et al.,
2016; Mojiri et al., 2016). For example, Singh et al. (2014) found
the mixture of natural zeolite and gravel as the CWs substrate
showed a high removal efficiency of NH4-N (78%). Pálfy et al.
(2017) reported a sand-zeolite mixture filter could removal 52%
of N. Research conducted by Shi et al. (2017) showed that the combination of steel slag and zeolite was better than two separate substrates for N removal.
Zeolite has shown a high potential for removal of heavy metals
as CWs substrate. A laboratory-scale study investigated by Allende

et al. (2011) indicated that zeolite could significantly remove As,
Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn.
2.1.6. Limestone
Limestone is a sedimentary rock which is often composed of the
skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, foraminifera
and molluscs. The main component of limestone is calcium carbonate, and its density is about 2.65–2.80 g/cm3. The permeability
coefficient of limestone is 1  10 9–6  10 6 m/s. Limestone are
widely used as raw materials for building, as white pigment in
paints, as a chemical feedstock for the production of lime, and as
a soil conditioner (Flores et al., 2018).
Li et al. (2012) investigated the influencing factors of limestone
adsorption with a series of batch experiments including temperature, pH, limestone size, background electrolyte and organic acids.
Based on the results, they concluded that limestone was suitable
for P removal as CWs substrate in wastewater advanced treatment.
However, Drizo et al. (1999) showed that the P adsorption capacity
of limestone was moderate, and suggested mixing limestone with
other materials (e.g., zeolite) to improve the P removal efficiency.
There are relatively limited studies for the application of limestone
substrate in CWs for N removal. Srinivasan et al. (2008) used a
combined adsorbent of limestone and zeolite and achieved a
removal rate of 70% for NH4-N. The heavy metal removal capacities
of gravel, cocopeat, zeolite and limestone were investigated by
Allende et al. (2012), and limestone showed the best removal
capacity.
2.1.7. Volcanics
Volcanics belongs to magmatic rock (igneous rock). It is a extrusive rock formed from magma condensed from the crater to the
Earth’s surface. Volcanics is among the most common rock types
on Earth’s surface, and it has been estimated that volcanics covers
about 8% of the land surface. Volcanics is porous and has a good
hydraulic conductivity (Liu et al., 2013a). The permeability coefficient of limestone is 8  10 9–3  10 4 m/s. It is composed mainly
of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, and CaO (Ramos et al.,
2015).
The P adsorption capacity of volcanics was very poor, and sometimes, volcanics could be used as an ingredient of substrate mixture to enhance treatment performance of CWs (Zhao et al.,
2016). Liu et al. (2014) demonstrated that the N adsorption capacity of volcanics was low. However, as mentioned above, the mixture of zeolite, expanded vermiculite, and volcanics showed good
N adsorption efficiencies (Zhao et al., 2016).
2.1.8. Minerals
Minerals are the elements and their chemical compounds that
are produced and developed in a variety of geological processes,
and are relatively stable under certain geological and physicochemical conditions. A mineral has a relatively fixed chemical composition and a definite internal structure, which is the basic unit for
the composition of rocks and ores. The widely used minerals in
CWs include calcite (CaCO3), dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), hornblende
((Ca,Na)2-3(Mg,Fe,Al)5(Al,Si)8O22(OH,F)2), hematite (Fe2O3), apatite
(Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl)2), wollastonite (CaSiO3), vermiculite (Mg0.7(Mg,Fe,Al)6(Si,Al)8O20(OH)48H2O) and pyrite (FeS2).
Calcite was demonstrated by Dong et al. (2008) to be the best
adsorption substrate for P at various temperatures and pH. They
reported the removal of total P in the effluent was 94.3% in hybrid
CWs with calcite substrate. Phosphorus uptake by calcite was also
studied in both batch and continuous systems by Molle et al.
(2003). In batch tests, calcite showed attractive sorption capacity,
however, some limitation in retention capacity and effluent quality
were pointed out in open reactor experiments. CWs with river sand
and dolomite (10:1, w/w) as substrate were studied on phosphate



Y. Wang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 701 (2020) 134736

removal by Prochaska and Zouboulis (2006), and results indicated
that CWs could remove more than 45% of initially applied phosphate. Tang et al. (2010) indicated the maximum P adsorption
capacity of hornblende was 153.1 mg/kg with the particle size in
the range of 0.5–1.0 mm, and the adsorption data could be well
explained by Langmuir isotherm model. Grüneberg and Kern
(2001) reported the P adsorption capacity of hematite was
140 lg/g, and the adsorption of P was mainly dependent on the
formation of amorphous ferrous hydroxides under anaerobic condition. Apatite is an effective and sustainable substrate for P
removal from wastewater. Dong et al. (2008) indicated calcite
was the best adsorption substrate for N compared with other substrate materials, and the removal efficiency reached to 68.4% in the
CWs using calcite as the substrate. However, the other minerals
including dolomite showed modest N removal capacity.
Some researches were conducted to determine if minerals could
be used in heavy metal removal. Chowdhury (2017) found that
pyrite was the main adsorbent for As in microbe-mediated adsorption process in CWs. Kaplan and Knox (2004) found that apatite
addition to sediment resulted in the significant reduction of Cd,
Co, Hg, Pb, and U concentrations in porewater.
2.2. Agricultural/industrial wastes
2.2.1. Alum sludge
Alum sludge is a waste product from the drinking water treatment plant when aluminium salts are employed as the coagulants.
The content of aluminium in alum sludge is 30% based on dry
weight (Babatunde and Zhao, 2007). Although the most prevalent
final disposal of the dewatered alum sludge is landfill, the reuse
of the alum sludge is attracting more and more attention (Zhao
et al., 2009a). The idea of reuse alum sludge as CWs substrate lies
in its characteristics of abundant Al content and easy, local and
huge availability. Aluminium sludge itself can form a precipitation
of aluminium hydroxide, which was used to adsorb and precipitate
phosphorus and nitrogen. At the same time, colloidal precipitation
of aluminium hydroxide also increases the porosity of alum sludge,
and provides sufficient and persistent permeability.
In recent years, several researches have been carried out and
demonstrated the high nutrients adsorption capacity of alum
sludge as CWs substrate. For example, Zhao et al. (2009b) conducted a batch test of P adsorption onto alum sludge. Result
showed that alum sludge (dry solid) had excellent P adsorption
capacity of 14.3 mg/g at pH 7.0, and lower pH was more conducive
to adsorption. The column test with alum sludge media achieved P
removal efficiency of 91.9% under the hydraulic loading of 0.36 m3/
m2d. Zhao et al. (2011) also conducted a pilot test on CW system
with alum sludge as the main substrate, and results showed that
the average removal rates of total P and inorganic P per month
were 75–94% and 73–97%, respectively. In a column test with alum
sludge media, Zhao et al. reported a high removal efficiency of
76.5% for total N (Zhao et al., 2009b). In another pilot test on
CWs with alum sludge as substrate, Zhao et al. (2011) found the
average removal rates of total N and NH4-N per month were 11–
78% and 49–93%, respectively, indicating that NH4-N could be
effectively reduced by alum sludge.
2.2.2. Oyster shell
Oysters are salt-water bivalve molluscs that live in marine or
brackish habitats. Oysters have many uses: some kinds of oyesters
can be consumed by humans, some oysters produce pearls within
the mantle, and translucent shells of some windowpane oysters
can be for decorative objects. Oyster shell contains high concentration of CaCO3 (>95% by weight) (Cheng et al., 2018).
Many studies have shown that oyster shell has excellent effect
on P adsorption. During the adsorption test carried out by Wang

7

et al. (2013a), oyster shell showed the best phosphate removal efficiency. The authors furtherly carried out a pilot test to treat the
wastewater by a VF CW using oyster shell as the substrate and
achieved a very significant removal of P. For the P removal mechanism, adsorption and precipitation played the greatest role, and
speciation analysis indicated adsorption of P onto oyster shell
was dominated by active Ca (Liu et al., 2013a). Yam et al. (2013)
indicated that oyster shell was an effective N adsorbent in CWs.
In Park and Polprasert’ work (2008), the integrated CW system
packed with oyster shells as filtration media showed a high efficiency in removing N.
2.2.3. Woodchip
Woodchip is sawdust and shavings powder left in wood processing. It is mainly used to make paper, fuel, lightweight filling
material, or wood based panel. As reported, wood chips would
leach out organic compounds and provide increased organic concentration in the wastewater. Besides, wood chips would have
short system life, rapidly losing their permeability. Recently, some
researchers indicated applying woodchip to CWs as substrate
could enhance operation performance (Robertson, 2010).
Chen et al. (2013) constructed woodchip-based VF CWs and
achieved a high total N removal efficiency (40%). Fatehi-Pouladi
and co-workers designed woodchip bioreactors based on the
CWs principle and conducted a long term study to treat greenhouse effluent (Fatehi-Pouladi et al., 2019). The bioreactors exhibited excellent N removal capacity, and planting with Typha
angustifolia could increase the denitrification rate. Gottschall
et al. (2016) applied woodchip bioreactors to treat drainage from
agricultural production systems, and evaluated the removal efficiencies for a suite of veterinary antibiotics. Results showed woodchip bioreactors had a very high removal efficiency for all the
antibiotics.
2.2.4. Plant waste
Plant waste refers to the by-product generated during the plant
processing, such as coconut dust, coconut shell, cocopeat, cattails
leaves, oil palm shell, reed leaves, sedge shoots, bark mulch, rice
husk, and straw. Due to rich organic carbon, porous structure
and light weight, many plant wastes can be applied to CWs as
the substrate to enhance the treatment performance.
Karunarathna et al. (2007) indicated that the P removal rate of
CWs with coconut dust as the substrate was 98%. Chen et al. (2010)
investigated the P removal efficiency by the dried straw of water
hyacinth. The straw showed a rapid reduction of total P, and the
adsorption efficiency at saturation was about 36%. Karunarathna
et al. (2007) demonstrated that the removal efficiency of total N
and NO3-N by CWs with coconut powder as substrate was significantly higher than that of sand-based CWs.
Allende et al. (2011) conducted a lab-scale study and indicated
that cocopeat could significantly remove As, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn.
Sharainliew et al. (2011) found cattails (Typha angustifolia) leaves
was a feasible, cheap and environmentally friendly substrate for
Pb(II) adsorption. Batch adsorption test showed that cattails leaves
with the optimized dosage of 0.6 g could effectively remove 86.04%
of Pb(II) at equilibrium from a 100 mL Pb(II) solution of 25 mg/L.
Chong et al. (2013) found that oil palm shell had the adsorption
capacity of 1.756 and 3.390 mg/g for Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively.
Parallel batch experiments conducted by Camilo et al. (2013) indicated bark mulch bioreactors were capable of retaining the herbicides atrazine or bentazone, and the removal of herbicides were
based on adsorption to bark mulch and degradation processes.
Saba et al. (2015) studied the decolorization in CWs, and adsorption process could remove 50% dye with rice husk as substrate.
Weragoda et al. (2010) indicated applying coconut shell as substrate in CW system could increase E. coli removal.

2.2.5. Fly ash
Fly ash is a fine ash captured from the flue gas after coal combustion, and is the main solid waste discharged from coal-fired
power plants. Its main oxide compositions include SiO2, Al2O3,
FeO, Fe2O3, CaO, and TiO2. Fly ash particles are porous and honeycomb, with large specific surface area and high adsorption capacity. The particle size ranges from 0.5 to 300 lm.
Guo et al. (2014) used the mixture of fly ash and soil in CWs as
substrate to remove P from wastewater. The results showed that
when the mass ratio of fly ash and soil was 3:7, the treatment
effect was the best, and the removal rate of total P was 97.58%.
Removal of different forms of P was investigated by Liu et al.
(2013b) using fly ash brickbat in CWs. Results revealed that the
removal of soluble active P was accomplished by adsorption onto
the substrate with a removal rate of over 97%. Wendling et al.
(2013) demonstrated that fly ash could effectively remove organic
and inorganic N. The potential neoformation of Al, Fe and Mn
oxide/hydroxide minerals, such as Fe(OH)3, a-FeOOH, a-Fe2O3, Fe8O8(OH)6(SO4)nH2O, in fly ash promotes the sorption of nutrients
and DOC. Guo et al. (2014) found the removal rate of total N and
NH4-N were 57.52% and 93.78%, respectively across the CWs using
the mixture of fly ash and soil as the substrate.
2.2.6. Slag
Slag includes blast furnace (BF) slag and steel slag. BF slag is a
by-product of blast furnace ironmaking process, which contains
Si (30–40%), CaO (30–40%), Al2O3 (5–15%), and Fe2O3 (0.02–
0.45%) (Haynes et al., 2011). BF slag is a hard crystalline material
and its mineralogy is dominated by calcium aluminosilicate mellilite group including akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and gehlenite (Ca2Al
(AlSiO7)). Steel slag the by-product of steel-making process, which
contains Fe2O3 (42–84%), CaO (25–55%), SiO2 (9–18%), Al2O3 (0–
3%), and MnO (1–6%) (Geiseler, 1996). Steel slag has a crystalline
structure with the main mineral phase being wustite (FeO), and
the other phases include dicalcium silicate, tricalcium silicate,
and dicalcium ferrite.
BF slag and steel slag have been demonstrated to be an excellent adsorbent for P by numerous researches. Mann (1997)
observed that steelworks by-products (i.e., BF slag, steel slag and
fly ash) exhibited high P adsorption capacities (>380 mg/kg), and
the P adsorption capacities of slags were closely related to the
active Ca and Mg. In batch experiments conducted by Korkusuz
et al. (2007), BF granulated slag showed the highest P adsorption
capacity than other filter materials due to its higher content of
Ca and porous structure. Paul and Anderson (2011) evaluated the
P removal efficiencies of BF slag and cement clinker in long-term
flow cell experiments, with gravel as a control medium. As a result,
BF slag and cement clinker showed nearly 100% P removal efficiency, while the control substrate gravel only achieved 50%
removal efficiency. Blanco et al. (2016) studied the P removal by
basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel slag. In column experiments,
BOF steel slag achieved the P removal efficiency of higher than
99%, and P removal capacity of 3.1 mg/g. The P removal mechanism
was mainly calcium phosphate precipitation, which depended on
the release of Ca2+ and OH from the BOF steel slag. Zhu et al.
(2011) compared several substrates for N adsorption capacity,
and
BF
slag
exhibited
medium adsorption
capacity.
Andreomartínez et al. (2017) found applying BF slag to CWs as
adsorption substrate would be beneficial for total N removal.
Andreomartínez et al. (2017) found that HF CWs filled with BF
slag could effectively remove E. coli with a removal of 96.9 ± 1.7%.
2.2.7. Construction waste
Construction waste refers to the dregs, residual materials, abandoned bricks, silt, and other wastes produced in the process of construction, laying, demolition and repair of various buildings,

structures and pipelines. Utilization of construction waste is a
promising way to reduce its disposal cost.
Wang et al. (2013a) screened P-removing substrates for use in
CWs treating swine wastewater, and indicated broken bricks were
suitable substrates for P removal. Zhou et al. (2010) studied the
nutrients removal from secondary effluent across the CWs with
foamed insulation bricks as the substrate. Results showed that
the removal rate of total P reached 75%, while the removal rate
of total N was only 30%.
2.3. Artificial materials
2.3.1. Ceramsite
Ceramsite is a round, oval or irregular ceramic particle, with the
bulk density of 300–900 kg/m3, and particle size of 5–25 mm. Ceramsite is produced by ceramic production of raw materials by high
temperature calcination. Ceramsite can be used in wastewater
treatment and CWs due to its high adsorption capacity, stability
and affinity to microbial biofilm biomass (Wu et al., 2016a).
He et al. (2010) compared several substrates for nutrients
adsorption in CWs, and fly ash ceramsite showed the largest
adsorption amount of P, but a medium capacity for N. The P
adsorption onto ceramic sands were studied by Wang et al.
(2013b), and the Langmuir equation could well describe the experimental data of adsorption isotherm. Cheng and co-workers prepared a sustainable and efficient ceramsite substrate for P
immobilization in CWs by adopting coal fly ash and waterworks
sludge as the main materials, and oyster shell as the additive
(Cheng et al., 2018). Static adsorption experiments indicated the
theoretical maximum P adsorption capacity of as prepared ceramsite reached up to 4.51 mg/g, and the dynamic column experiments
filled with ceramsite medium achieved as much as 90% of the P
removal with an HRT of 12 h. Yuan et al. (2015) used bentonite,
metallic iron, and activated carbon to prepare ceramisite, and the
as-prepared ceramisite achieved a high Pb removal efficiency
(>99%).
2.3.2. Activated carbon
Activated carbon is an amorphous carbon obtained by processing. It has a large specific surface area, and has a good adsorption
capacity for gas, inorganic or organic matter and colloid particles
in the solution. The properties of activated carbon are stable, high
mechanical strength, acid resistance, alkali resistance, heat resistance, insoluble in water and organic solvents, and reusable. It
has been widely used in various fields, such as chemical industry,
environmental protection, food processing, metallurgy, pharmaceutical refining and so on (Dias et al., 2007). At present, modified
activated carbon materials have been widely used in the fields of
sewage treatment and air pollution prevention and control, and
become more and more attractive in the field of environmental
pollution control (Kyzas et al., 2015).
Dai and Hu (2017) evaluated the P adsorption of several CWs
substrates, and indicated the P adsorption efficiency of activated
carbon was not very good. A pilot investigation indicated the
biologically-active granular activated carbon was an effective
method to remove NH4-N with an average removal of
60.87 ± 29.69% (Fu et al., 2017).
2.3.3. Synthetic fiber
Synthetic fiber is made by chemical processes, as opposed to
natural fiber. Synthetic fiber is made from synthesized polymers
of small molecules. Synthetic fiber has advantages of high strength,
light quality, good elasticity, water resistant and stain resistant.
Chen et al. (2013) found synthetic fiber had a relatively good P
removal rate of 75%. However, synthetic fiber was poor in ammonia removal (Chen et al., 2012).

2.3.4. Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a semi-finished product obtained by using
limestone and clays as main raw materials in an appropriate ratio,
buring to partial or full melting, and then cooling. Cement clinker is
usually of diameter 3–25 mm and dark grey in color. The main
components of cement clinker are alite, belite, aluminate, and ferrite. Cement clinker is primarily used to produce cement.
Cement clinker has been studied and showed excellent P
removal capacity. For example, Calder et al. (2006) investigated
capacity of cement clinker to remove P in a SF CWs posttreatment filter, and cement clinker showed a good P removal
capacity, keeping an outflow dissolved P concentration of
0.72 ± 0.20 mg/L. Paul and Anderson (2011) found the P removal
efficiency of BF slag and cement clinker in long-term flow cell
experiments could reach up to nearly 100%.

2.3.5. Recycled concrete
Recycled concrete refers to the new concrete which is made up of
waste concrete blocks, mixing with cement and water. Recycled
concrete can partially or totally replace natural aggregates such as
sand and stone. Recycled aggregate are already used in all
countries in various applications of civil engineering works, as
road pavement materials, subbasements, soil stabilization,
improvement of subground, production of concrete of many
categories.
Molle et al. (2003) investigated the P uptake of recycled
concrete in both batch and continuous systems. Recycled concrete showed excellent P sorption capacity. However, recycled concrete was sensitive to strong dissolution, leading to rapid
precipitation of P, but led to high conductivity and pH values in
treated water.

2.3.6. Modified clays
Various modified clay products develop including expanded
clay, calcined clay, Filtralite PÒ and so on. Filtralite PÒ is high
quality filter media, manufactured from expanded clay material,
and used for filtration and purification of waste and effluent
water for dispersed settlements. The material is a commercially
available product with a high pH (>10) and a high Ca and Mg content. It has a grain size in the range 0.5–4 mm, effective porosity of
40%, particle porosity of 68%, and bulk density of 0.55 g/cm3 (Ádám
et al., 2007).
Drizo et al. (1999) determined the P adsorption capacity of
seven substrates, and concluded that the adsorption effect of light
expanded clay on P was not very good. However, other studies
demonstrated the good performance of expanded clay and calcined
clay on P adsorption. White et al. (2011) observed that the average
P adsorption capacity of crude calcined clay reached up to 497 mg/
kg. Jesus et al. (2014) found that expanded clay showed excellent N
adsorption capacity, and could adsorbed 0.31 mg/kg of NH4-N after
7 days of contact. The P adsorption capacity of Filtralite PÒ was
evaluated by Ádám et al. (2007) in both batch and column experiments. In column tests, the removal rate of P in primary wastewater was 91%, and in secondary wastewater was 54%. Jenssen et al.
(2010) investigated the removal of FIB by saturated filters containing Filtralite PÒ, and found FIB in effluent met the European bathing water quality criteria.
Ferreira et al. (2017) evaluated the capacity of CWs to remove
three emerging organic contaminants. The presence of light
expanded clay aggregates showed higher removal (around 61–
97%) of lipophilic compounds (oxybenzone and triclosan) than
the hydrophilic compound (caffeine; around 19–85%).

2.4. Interaction with plant/microorganism
Many studies showed that the presence of plant could effectively improve adsorption of contaminants onto substrate materials in CWs, especially for nutrients and pesticides/herbicides. This
probably because the presence of plants increases water retention
time, which prolongs the contact time between substrate materials
and contaminants, then the adsorption of contaminants onto substrate materials in CWs are improved. In addition, the presence of
plants changes the pH of the system, which is possibly more conducive to adsorption of contaminants onto substrates. For example,
Wu et al. (2014) conducted batch tests, and demonstrated the
planted units exhibited better performance in P-sorption capacity
compared to the unplanted ones. Mbuligwe (2005) found that
the overall treatment efficiency of the vegetated CW units was
more than twice as high as that of the unplanted bed. On average,
the bed vegetated with coco yam plants performed better (7.6%)
than the one planted with cattail plants. Drizo et al. (2000) found
that the presence of plants can increase the adsorption capacity
of shale for P and N. Martín et al. (2013) noted that a VF CW could
remove more P and N when planted with reeds. Yang et al. (2002)
noted that the effect of plant litter was also a significant mechanism affecting nutrient removal in the SF pattern soil-bed wetland
systems without harvest. Abe et al. (2014) indicated that N was
removed mainly by denitrification and secondarily by adsorption
to soil and by plant uptake. Shannon et al. (2001) also found that
N removal in the wetland treatment cells might continue to
improve as the density of wetland vegetation increased.
Papaevangelou et al. (2016) noted that planted CW units showed
better performance for Cr removal than the unplanted ones. D
et al. (2017) indicated that the emergent plants would be helpful
for decreasing the dredging soil depth for the final removal of
heavy metals. Vallée et al. (2014) demonstrated that the presence
of plants could increase sorption capacity of soil-sediment substrate for pesticides. Chen et al. (2017) reported that plants could
enhance the removal of chloroacetanilide herbicides in CWs, especially the floating hydroponic root mat. Rogers and Stringfellow
(2009) found that sorption for pesticides to whole plant stems
(Kd = 570–1300 L/kg) was more than 10 times higher than to soil
(Kd = 40–71 L/kg). Chen et al. (2017) demonstrated that all three
planted systems were effective in removing herbicides with
removal efficiency being >92% after operating for 9 days. Tee
et al. (2009) indicated that planted wetland units performed better
than the unplanted ones in the removal and mineralization of phenol. Thomas (2003) noted that in CW system, planted with Phragmites australis in gravel media, greater linear alkylbenzene
sulphonate (LAS) removal was observed in the spring coinciding
with the plant growth season. Studies conducted by Sehar et al.
(2016) highlighted the presence of vegetation/plants in CWs could
achieve better FIB removal.
Microorganisms in substrate have also been found to improve
the contaminants removal in CWs. For example, Chowdhury
(2017) demonstrated that microbes could promote the adsorption
of As by iron sulfide. Saba et al. (2015) noted that augmentation of
microorganisms in CW systems had improved dye removal efficiency to 90%.

3. Evaluation and recommendation

substrates. Then the score is used to evaluate the quality of
substrate, and high score indicates an excellent substrate. In the
model, the score comes from the sum of the scores of each
parameter. The scoring indicators are as follows: Contaminant
removal capacity: low = 0, medium = 1, high = 2; Availability:
low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3; Likely cost: low = 3, medium = 2,
high = 1; Permeability: low = 0, medium = 1, high = 2; Reusability:
difficult = -1, neutral = 0, beneficial = 1. The results are shown in
Table 1. Generally, the natural materials (mean score = 12.25)
and agricultural/industrial wastes (mean score = 12) got higher
scores than artificial materials (mean score = 10). This suggests
natural materials and agricultural/industrial wastes have
advantages in cost and effectiveness compared with artificial
materials. Both soil/sediment and gravel got the highest score of
19. However, the composition of soil/sediment varies greatly due
to the complex sources. In addition, there may be secondary pollution issue to use contaminated soil/sediment. Thus, when they are
used as substrate, multiple factors should also be considered.
Gravel is one of the most used traditional substrates in CWs due
to its abundance, low-cost, and retention for various contaminants
(Yang et al., 2018a). Moreover, gravel has the high potential of
permeability and reusability, which provides it more advantages
over soil/sediment as CWs substrate. The recommended gravel
sizes for CWs is 8–16 mm (IWA, 2001). The other substrate
materials with high scores include plant waste (score = 16),
woodchip (score = 13), sand (score = 12), limestone (score = 12),
oyster shell (score = 12), slag (score = 12) and ceramsite
(score = 12).
Because different substrates have different contaminants
removal capacities, specific substrates should be selected considering the contaminants types. For example, for sewage with high
E. coli and suspended particles, peat soil may be used as the CWs
substrate. For wastewater with high content of heavy metals, limestone and zeolite are preferred as the substrate. For eutrophic
waters with high P content, slag or shale is suitable as the
substrate.
The choice of substrates should follow the principles of easy
access, high efficiency, low cost, safety and innocuity. When designing CWs, designers should first screen local materials with high contaminants removal capacities, which could not only improve the
ability of CWs to purify the sewage and reduce the cost, but also
extend the service life of ecological projects. In addition, because
of the great differences in permeability coefficient of different materials, substrates should be chosen according to the wetland designs.
For example, SF CWs can select soil as the substrate. Sand, slag or
their mixture with soil could be used in SSF CWs, because the wetlands need substrate with high permeability coefficient.
Due to complementary effects between various substrates, the
combination of different materials could greatly improve the treatment performance of CWs. For example, the zeolite-gravel mixture
substrate could simultaneously remove both P and N (Singh et al.,
2014). Moreover, there are also synergistic effects between some
substrates, and combining them together will achieve better
removal effect than a single application. The research on the decontamination effect and influencing factors of the combined substrate
will be an important direction for the future research on CWs.
Furthermore, the research and development of new substrate
materials with good retention capacity, long-lasting performance
and cheap cost will also be the focus of CWs substrate research
in the future.

4. Conclusions
Yang et al. reviewed the research progress of some emerging
substrates in CWs (Yang et al., 2018b). Other two papers reviewed

the phosphorus removal capacity of various substrates (Ballantine
and Tanner, 2010; Vohla et al., 2011). So far, there is no comprehensive review on all kinds of substrate materials and especially
evaluation on the removal capacities for various contaminants.
This review has documented various properties, e.g., cost, availability, permeability, reuse, safety and removal capacity for contaminants, of 22 substrate materials in CWs. Their removal
capacities for main water contaminants including nutrients, heavy
metals, surfactants, pesticides/herbicides, emerging contaminants
and FIB were comprehensively described. This paper summarizes
more literature and content, especially more comprehensive
understanding of various substrates than the previous literature
on a single pollutant removal capacity. In addition, a scoring model
for substrate evaluation based on cost, availability, reuse and contaminant removal capacities was established to provide important
reference for the selection of substrates in CWs under different
conditions, which was not available in previous literature. Further,
this model not only advances the value of previous research, but
also provides an important reference method for such research.
Generally, natural materials and agricultural/industrial wastes
got higher scores than artificial materials, which demonstrated
that natural materials and agricultural/industrial wastes had
advantages in cost and effectiveness compared with artificial
materials. Overall, this review provided important reference and
guidance for the selection of CWs substrates, which could improve
the construction and operation of CWs for wastewater treatment.
Further, to a certain extent, the results are only directions for
future work due to the wide variety of methods applied in CWs
and substrates research.
