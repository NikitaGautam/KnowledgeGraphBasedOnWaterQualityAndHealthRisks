#Leveraging Existing Literature on the Web and Deep Neural Models to Build a Knowledge Graph Focused on Water Quality and Health Risks

The repository contains these scripts:

1. Webcrawler scripts to extract data from Web Of Science and National Library of Medicine. 

2. Contains the crawled data using keywords as well as domain specific corpuses related to water quality and health risks.

3. Scripts to create knowledge graph completion (KGC) tasks based triples data from SemMedDB and SemRep.
 
3.  Modified scripts from [KG-BERT](https://github.com/yao8839836/kg-bert#readme) for fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models on KGC tasks

4. Modified scripts from [OPEN-KE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) to test our dataset on the baseline models.

All codes are tested on Python 3.5+.
