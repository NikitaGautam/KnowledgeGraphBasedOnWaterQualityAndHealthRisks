ABSTRACT

46

Studies evaluating the relationship between microbes and human health at non-point source beaches are

47

necessary for establishing criteria which would protect public health while minimizing economic burdens.

48

The objective of this study was to evaluate water quality and daily cumulative health effects

49

(gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory illnesses) for bathers at a non-point source subtropical marine

50

recreational beach in order to better understand the inter-relationships between these factors and hence

51

improve monitoring and pollution prevention techniques. Daily composite samples were collected,

52

during the BEACHES epidemiology study conducted in Miami (FL) at a non-point source beach, and

53

analyzed for several pathogens, microbial source tracking markers, indicator microbes, and environmental

54

parameters. Analysis demonstrated that rainfall and tide were more influential, when compared to other

55

environmental factors and source tracking markers, in determining the presence of both indicator

56

microbes and pathogens. Antecedent rainfall and F+ coliphage detection in water should be further

57

assessed to confirm their possible association with skin and GI illness outcomes, respectively. The

58

results of this research illustrate the potential complexity of beach systems characterized by non-point

59

sources, and how more novel and comprehensive approaches are needed to assess beach water quality for

60

the purpose of protecting bather health.

INTRODUCTION

68

Illness associated with microbial pathogens in recreational marine beaches can have significant health and

69

economic impacts. Globally, each year, there are in excess of 120 million cases of gastrointestinal

70

disease and in excess of 50 million cases of respiratory diseases caused by swimming and bathing in

71

wastewater-polluted coastal waters (Shuval 2003). A study in Orange County, CA demonstrated an

72

estimated 3.3 million dollars per year in excess illness costs for Newport and Huntington Beaches

73

(Dwight 2005).

74

between bathing in point source impacted beaches and health risk (gastrointestinal disease, respiratory,

75

skin, eye, and ear illnesses); and they concluded that symptoms for all these illnesses were increased in

76

bathers compared to non-bathers (Prüss 1998).

77

Indicator microbes are used routinely to evaluate risk of illness from recreational bathing at beaches.

78

These non-pathogenic microbes serve as surrogates for microbial pollution containing pathogenic

79

microbes and are utilized for several reasons. These reasons include: their high concentrations in raw

80

untreated human sewage, ease of detection, and in some cases, associations with human illness rates.

81

Studies show that the EPA-recommended indicator microbe for marine beaches, enterococci, has

82

demonstrated a significant association with illness in point source impacted marine beaches, at least in

83

temperate climates (Prüss 1998; Wade et al. 2003).

84

As was shown with point source impacted beaches, swimming in non-point source impacted beaches may

85

also be a cause of increased illness when compared to non-bathers (Colford et al. 2007; Bonilla et al.

86

2007; Fleisher et al. 2010; Sinigalliano et al. 2010). However a relationship between enterococci and

87

bather health has not been consistently established at non-point source impacted or subtropical marine

88

beaches (Prüss 1998; Haile et al. 1999; Wade et al. 2003; Colford et al. 2007). Recent studies however

89

have shown preliminary relationships between health outcomes and indicators. A study conducted in

90

Miami, FL demonstrated a relationship between enterococci measured by membrane filtration and skin

Since the 1950s, epidemiologic studies have been performed to evaluate relationships

illness, between 24 hour prior rainfall and skin illness, and between water temperature and acute febrile

92

respiratory illness (Sinigalliano et al. 2010). Another study conducted on the California west coast

93

demonstrated a relationship between male-specific coliphage and several symptoms reported by bathers

94

(Colford et al. 2007).

95

In addition to the lack of a consistent association between enterococci and bather health at non-point

96

source impacted and subtropical marine beaches, there are many limitations to using indicator microbes to

97

monitor for fecal contamination and significant human health risk. Enterococci can originate from

98

sources other than humans, and therefore the ratios of pathogens to enterococci may not be consistent

99

with that of human fecal pollution. Enterococci are also heavily influenced by environmental factors,

100

and they do not necessarily address the risks for non-gastrointestinal illnesses, since their association was

101

originally established specifically with gastrointestinal illness (Boehm et al. 2009). Additionally, research

102

has shown that the presence and levels of indicators are not always associated with pathogens in areas

103

impacted by non-point sources of indicator organisms (e.g. rainfall runoff, animals, human shedding, and

104

sand re-suspension) (Deetz et al. 1984; Fujioka et al. 1981; Gerba & Rose 1990; Jiang et al. 2001; Noble

105

& Fuhrman 2001; Jiang & Chu 2004). Furthermore, at both subtropical and temperate climates, the

106

indicator bacteria can multiply in the environment, giving a false impression of an increase of fecal

107

pollution, which is in turn interpreted through current U.S. federal guidelines as an increase in human

108

health risk (Fujioka et al. 1981; Solo-Gabriele et al. 2000; Desmarais et al. 2002; Whitman et al. 2003;

109

Shibata et al. 2004; Whitman et al. 2004; Alm et al. 2006; Beversdorf et al. 2007).

110

Monitoring directly for the specific disease-causing pathogens themselves would be ideal. Studies have

111

shown the presence of pathogenic viruses (such as enteroviruses, reoviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis A

112

virus, and norovirus) in marine waters in many areas (including Greece, Italy, California, Florida, and

113

Hawaii) (Griffin et al. 2003; Ortega et al. 2009). Pathogenic protozoa and bacteria have also been

114

detected in recreational beaches (Elmir et al. 2007; Sunderland et al. 2007; Abdelzaher et al. 2010;

115

Graczyk et al. 2010). However, in both point and non-point source impacted marine beaches in temperate

and sub/tropical climates, epidemiologic studies have not established associations between health risk and

117

specific pathogens. To the author’s knowledge, Haile et al., 1999 was the only study which measured

118

pathogens (enterovirus), other then S.aureus (Fujioka et al. 1994), in conjunction with human effects.

119

Several epidemiologic studies have been initiated at several California beaches (Avalon, Doheny, and

120

Malibu), which have measured pathogens in conjunction with health effects and publications from these

121

studies are pending. The U.S. EPA has also initiated studies in Mississippi, Rhode Island, Alabama, and

122

Puerto Rico, but these study results are also pending and focus on point source impacted beaches. To date,

123

no published studies have evaluated pathogens and health effects concurrently within a subtropical beach

124

environment.

125

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the water quality (indicator microbes, pathogens, and

126

environmental factors) and daily cumulative health effects (gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory

127

illnesses) for bathers at a non-point source subtropical marine recreational beach. This study evaluated

128

the relationships between microbes and environmental conditions; it also evaluated the inter-relationship

129

between health effects and water quality, and identified possible implications for beach regulation

130

practices. Given cost limitations when screening multiple targets including pathogens and concurrently

131

assessing human health, this study was not intended to establish a conclusive relationship between the

132

various factors and targets, but rather to give further insight on how the non-point source beach system

133

functions. The results of this study should be utilized with results from other epidemiologic and water

134

quality studies to establish conclusive statements about the relationship between water quality and human

135

health at non-point source beaches. This study differs from previously published work as part of the

136

BEACHES study (Fleisher et al. 2010; Sinigalliano et al. 2010; Shibata et al. 2010) by reporting the

137

results from daily composite samples during the BEACHES study therefore allowing many more

138

microbiological measures to be compared to environmental parameters and health outcomes and

139

providing an alternate perspective to beach monitoring through composite as opposed to grab samples.

METHODS

142

Site Description

143

Samples were collected from a study beach within Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA (Figure 1). The

144

climate of Miami is classified as “subtropical” because of its geographic location, and its average ambient

145

temperature of 24.8°C. The study beach is an irregularly narrow beach, with an approximate average

146

distance between the mean water line and the outer edge of the sand of 5 m. The beach is 1.6 km long,

147

relatively shallow, and characterized by weak water circulation (Shibata et al. 2004). This beach is the

148

only beach in Miami-Dade County where visitors can bring their pets, particularly dogs. Beach

149

admission is free, and many bathers frequent the beach, particularly during the summer months (Wang et

150

al. 2010). Extensive prior evaluation of the vicinity of the study beach had not found point sources of

151

pollution to this beach (such as sewage outfalls, failing lift stations) or other direct sewage inputs (such as

152

through septic tanks) (Shibata et al. 2004). However several potential non-point sources of pollution

153

such as sand efflux, trash bins, bather shedding, rainfall runoff, offshore boat dumping, dogs and other

154

animals may impact the study beach (Wright et al. 2009; Wright et al. accepted). Sand efflux is believed

155

to be significant (Zhu et al. in review) due to elevated levels of indicators observed in the sand along with

156

intermittent detection of pathogens including Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., enterovirus, and Vibrio

157

vulnificus (Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shah et al. in review). This beach is usually in compliance

158

withregulatory monitoring criteria, but periodically (i.e. 2.1 times per year averaged from 2002 to 2010

159

has been placed under an advisory due to microbial water quality violations (Florida Department of

160

Health, personal communication).

161

Epidemiologic study

162

Sampling occurred as part of the Oceans and Human Health Beach Exposure Assessment and

163

Characterization Health Epidemiologic Study, “BEACHES” (Fleisher et al. 2010). In brief, this study

164

was the first randomized control exposure epidemiological study to be conducted in the United States.

165

The study design involved randomly assigning adults who report regularly bathing in South Florida to

166

either a “bather” or “non-bather” category. Bathers were asked to spend 15 minutes in the water, while

167

non-bathers spent 15 minutes on the beach. Approval was obtained by the Florida Department of Health

168

Internal Review Board (IRB 1491; DOH IRB Number, H07164) and the University of Miami Internal

169

Review Board (IRB 20070306) to include bathers in this study (Fleisher et al. 2010). As part of the

170

BEACHES study two distinct types of water samples were collected, “individual” samples collected by

171

individual bathers and “daily composite samples” which were combined water samples collected

172

throughout each sampling day. The earlier published work focused on describing the epidemiologic data

173

(Fleisher et al. 2010) and also evaluated, for the “individual” samples, dose-response relationships

174

between microbes and environmental measures and health effects (Sinigalliano et al. 2010). The current

175

manuscript complements these earlier publications by reporting the results from the daily composite

176

samples, comparing microbiological and environmental measurements, as well as evaluating combined

177

human illness rates corresponding to the daily composite samples. The results from the daily composite

178

samples have not been reported elsewhere. Due to the fewer number and larger sample sizes of the daily

179

composite samples, many more microbiological measures were included in the analyses allowing for the

180

comparisons between a much broader range of microbes. In this manuscript, illness among individual

181

participants was combined on a daily basis (number of participants who became ill relative to the total

182

number of participants per day), and then excess illness was computed (average daily difference in

183

percentages for gastrointestinal, skin, and acute respiratory febrile illnesses between bathers and non-

184

bathers). This approach yields, however, an underestimate of risk due to the misclassification of exposure

185

(i.e. the assignment of a single daily microbial exposure value to multiple bathers with different exposures

186

albeit on the same day) (Fleisher et al. 1993). Nevertheless this approach provides an alternative

187

perspective to monitoring and hence beach regulation through compositing samples over several hours

188

and from different locations as opposed to grab sampling.

Sample collection and measurement of physical–chemical parameters

191

Fifteen sampling events were conducted on 15 different sampling days ranging from December 2007 to

192

June 2008 as part of the BEACHES study described above. Sampling occurred over the study day span

193

of 3.5 hours starting at approximately 8:00 am and ending at 11:30 am local time. Two sets of composite

194

water samples were collected and analyzed per sampling day: “bather-collected composite” and

195

“investigator-collected composite”. Bathers (30-60 per sampling day), assigned to spend 15 minutes in

196

the water, each collected 5 L water samples in pre-sterilized sampling containers. These bathers collected

197

samples from their sampling zone (area of exposure) at knee depth, which varied with tide (Figure 1).

198

Bathers were trained (asked to conduct a thorough pre-rinse of the sample container, avoid touching the

199

inside of the container, and to sample just below the surface of the water, etc) on how to collect the water

200

sample to minimize variation between bathers.

201

One liter of each of these samples was added to a 50 L pre-sterilized carboy, and this sample (30 to 50 L)

202

was called the “bather-collected composite”. When there were greater than 50 bathers, smaller sample

203

aliquots (0.8 L) were added to the 50L carboy to not exceed the carboy capacity. The remaining 4 L

204

collected by bathers was also analyzed individually on a “per bather basis” and was thus not composited;

205

the analysis of the remaining 4 L has been discussed elsewhere (See Fleisher et al. 2010 and Sinigalliano

206

et al. 2010).

207
208

Another composite sample was also collected by study staff and called the “investigator-collected

209

composite”. This sample involved collecting two 10 liter water samples at knee depth approximately

210

every 10 minutes from the time the first bather entered the water and throughout the 3.5 hour sampling

211

duration. Investigators collected samples using 5 gallon pre-sterilized buckets supported by a float.

212

Sample collection was done in a manner as to minimize sediment disturbance and minimize

213

contamination from the investigators by standing downstream of the sampling location. These 10 L

214

aliquots were pooled into two 250-L sterilized plastic drums by pouring approximately 5 L from each

215

aliquot into both drums. The total volume of this sample ranged from 200 to 225 L/sampling day. The

216

sampling transect for the investigator-collected composite samples was approximately 10 m away from

217

the bather sampling zone where the bather-collected composite samples were collected in order to

218

minimize the impacts from the individual epidemiologic study participants (Figure 1). Both the 50 L

219

bather-collected carboy and 200 to 225 L investigator collected drum were kept in the shade during the

220

3.5 hour sampling time to minimize temperature increase of the sample.

221

Water temperature, pH, salinity and turbidity were measured for the bather-collected composite samples

222

in the field using a YSI probe (600R series sonde,YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) and a turbidimeter

223

(Model 66120-200, VWR, Newark, DE). Additionally, other environmental conditions were obtained

224

from National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (tidal height) and the University of

225

Miami (NSF NIEHS OHH Center Remote Sensing Facilities Core) (rainfall, wind speed, and solar

226

radiation). Solar radiation, tidal height, and wind speed were determined by averaging measured values

227

every 2 to 6 minutes from the time of the first bather-collected sample to the last. Some peaks in microbe

228

measurements were noticed when the majority of sampling for the composites occurred right after peak

229

high tide. This was further analyzed quantitatively by computing the percentage of samples on a given

230

sampling day which were collected beyond peak high tide (post-HT sampling %). For sampling days

231

where sampling did not overlap with peak high tide, this value was set to zero.

232

Concentration and analysis of bather-collected composite samples

233

Bather-collected composites were analyzed for many different microbes, including the EPA-

234

recommended marine bacterial indicator, enterococci, using three methods: membrane filtration (MF),

235

chromogenic substrate (CS), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Additional microbial

236

indicators (fecal coliform, E. coli, C. perfringens by MF and coliphage via single agar layer method)

237

were measured as well as human and dog-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers including

Bacteriodales (B. thetaiotaomicron , UCD, HF8, and dog-specific), human polyomavirus (HPyVs) and

the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium. Pathogens evaluated included: bacteria (S. aureus by MF, Vibrio

240

vulnificus with enrichment by MF and confirmation by PCR) and a low volume concentration method

241

(bilayer method, Abdelzaher et al., 2009) for processing protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.

242

via qPCR) and viruses (pan enterovirus, norovirus, and hepatitis A via qPCR). The volumes analyzed for

243

each microbe, as well as a description of the methods used in the analysis, are summarized in the

electronic supplement to this article..

245

Concentration and analysis of investigator-collected composite samples

246

Investigator-collected composite samples, consisting of two large drums of approximately 225 L, were

247

used to collect samples for pathogen analysis using traditional large volume concentration methods.

248

Filters (Envirochek, PallTM Ann Arbor, MI) obtained from processing the water from one of the drums

249

was used for protozoan analysis (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. via immunomagnetic separation

250

followed by microscopic analysis), while the filter obtained from the second drum (Filterite, PallTM Ann

251

Arbor, MI after acidification of water in the drum) was used for enterovirus analysis via culture. Details

252

of the corresponding analyses methods are included in the electronic supplement to this article.

253

Statistical analysis

254

Data were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and normalized using a log transformation

255

when needed. Parameters that did not meet normality requirements (such as rainfall, post-HT sampling %,

256

pathogens, coliphage, and all of the source tracking markers except Bacteriodales UCD), mostly due to

257

being frequently below detection limits (ie. left censured data), were not evaluated statistically.

258

Parameters that met the normality requirements were analyzed using the following parametric tests: a

259

student t-test was used to determine statistical significance of different results between the different

260

enterococci analysis methods using Excel TM, and a Pearson analysis was conducted using XLSTAT TM to

261

determine correlation coefficients between parameters as well as their statistical significance. The few

RESULTS

265

Health Outcomes

266

The method for assessing illness, as well as other epidemiologic considerations using the individual

267

exposure data, have been previously described (Fleisher et al. 2010). The number of total bathers per day

268

ranged from 29 to 55 (avg = 43±10), while the number of total non-bathers per day ranged from 25 to 60

269

(avg = 43±11). This yielded a total of 652 bathers and 651 non-bathers for the 15 study days. Daily

270

gastrointestinal, skin, and acute febrile respiratory illness reported in follow up interviews ranged from 0

271

to 3, 0 to 9, and 0 to 4 participants for bathers, and 0 to 2, 0 to 2, and 0 to 2 for non-bathers, respectively.

272

The total number of cases over the 15 study days for gastrointestinal, skin, and acute febrile respiratory

273

illness were 31, 47, and 12 for bathers, and 18, 9, and 4 for non-bathers, respectively.

274

Illness rates were computed by subtracting daily illness percentage rates of non-bathers from that of

275

bathers, and termed “excess illness”. Average daily excess illness percentage rates for GI, skin and acute

276

febrile respiratory illness were 2.0± 3.3, 5.6 ± 4.7, and 1.2 ± 2.9 %, respectively (Figure 2). Negative

277

excess illness values represented days in which a higher illness percentage was reported in non-bathers

278

when compared to bathers. Cumulative daily excess health effects (sum of percentages of GI, skin, and

279

respiratory illness) ranged from -7% to 22%.

280

F- coliphage was detected on 3 of the 5 days characterized by the highest excess GI illness (see dotted

281

rectangles on Figure 2). F+ coliphage was not detected in any of the samples, and hence no association

282

was apparent in this study between this microbe and health conditions. The 3 highest levels of

283

Bacteroidales-UCD human marker corresponded to the 3 days characterized by the highest excess skin

284

illness. These 3 days also corresponded to days when enterovirus were detected; 6-24 hour rainfall was

observed during 2 of the 3 days characterized by the highest excess skin illness (see rounded rectangles

286

on Figure 2). The highest excess skin illness level on May 10th also corresponded with the highest values

287

of enterococci measured by qPCR and CS, Bacteroidales dog marker, cumulative pathogens

288

(Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus), and the highest level (2.82 cm) of 6-24 rainfall (see

289

solid rectangles on Figure 2).

290

Environmental parameters

291

The daily values for environmental parameters (pH, salinity, and temperature, turbidity and wind speed)

292

for each of the 15 bather-collected study samples over the 15 study days can be found in the electronic

293

supplement to this article..

294

wind speed were 8 ± 0.3, 35.6 ± 1.4 psu, 26.4 ± 3.0 °C, and 6.7 ± 2.3 m/s, respectively. Solar radiation

295

and tidal height yielded average values of 307 ± 92 W/m2 and 0.35 ± 0.18 m, respectively (Figure 2). The

296

turbidity varied significantly between study days, with a range of 2.8 to 64.4 NTU and an average of 14.5

297

± 14.7 NTU. Rainfall was detected immediately prior to 7 of the 15 sampling dates, and reported as 0-6

298

hr, 6-24 hr, and 24-48 hr rainfall prior to the mean sampling time (Figure 2).

299

Correlations were noted between water temperature and solar radiation, as well as water temperature and

300

turbidity (Table 1). The increase in turbidity in the water with decreasing water temperature may be due

301

to the presence of rainfall which occurs during cloudy conditions and hence decreases solar radiation and

302

water temperature. Solar radiation was also found to correlate with enterococci (CS) (Table 1). Absolute

303

tidal height was not associated with any microbes; however, enterococci (MF) values greater than the

304

regulatory geometric mean value of 35 CFU 100 ml-1 occurred only when sampling was conducted

305

immediately after peak high tide (i.e. post-HT sampling percentage greater than> 0) (see circled areas on

306

Figure 2).

307

Zero to 6 hour rainfall corresponded to elevated levels of turbidity and bacterial indicators: enterococci

308

(MF), E.coli, fecal coliform, and C. perfringens (see light gray shading in Figure 2). Rainfall during the

prior 6 to 24 hours had additional significance. The simultaneous presence of Cryptosporidium spp.,

310

Giardia spp. and enterovirus only occurred after 6 to 24 hr rain events (see medium gray shading in

311

Figure 2). The highest values of enterococci measured by qPCR and CS, Bacteroidales dog marker,

312

cumulative pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus) occurred on May 10th which

313

had the highest level (2.82 cm) of 6-24 rainfall (see solid rectangles on Figure 2).

314

Microbial indicators

315

Enterococci levels in water samples over the 15 sampling days ranged from <2 to 109 CFU 100 ml -1 using

316

MF methods, 11 to 124 MPN 100 ml-1 using chromogenic substrate (CS), and 46 to 2360 GEU 100 ml-1

317

using qPCR (Figure 2). Measured concentrations of enterococci by qPCR were greater than MF

318

(p<0.0001) and CS (p<0.0001) measurements; while measurements by CS were greater (p=0.005) than

319

those by MF. No significant (p<0.05) correlations were noted between each of the enterococci

320

measurement methods, qPCR, MF and CS. Enterococci levels measured by CS correlated with

321

Bacteroidales-UCD levels and the inverse of solar radiation (Table 1). E.coli, fecal coliform, and C.

322

perfringens values ranged from <2 to 83, <2 to 196, and <2 to 1653 CFU100 ml-1, respectively (Figure 2).

323

The maximum values for these three indicators, as well as the second highest value of enterococci (MF),

324

were measured from the March 8 samples which had the highest level of 0-6 hour rainfall of 1.17 cm

325

(Figure 2). Correlations were noted between E.coli and the remaining three indicator bacteria:

326

enterococci (MF), C. perfringens, and fecal coliform (Table 1). C. perfringens also correlated with

327

enterococci (MF) (Table 1). Both F+ and F- coliphage were predominately below detection limits;

328

however, F- coliphage was detected in 4 samples at low concentrations of 0.3 to 1.7 PFU 100 ml -1 (Figure

329

2).

330

MST markers and bacterial pathogens

331

Polyomavirus, B. thetaiotaomicron, and Enterococcus faecium esp gene were detected on 4, 4, and 3 of

332

the sampling days, respectively (Figure 2). Bacteriodales HF8 was predominately below detection limits

with only 2 detects at (5 and 3 GEU 100 ml-1) (Figure 2). Bacteroidales-UCD levels ranged from below

334

detection to 407 GEU 100 ml-1 with an average of 71 GEU 100 ml-1 (Figure 2), and were found to

335

correlate with enterococci (CS) (Table 1). Dog-specific Bacteriodales levels ranged from below detection

336

to 12,900 TSC 100 ml-1 with an average of 1700 TSC 100 ml-1 (Figure 2). S.aureus levels ranged from <2

337

to 24 CFU 100 ml-1 with an average of 9.7 + 7 CFU100 ml-1; V. vulnificus was detected on 11 of the 15

338

sampling days (Figure 2).

339

Protozoan and viral pathogens

340

Using the bilayer concentration method (5 L filtration) and subsequent qPCR analysis, all bather-collected

341

composite samples were below detection limits for both viruses and protozoa. However, for the large-

342

volume investigator-collected composite samples, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and enterovirus

343

were detected on 4, 5, and 5, respectively, of the 15 sampling days (Figure 2).

344

detected did not exceed 2.3 organisms per 100 L (Figure 2).

345

Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and enterovirus only occurred during 3 of the 15 sampling dates.

346

Common environmental conditions during these 3 days were rainfall during the preceding 6 to 24 hours

347

(Figure 2), and sample collection during rising tide. Also of interest was that during these 3 days,

348

enterococci levels by MF were below regulatory thresholds (Figure 2). When enterococci levels

349

exceeded the single sample regulatory standard of 104 CFU ml -1, Giardia spp. was detected, although it

350

was also detected on days when levels were below this regulatory standard.

351

DISCUSSION

352

Properly assessing the safety of recreational bathing waters is an evolving field of study which will

353

continue to require further investigation. The complexity of the non-point source impacted beach system

354

and its components poses a challenge to investigators attempting to make simple associations between

355

environmental parameters, microbe presence, and human health risks in order to ultimately improve

356

beach safety through source remediation and monitoring. The uniqueness of this study was in the

multitude of different parameters that were analyzed along with human health effects, providing a wide

358

“snapshot” of the complex beach system that may be used to further our understanding of the system. To

359

the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study published that includes the analysis of such a wide range of

360

varying parameters at a recreational beach. This is also the first study to measure pathogens concurrently

361

with human health effects in a sub-tropical beach environment. The results of this study should assist in

362

directing future research, but are not sufficient (15 sampling days, beach “snapshots”) to make

363

conclusions in regards to how the system functions or which beach monitoring practices should be taken.

364

Health outcomes

365

Average daily excess illness rates for bathers after subtracting the control group (non-bathers) provided an

366

estimate for the daily health outcomes of bathers during this epidemiologic study (BEACHES) conducted

367

in Miami, FL. These daily average illness rates were therefore compared to the daily average water

368

quality (by analyzing the composite sample made up of water aliquots from each sample collected by

369

individual bathers). This approach does not assess the more precise exposure of the bather to the water in

370

their vicinity at a specific time during the day (by analyzing each water sample collected by each bather

371

during bathing (Sinigalliano et al. 2010; Fleisher et al. 2010)). However, the analysis discussed in this

372

study allowed the investigators to compare health outcomes with a wider range of pathogens, indicator

373

microbes, and microbial source tracking markers, which were not available for the individual water

374

sample collected by each individual bather.

375

Statistically significant correlations between health outcomes and water quality were not identified in this

376

study. However, the data suggest relationships which could not be verified statistically given the limited

377

number of times that samples were positive for many of the water quality parameters.

378

relationship between health outcomes and pathogens that could potentially cause that particular illness

379

may be due to the small samples size (15 samples), the fact that the pathogen causing increased illness in

380

bathers may not be among those analyzed in this study, the inefficiency of the sampling techniques (as

382

increased illness rates are not the result of one specific pathogen.

383

However, a relationship that was alluded to in this study but more strongly supported in Sinigalliano et al.

384

2010, was excess skin illness and prior 24 hour rainfall. The highest rate of skin illness (15.6%) was

observed during the day (May 10) characterized by the highest quantity of 24 hour rainfall. This day was

386

also characterized by the highest enterococci levels as measured by CS and qPCR, the highest levels of

387

Bacteroidales dog marker, the second highest Bacteroidales-UCD human marker, and the presence of

388

multiple pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Giarida spp. and enterovirus). The potential relationship

389

between skin illness and rainfall may be due to the rainfall carrying skin pathogen(s), which were not

390

analyzed for in this study, into the water column. These skin pathogen(s) (which may include

391

unmeasured microbes such as pathogenic helminthes and yeasts detected in another study within the sand

392

at this study beach (Shah et al, in review)) may be transported in a similar fashion as the gastrointestinal

393

protozoan and viral pathogens detected in this current study. However, 24 hour antecedent rainfall did

394

not consistently result in increased skin illness rates, possibly due to impacts from other environmental

395

factors such as tide and solar radiation or due to smaller amounts of rain which may have been

396

insufficient to release the skin pathogens presumably residing in the beach sand. Also of interest is that

397

on May 10, the day characterized by the greatest 24 hour rainfall, the GI illness rate was also elevated

398

(4.2%) which is consistent with the detection of GI-related pathogens, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and

399

enterovirus. However elevated GI illness among bathers was not observed during other days where GI

400

pathogens were detected (e.g. Dec 15 and June 21), thus further emphasizing the complexity between

401

human health outcomes, microbial measures, and environmental parameters at this particular beach site.

402

Another potential relationship that was indicated in this study was that of F-coliphage and gastrointestinal

403

illness (detected during three of the five days characterized by the highest excess GI). F- coliphage was

404

only detected in 4 of the 15 samples, and therefore more sampling would be needed before determining

405

whether or not this association truly exists. Nevertheless, this finding is interesting since F+ coliphage

was the only indicator microbe which showed a correlation with bather GI illness in the only other

407

published non-point source beach epidemiological study besides the BEACHES study, which was

408

conducted in Mission Bay California (Colford et al. 2007). Although F- (somatic) and F+ (male-specific)

409

coliphage are not the same, the fact that they both are bacterial viruses and both showed some (albeit

410

weak) associations with gastrointestinal illness in two separate epidemiologic studies at non-point source

411

study sites suggests that these indicators should be further evaluated. One reason for the lack of detection

412

of F + coliphage in this study may have been due to sample size. In this study, 100 ml samples were

413

concentrated for F+ coliphage, while in the Colford et al. (2007) study, 1 L samples were used, thereby

414

increasing detection limits.

415

Indicator microbes and pathogens

416

Comparison of the different enterococci enumeration methods showed that results from membrane

417

filtration (MF) and the chromogenic substrate (CS) methods were generally below values analyzed by

418

qPCR. Previous studies have also shown that the MF method yields lower values than qPCR (Haughland

419

et al. 2005; Sinigalliano et al. 2007; Abdelzaher et al. 2010); this might be explained by the fact that

420

qPCR will detect target DNA from nonviable and non-culturable cells, whereas the culture-based methods

421

will not. Additionally, enterococci values by MF were generally below values analyzed by the CS

422

method, which may be attributed to the differences in the culture methods; MF requires the formation of a

423

colony on agar-containing media, whereas CS requires the growth of bacteria in liquid media. Significant

424

correlations were not found between these three analysis methods. These findings should be considered

425

when updating regulations to include alternative methods for the analysis of this indicator microbe.

426

The current study did not demonstrate a consistent relationship between indicator microbes and

427

pathogens. Giardia spp and S. aureus were the only pathogens detected when enterococci by MF

428

exceeded the single sample maximum (March 22). Plano et al. (2010) observed S. aureus including

429

methicillin resistant S. aureus in the beach water and sand at this particular study site and attribute the

source to shedding from human bathers. Abdelzaher et al. (2010) also observed detectable levels of

431

Giardia during a set of prior sampling events at this same study site, with the detection of Giardia spp.

432

only when enterococci by MF exceeded the single sample maximum of 104 CFU 100 ml-1. However, in

433

the current study Giardia spp. and other pathogens were also detected when enterococci levels were low.

434

These inconsistencies can be attributed to different transport pathways, and possibly different sources of

435

indicator and pathogens to the beach site. Although human bather shedding and dog and bird feces have

436

been identified as intermittent sources of enterococci to the beach site (Elmir et al. 2007; Elmir et al.

437

2009; Wright et al. 2009), the quantities of these sources are insufficient to account for the persistent

438

elevated levels observed in beach water located near the shore line (Zhu et al. accepted). The cause of

439

these persistent levels of enterococci to the beach study site has been firmly established as the inter-tidal

440

zone at this study beach (Shibata et al. 2004; Wright et al. accepted). The sources of pathogens have not

441

been as firmly established for this study site, although limited studies detecting pathogen presence in sand

442

suggest that they too may originate from the shoreline as discussed below (Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shah

443

et al. in review).

444

Bacterial indicators were elevated after 6 hour rainfall, when samples were taken immediately after high

445

tide and during high turbidity events (which are likely due to the combined effects of rainfall and tide).

446

This finding is consistent with other studies conducted on both this study beach (Shibata et al. 2004;

447

Wright et al. accepted; Abdelzaher et al. 2010) and other non-point source study beaches (Solo-Gabriele

448

et al. 2000; Coulliette & Noble 2008). High bacterial loads detected in runoff samples at the study beach

449

(Wright et al. accepted) indicate that these indicator microbes are washed off from the surface of the

450

beach sand into the water column in significant numbers which could warrant a bather swimming warning

451

if analyzed by regulators within a few hours of the rain event. Elevated levels of indicator microbes also

452

occur through tidal washing of the microbes from the beach sand into the water column, as is evident by

453

elevated indicator levels after peak high tides at the study beach during this study and previous studies

454

(Wright et al. accepted; Abdelzaher et al. 2010; Shibata et al. 2010).

455

In prior studies, pathogens have also been shown to increase in water bodies after rain events (Lipp et al.

456

2001). In this study, pathogens (detected less frequently than indicators, and therefore cautious

457

conclusions should be made about associations with other parameters), seemed to associate with rainfall

458

as well.

459

rainfall occurred 6 to 24 hours prior to sampling. In a prior study (Abdelzaher et al. 2010), at this same

460

study site, pathogens were most frequently detected during a sampling event characterized by significant

461

rainfall during the previous 24 to 48 hours (3.3 cm) as opposed to rainfall during the previous 6 to 24

462

hours. Therefore more work is needed focusing on the pathogen response to the size and timing of

463

antecedent rainfall events.

464

The findings from this study suggest that the pathogens detected in the water may not be mobilized by

465

rainfall-runoff processes from the surface of beach sand as is the case with indicators, but rather are

466

entering the water column via the rain through a different pathway potentially through sand/sediment as

467

well. One possibility is that the pathogens are entering beach water through groundwater as has been

468

suggested to be the case for indicator microbes (Boehm et al. 2004). Rainfall infiltration can induce an

469

increased hydraulic gradient (increase in the groundwater table) which would encourage the movement of

470

groundwater towards the intertidal zone and ultimately out into the water column along the shore.

471

Pathogens present in groundwater could be transported towards the beach water column under these

472

favorable hydraulic conditions. Response times of groundwater inflows are generally slower relative to

473

surface water flow as shown for river systems (Solo-Gabriele & Perkins 1997), and similar effects could

474

be observed along the coastal zone. Thus, if indicators are more abundant at the sediment surface,

475

whereas pathogens are more abundant at depth, it would be reasonable to observe two different response

476

times to storm events: a short response time for indicator microbes (0 to 6 hours) via surface runoff, and

477

longer response times (24 hours) for pathogens via groundwater.

478

Unlike indicators, pathogens were also not associated with either peak or post high tide, but rather were

479

more likely detected when the tide was rising. A review of the literature studying the exchange of water

However, pathogens showed a delayed response with rain, and were specifically detected when

480

from the terrestrial environment to the sea describes that if the density of the ocean water increases above

481

that of the pore water for any reason, pore water can float out of the sediment by gravitational convection

482

in an exchange with denser seawater in a process termed “floating” (Burnett et al. 2003). Such effects can

483

occur through rainfall decreasing the density of the pore water, hence causing a buoyancy differential

484

which would enhance the transport of the pore water potentially containing the pathogens into the water

485

column. In addition, during rising tide, a similar effect would occur as less dense pore water floats out of

486

the sediment in exchange with denser seawater.

487

Thus, the results of this study show that indicators and pathogens are present in the water during different

488

time periods. These observations suggest that indicators and pathogens may enter the water column

489

through different pathways characterized by different response times to rainfall events and tidal

490

conditions. Enterococci was chosen as the recommended marine beach indicator based on prior

491

epidemiologic studies at point source beaches which associated enteroccoci levels with gastrointestinal

492

illness (Cabelli 1983). The assumption behind the existence of this relationship is that enterococci, itself

493

non-pathogenic via waterborne routes, is related to a pollution matrix from human fecal sources which

494

contains pathogens which are causing the detected health outcome. For the case of a beach dominated by

495

point sources of pollution, it is reasonable to assume that the indicators closely track pathogens as their

496

source and transport towards the beach (e.g. via currents) would be similar. However, for the case of non-

497

point sources because of the different sources and possible different potential transport pathways, the

498

indicator and pathogen signal may likely be decoupled (Goodwin et al. 2009), resulting in an inability of

499

indicator microbes to track pathogens thus decoupling the relationship between indicators and health

500

effects. This potential decoupling is supported since a relationship between enterococci levels and

501

gastrointestinal disease has not been established in the limited non-point source beach epidemiologic

502

studies conducted thus far (Colford et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2010).

Recommendations

505

The results of this study are intended to guide further research at non-point source beaches by providing a

506

series of “snapshots” of relevant parameters as opposed to establishing conclusive statements regarding

507

associations between different water quality parameters and health outcomes. This research supports the

508

fact that correlations between water quality and health outcomes (especially in non-point source beaches)

509

are complex, lending support to the need for more comprehensive approaches to beach monitoring and

510

regulation strategies.

511

Such a comprehensive approach should include multiple-target monitoring (including the consideration of

512

multiple microbial targets, measurements of physical-chemical parameters, and hydrometeorologic

513

conditions). Through further sampling of the beach water quality, criteria may be developed, relevant to

514

the study beach conditions, which are based on a combination of targets i.e. elevated enterococci levels

515

plus positive detection for pathogens. In developing such criteria, standards may also reflect cumulative

516

health effects (sum of GI, skin, and respiratory illnesses) as opposed to one specific illness. In addition to

517

strengthening monitoring criteria by assessing multiple targets to reflect the nature of localized

518

conditions, other factors should be taken into account including sampling in worst case scenarios . Along

519

with improved monitoring techniques, improved source prevention of potential non-point sources at the

520

study beach should also be implemented, including: re-nourishing sand, treating runoff or diverting it

521

from bathing areas, installation of showers for bathers to use both pre and post bathing to limit bather

522

shedding and infection after exiting the water, developing an upper limit for the amount of people allowed

523

on the beach, properly sealing waste bins and limiting the access of dogs and other animals in areas where

524

humans recreate. More flexibility should also be incorporated into monitoring and source prevention

525

policies to take advantage of recent developments and discoveries such that study results can be used in

526

a timely fashion to ultimately decrease bather health risk while limiting economic burdens.

Figure 2 - Beach “snapshots” including microbial indicators, pathogen levels, source tracking markers, and excess
illness percentages between bathers and non-bathers rates, and their potential association with environmental
parameters. Data highlighted to indicate possible influence of rainfall. Data circled or with a rectangle to indicate
possible relationships between factors (see results). Excess illness percentage rates of 0% represent sampling days
where there was neither bather nor non-bathers illness/infection while negative values represent days in which the
number of cases in non-bathers exceeded the number in bathers.
