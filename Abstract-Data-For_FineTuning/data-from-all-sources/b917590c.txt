Beaches throughout the Great Lakes are monitored for fecal indicator bacteria (typically Escherichia
coli) in order to protect the public from potential sewage contamination. Currently, there is no
universal standard for sample collection and analysis or results interpretation. Monitoring policies are
developed by individual beach management jurisdictions, and applications are highly variable
across and within lakes, states, and provinces. Extensive research has demonstrated that sampling
decisions for time, depth, number of replicates, frequency of sampling, and laboratory analysis all
influence the results outcome, as well as calculations of the mean and interpretation of the results in
policy decisions. Additional shortcomings to current monitoring approaches include appropriateness
and reliability of currently used indicator bacteria and the overall goal of these monitoring programs.
Current research is attempting to circumvent these complex issues by developing new tools and
methods for beach monitoring. In this review, we highlight the variety of sampling routines used across
the Great Lakes and the extensive body of research that challenges comparisons among beaches.
We also assess the future of Great Lakes monitoring and the advantages and disadvantages of
establishing standards that are evenly applied across all beaches.

Introduction
Water quality monitoring protocols for microbiological sampling
and analysis are highly variable among individual state and
provincial jurisdictions of the US Great Lakes, and these inconsistencies complicate data and beach management comparisons.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and Environment Canada provide criteria for re-sampling and issuing
swimming advisories,1,2 but protocols for sample collection and
analysis are developed by the designated 8 states or province (i.e.,
Ontario Ministry of Health).1,3–10 Most freshwater beaches are
monitored for Escherichia coli (E. coli), as suggested in epidemiological studies;11 however, research has highlighted the variation
of E. coli in surface water along numerous gradients,12–14 such that
data comparisons between states and jurisdictions that have
different approaches for sample collection and analysis are often

erroneous and imprudent. Furthermore, the discrepancies among
locations are problematic for the public, where a posted sign may
be indicating several different levels of health protection.
The issue of beach monitoring and recreational water quality has
received significant publicity in recent years, largely as a result of the
passing of the US Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal
Health (BEACH) Act15 and pending revision of the Canadian
criteria. With this influx of US funding for improving beach health,
monitoring frequency and intensity has increased at many US
coastal beaches, including those on the Great Lakes, resulting in
higher numbers of beach closings and the perception that water
quality is declining.16 Differences in monitoring, analysis, and
management protocols between jurisdictions—e.g., time, depth,
frequency of sampling, number of replicate samples and method of
analysis—complicate general comparisons among beaches and
perhaps result in a less than accurate view of beach health.
In order to make comparisons among different beach jurisdictions around the Great Lakes, the sampling, analysis and
management policies must be considered because there is such
a wide range of approaches. In this paper, we highlight the
differences in protocols and their potential to influence

Environmental impact
Increased interest and investment in recreational water quality have led to a wealth of science assessing indicator bacteria variation.
Throughout the US Great Lakes, extensive research has characterized the considerable influence that sampling protocols have on
indicator bacteria results outcomes. Despite this, standard monitoring approaches across jurisdictions are lacking, leading to uneven
public health protection and misleading perceptions of water quality. As new water quality standards are developed and implemented worldwide, the fixed factors that influence monitoring results should be considered. This manuscript reviews and assembles
research to date to highlight the broad environmental phenomena that influence beach monitoring outcomes and to emphasize the
need for comparable and reliable estimates of beach water quality.

monitoring results, based on recent scientific research. Specifically, we focus on research conducted at Great Lakes beaches in
both the US and Canada and explore the challenges to standardized monitoring protocols, reliable estimates of water
quality, and approaches to improve monitoring accuracy.

Challenges to standardized monitoring
Monitoring protocols are outlined based on schedules, level of
beach activity, history, and whether to apply conservative or
liberal estimates of apparent water quality. Early epidemiological
studies stressed the importance of determining water quality
where and when swimmers were present,11 so samples were
collected in 1.5 m deep water in the early afternoon in the area
where swimmers congregate. The logistics of sampling and
analysis, and also the desire to maximize both public health and
open beaches, often dictate alterations to this sampling approach.
Beach managers are given the general protocol to be followed,
but there is an opportunity for making decisions based on specific
situations and preferences. Extensive research has shown that
some of these decisions have an impact on the results.14,17 Among
the variables that influence the outcome are depth,12,17,18 time,14
location,13 and frequency of sample collection,19 number of
replicates collected,13,20 calculation of the result,21 and management action taken. These are fixed factors that can be controlled
by sampling and analysis protocols. Random factors such as
variation in solar radiation, waves, and current vectors interact
with the fixed factors to exaggerate sample variation and this
monitoring error.22 Attempts to compare water quality results
across the Great Lakes and to standardize monitoring protocols
must first contend with these inconsistencies.

depth gradients. Water samples may be collected in waist-deep or
chest-deep water in order to characterize water quality where
adults are likely to ingest water.11 Samples may alternately be
collected in knee- or ankle-deep water in order to characterize the
area where children are likely to congregate, since they are more
likely to ingest water and more prone to illness associated with
contamination.23 Epidemiological studies and Canadian guidelines have stressed the importance of collecting samples in the
area of highest bather concentration, regardless of depth.1,23 The
US EPA clarified this recommendation with epidemiological
studies based on data from samples collected in chest-deep
water.11,24
A study of depth gradients at beaches along northern Lake
Michigan indicated that samples collected in 30 cm deep water
had more than twice as many instances of E. coli concentrations
(258) above 1000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per 100 ml as
those collected in 60 cm deep water (109), and only a fraction
(2) of the samples collected in 120 cm deep water had such high
concentrations.25 A similar gradient was characterized in Lake
Superior26 and in Lake Ontario, with higher concentrations in
ankle-deep water and lower concentrations in much deeper
water (6 m and 24 m deep).17 This pattern has been attributed
to dilution, shoreline sources of fecal indicator bacteria, and
resuspension of fecal indicator bacteria from sand/sediment
due to wave activity.18 A US EPA study conducted at five
beaches nationwide (including ones at Lake Michigan and the
Detroit River) also found that depth of sampling was highly
significant.27 Nonetheless, beach monitoring protocols have
highly varied sampling depths, with Canadian criteria recommending sampling at both shallow and deep waters;1 and
although the US EPA criteria document does not specify
a depth for sample collection,2 it cites standard methods, which
recommend samples to be collected in the area of greatest
bather load.28 A later US EPA document outlining the guidance
and criteria for funding recommends samples to be collected at
knee depth29 specifically to encourage consistency in sampling
over time.

Time of sample collection

Monitoring programs often incorporate numerous beaches
within a given jurisdiction, so collecting samples at the same time
each day at every beach is not possible. This can influence
monitoring results because fecal indicator bacteria concentrations vary throughout the day. Temporal fluctuations in fecal
indicator bacteria generally follow a pattern of decreasing
concentration from morning to afternoon, which has been
attributed to solar inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria.14 The
solar effect is not constant and not always consistent among
beaches and likely depends on several factors, including cloud
cover, intensity (amount of radiation), season,30 initial concentration, and water characteristics, such as color, organics, and
turbidity.14,31 Rate of solar inactivation could greatly impact
monitoring results depending on the time of day samples were
collected. Some monitoring programs collect samples early in the
morning to accommodate laboratory or personnel schedules,
and in jurisdictions with numerous beaches, samples are
collected over a span of several hours, which may influence
monitoring results.
At a shallow Chicago beach on Lake Michigan, the decline of
E. coli over the course of eight daylight hours was attributed to
solar insolation, and the effect was more pronounced on sunny
than cloudy days.14 At another Lake Michigan beach in Indiana,
this pattern was not generally repeated, and there was no
significant difference between morning and afternoon samples.27
Further, E. coli inactivation was directly related to initial
concentrations,14 indicating that the effect of solar insolation
may be more significant at beaches with higher mean E. coli
concentrations or at shallower beaches with a lesser slope.
Inactivation is also influenced by water turbidity or by the
presence of humic materials, which may offer photoprotection.31
At the same Chicago beach, solar insolation and E. coli
concentrations in deep water (which were very low) were not
even correlated. Because the Indiana beaches had lower mean
concentrations, solar insolation likely had less impact on E. coli,
indicating that time of sampling may not be apparent at beaches
with lower overall means.32
Temporal variation on smaller time scales that is not attributable to solar insolation or to measurement uncertainty has
been demonstrated at marine beaches. At a California beach,
enterococci concentrations fluctuated over periods as short as
10 min, such that samples collected in succession could be below
and then above the criteria for beach closings.33 Another marine
study indicated that the average change in enterococci concentrations between consecutive samples varied by 60% every
10 min; changes between consecutive samples collected every
1 min were not significantly different from the 10 min results.34
Similar high frequency sampling has not been attempted in the
Great Lakes, but high variation in single location intensive
sampling separated by only a few seconds at a Chicago beach
indicates there is likely a similar level of variation.13

3.

Replication

The number of replicate water samples collected during monitoring varies considerably among beaches. The US EPA does not
specify the number of replicate samples required but does

acknowledge that a greater number collected will increase the
precision of the estimate of overall water quality.2 For example,
Michigan requires that three replicate water samples be collected
at each beach;8 a minimum of two replicates is collected at
Chicago beaches,6 and sample locations are evenly spaced. Most
states do not provide guidance on number of replicates, so
a single sample is used for many locations. Much research has
been devoted to characterizing the high variation of E. coli
concentrations in natural waters.13,30 Along with means, variance
in concentration can also be different between beaches. An
intensive study of variation at a Chicago beach indicated that
samples collected in the same location can also be highly variable. In order to obtain 70% precision for samples collected in the
same location, six replicate samples would need to be collected.13
In order to obtain the same precision for concentrations across
the entire 400 m length of beach, 24 replicate samples would need
to be collected. A comparison at a marine beach showed similar
results for enterococci, for sites 50 m apart, 25 replicates would
have to be collected to obtain 80% precision.34
A potential solution that has been suggested to estimate more
accurately the actual bacteria concentration without a significant
increase in associated cost is to composite water samples.20 With
this practice, a number of individual water samples are collected
and composited into one sample prior to laboratory analysis.
This solution is attractive for obtaining an estimate for beach
management, but the practice eliminates an estimation of variation in E. coli concentration, which influences comparisons to
beaches with true replicates.
4.

Sampling frequency

Sampling frequency at individual beaches can range from once
a month to daily, depending on funding, beach priority, and
public health threat. The US EPA and Environment Canada
recommend that beaches be sampled five times monthly at
a minimum, but with recent funding available at US beaches due
to the BEACH Act,15 many Great Lakes states sample their
beaches more frequently. When sample results from an individual beach exceed the criteria set by individual states or
provinces, swimming advisories are issued or beaches are closed,
and often, follow-up testing is conducted. This adaptive
sampling routine is conducted until E. coli concentrations are
again below the advisory/closure threshold. The frequency of
sample collection is related to the percentage of water quality
standard exceedance detected; a study of marine California
beaches showed that overall only 5% of the exceedances were
detected in a once a month sampling strategy.19 Most sampling
strategies are on specified days for logistic purposes, and the
same strategy is employed throughout the swimming season. In
a study of Chicago beaches, it was determined that day of year
explained the greatest amount of variation in E. coli concentrations;35 fecal indicator bacteria tend to increase throughout the
swimming season, and sampling strategies that do not account
for this likely have a higher rate of missed exceedances.
Frequency is typically dictated by level of beach use and
frequency of beach closures, with rarely used beaches and beaches with steady, low concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria
sampled less frequently. The high use, high closure beaches are
sampled more frequently due to the greater potential public

health risk. In fact, US EPA suggests that beaches with low
closure rates and low visitation may be dropped from sampling
programs altogether, or, in other words, left permanently open.29
At the other extreme are beaches that so rarely meet the criteria
for safe swimming that they may be permanently closed to
recreational contact.
5.

Analytical methods

The vast majority of managers of freshwater beaches use E. coli
as their principal fecal indicator bacteria because it was a better
indicator of illness in the original US EPA studies,2 although
enterococci may also be used. The two most commonly used
analytical approaches are membrane filtration and most probable number.36 While these analytical approaches yield similar
results, the confidence intervals are not equivalent, making strict
statistical comparisons less certain.37 Most probable number (the
measurement for the commonly used defined substrate Colilert
method) results have a far wider confidence interval than
membrane filtration results, which make the results less precise.36
However, the ease of use and therefore potential increase in
sampling replication or frequency likely outweigh this shortcoming. Further, use of most probable number is likely sufficient
in regression modeling where the higher variation has less
influence on the results. The two methods have been compared
analytically and results were comparable in side-by-side monitoring comparisons.36
Analytical challenges that influence results outcome include
variation in laboratory requirements and variation in sample
dilutions analyzed among laboratories. States do not necessarily
require that laboratories be certified for sample analysis, so
analytical procedures are not standardized across the Great
Lakes. Also, many laboratories use a single dilution for economic
advantage, which often leads to under- or overestimates of the
bacterial density. High variation within a single beach necessitates
a series of dilutions for many samples.38 The US EPA recommends target counts of between 20 and 80 CFU per 100 ml,39 but
because an estimate of the original population density is not
always known, a wide range of dilutions is desirable to obtain this
outcome. Many laboratories are contracted to analyze a single
dilution.

Criteria for closing beaches
1.

Calculating the mean

Different approaches are taken for calculating and reporting
monitoring results. For Michigan and Chicago beaches,
a geometric mean is calculated for the two or three replicates
collected at each beach each day; for Milwaukee beaches, an
arithmetic mean is calculated for the replicates collected on
individual days. Calculating a geometric mean results in a lower
estimation of E. coli concentration and minimizes the apparent
variation.21 The epidemiological studies conducted by the US
EPA resulted in an estimation of illness risk using a daily
geometric mean,11 and while arguments have been made for
using an arithmetic mean,40 geometric means are commonly used
in health effects studies.21 Data reporting should include individual replicate results in addition to the mean with which
management decisions are made.

2.

Issuing swimming advisories or closing beaches

The single-sample criterion (235 CFU per 100 ml) established by
the US EPA was the result of epidemiological studies conducted
at two freshwater beaches and was calculated based on the
presumptive acceptable illness rate of 10.54 per 1000 swimmers.11
Environment Canada developed a tighter restriction with a water
quality objective of 200 CFU per 100 ml1 (acceptable illness
rate ¼ 9.88/1000 swimmers based on ref. 11). These criteria are
applied differently by jurisdictions around the Great Lakes,
which lead to wide inconsistencies in presumed public health
protection. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a single-sample
result greater than 235 CFU per 100 ml results in the issuing
of a swimming advisory, and a single sample of 1000 CFU per
100 ml (acceptable illness rate ¼ 16.45/1000 swimmers) results in
closing the beach to swimming.3,10 In Minnesota and Ohio,
a single-sample with a result greater than 235 CFU per 100 ml
results in the issuance of a swimming advisory.5,9 In Illinois,
Indiana, and New York, local jurisdictions determine whether to
issue a swimming advisory or close the beach when the 235 CFU
per 100 ml single-sample limit is exceeded.4,6,7 Finally, in Michigan and Ontario, different criteria altogether are used: beaches
are closed when sampling results exceed 300 CFU per 100 ml
(acceptable illness rate ¼ 11.54/1000 swimmers) in Michigan, and
Ontario sets the water quality objective at 100 CFU per 100 ml
(acceptable illness rate ¼ 7.05/1000 swimmers).8,41 Without
a requirement to follow a set standard, public health is unequally
protected among jurisdictions (e.g., ref. 42).
Recent US EPA epidemiology studies have been conducted
along the Great Lakes in an effort to establish a more rapid test
for recreational water quality.43,44 It is difficult to make
comparisons with the E. coli standard for freshwater because the
studies were conducted using enterococci and Bacteroides.
Results indicated a correlation between indicator bacteria and
gastrointestinal illness, but as of yet, the results have not been
used to establish new monitoring criteria. Interestingly, the
results indicated that children were more prone to illness and that
the rapid non-culture based qPCR test45 was a stronger predictor
of gastrointestinal illness than the traditional test.43 Even with
the implementation of a new standard, however, there will be
problems comparing between jurisdictions if the factors
contributing to variation in fecal indicator bacteria results are
not considered.

Challenges to the reliability of monitoring
The indicator
Aside from differences in monitoring approaches among jurisdictions, there are significant challenges to the reliability of the
indicator used and therefore the application for beach management. Despite the close relationship between fecal indicator
bacteria and incidence of illness,11,46 one of the primary challenges to current monitoring standards is the lapse in time
between sample collection and the availability of results, which
has been well-documented.47 Fecal indicator bacteria concentrations are highly variable and change over short time periods,
so at many beaches, the concentration in water can change
significantly during the analysis time.13 Beach management
requires accurate, timely results in order to protect public health,

image, and economic interests. Efforts to develop a more rapid
test have been numerous and varied, and the US EPA has been
field-testing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in
the hopes of developing an epidemiological-based standard.43,44
The US EPA efforts have been directed at potential indicators
such as enterococci and Bacteroides, which require a similar,
lengthy assay. Other approaches, including alternative indicators
or human-specific markers (e.g., enterococcal surface protein
gene, Bacteroides HF, viruses) and decreasing the length of
assays for E. coli, have been proposed, but as of yet, scientifically
acceptable and affordable replacement standards or rapid tests
have not been established.
Natural sources
Further complicating the use of E. coli as a fecal indicator is its
presence in numerous natural settings presumably independent
of recent human fecal contamination. Extensive work on E. coli
in natural environments has been conducted around the Great
Lakes, and positive results have been discovered in as diverse
habitats as beach sand, forest soil, and beach algae.18,48–51 In most
of these studies, a component of the originating source for these
fecal indicator bacteria has been determined, but the population
has not been definitively characterized and typically, human
input has not been established. These random factors have
a significant influence on the outcome of monitoring results and
obscure the goal of the monitoring program.
Fecal indicator bacteria have been identified in high concentrations in beach sand along all five of the Great Lakes.17,18,48,52–55
Concentrations typically exceed those in the beach water, often
by orders of magnitude.18 Further, Whitman and Nevers have
shown that populations in beach sands remain in near homeostasis, suggesting biologically driven density dependency.18
Maximum E. coli concentrations have been recorded as high as
114 000 CFU per gram sand in Lake Ontario,17 300 CFU per
gram dw in Lake Erie,52 1200 CFU per gram sand in Lake
Huron,48 10 000 CFU per gram sand and 9000 CFU per gram
sand in Lake Michigan,18,55 and as high as 1000 CFU per gram
sand in Lake Superior.53 Within the foreshore sand area, E. coli
are abundant to depths of at least 30 cm below the sand
surface,48,56 and populations have been found as far as 40 m
inland from the shoreline in deep, saturated sand.57 Evidence has
shown that with increased wave activity, concentrations in the
water tend to be higher,18,53 indicating that sand is a likely source
of the E. coli being measured in beach water samples.
Another potential source of E. coli to swimming water is
Cladophora, a macrophytic alga that in recent years has formed
massive mats along the nearshore of many Great Lakes beaches.
High concentrations of E. coli have been found in Cladophora
mats around the Great Lakes, sometimes as high as 10 000–
100 000 CFU per gram of Cladophora. Research has shown that
these bacteria have the potential to replicate in these algae mats,
so once there is initial colonization, the population could increase
significantly.58 A study on the population structure of E. coli in
Cladophora indicated a high degree of genetic diversity over time
and space (indicating a loose relationship between Cladophora
and E. coli); also, the E. coli population in the Cladophora was
distinct from strains derived from human and animal sources.59
These results indicate that E. coli derived from Cladophora mats

could potentially increase concentrations in surrounding beach
waters. Further, the pathogens Salmonella and Shigella do not
survive in these algal mats for as long as E. coli,60 which can
persist in experimental mats for several weeks.61
The source of these fecal indicator bacteria in sand, soil, and
algae is unexplained, but microbial testing has linked bacteria in
sand to bird populations and wastewater,17,53,62 and other
potential sources, particularly livestock and other animals, have
also been explored. Recent research has shown that naturalized
E. coli populations can exist in coastal watersheds (e.g., soil,
sand, sediment).50,63 This has important implications for beach
monitoring programs, particularly because these sand populations being washed into the lake may not be linked to human
contamination and therefore may not have the same risk to
human health.
Has water quality changed?
With the passing of the BEACH Act, funding was available for
many Great Lakes beaches to increase their monitoring efforts.
This increase has been associated with broader awareness of the
monitoring programs and greater publicity. The increase in
number of monitoring days has resulted in a corresponding
increase in number of swimming advisories or beach closures.16
As described in the previous sections, comparisons between
states or provinces or even jurisdictions require qualification
because of the wide variety of results being examined.
The BEACH Act required that all recreational beaches on the
Great Lakes monitor for a common indicator, E. coli, starting in
the summer of 2004. Several beaches already had long-standing
and active beach monitoring programs enacted, but with funding, these programs could be expanded. Given the extensive
database of E. coli monitoring results from beaches with longstanding monitoring programs with standard protocols, assessments of the change in water quality and the change in number of
beach closings are possible.
Beaches at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and Indiana Dunes State Park have continuously monitored beach water
quality for 30 years; select beaches were monitored for fecal
coliforms starting in 1978, with more added in the early 1980s.22
The target organism was changed to E. coli in 1990, and there
is a continuous dataset for 1990–2008 for at least 11 beaches.47
Beaches were monitored once a week for several years; sampling
frequency increased in 2004 when additional funding was
received. Using data collected at two Indiana Dunes State Park
beaches, there was no significant increase in number of beach
closings over time using analysis of variance (State Park East
p ¼ 0.370, State Park West p ¼ 0.277), despite an increase in
number of samples collected (Fig. 1). The overall mean did not
increase with an increase in number of days sampled, in fact the
highest means at both beaches were in years prior to the increase
in sampling frequency. The results were similar to those reported
by Rockwell et al.64 using data collected over six years for the
Great Lakes.
Associated with increased interest in beach monitoring, there
have been attempts to minimize beach closures with remediation
activities. Efforts including sand grooming,65 beach grading, and
riparian improvements66 have all aimed at decreasing the
concentrations of indicator bacteria entering the nearshore beach

area. A decrease in annual beach closings has been attributed to
these remediation efforts,66 indicating that water quality is
improving at some Great Lakes beaches.
Comparisons of data over time, across states, and even across
more extensive regions should be approached cautiously with an
understanding of the variations in sampling strategies across and
even within beaches over extended periods of time (Table 1).
Analyses like the one presented here indicate that there is not
necessarily evidence to conclude that water quality at beaches is
declining, rather, the percentage of closures fluctuates year to
year regardless of the overall number of samples collected.
Although there may be both declines and improvements in water
quality at some beaches around the Great Lakes, an overall
change in water quality is hard to assess across such a wide range
of beaches.16 Broad characterizations of water quality should be
qualified with more information about the variation inherent in
these types of analyses.

Future of Great Lakes monitoring
In order to improve accuracy and reliability of beach monitoring
results, each of the existing shortcomings needs to be addressed.
A means of collecting a real-time estimate of microbiological
water quality is the goal for several research approaches
currently being explored.
1.

Rapid tests

Microbiologically focused efforts to address the need for a more
rapid test have included decreasing the analysis time for currently
accepted indicators and also searching for a different, comparable
indicator. The US EPA has conducted several epidemiological
studies at beaches in the Great Lakes using enterococci and
qPCR.43,44 Although E. coli is generally used for monitoring
freshwater beaches, the original epidemiological studies also found
a connection between enterococci and illness rate at freshwater
beaches.11 The laboratory analysis time for qPCR is 3 h or less, and
that analytical time may be decreased with further refinements.67
Alternative indicators of human fecal contamination have been
proposed, both biological and chemical (e.g., human viruses,
586 | J. Environ. Monit., 2010, 12, 581–590

fecal sterols). Often, these indicators are not suitable for routine
monitoring because they are present in very low concentrations,
which require filtering large volumes of beach water, or assays are
lengthy or prohibitively expensive or highly variable in their
success rates.68 Additionally, studies in marine systems indicate
that many of the suggested indicators are not correlated with
currently used fecal indicator bacteria,69,70 so additional epidemiological studies would need to be conducted before using new
indicators for monitoring purposes. For this reason, alternate,
more reliable indicators of human fecal contamination may be
recommended as part of a tiered approach to determine human
risk and to identify sources of the contamination.71
2.

Predictive modeling

Another means of providing real-time estimates of recreational
water quality is by use of empirical predictive models. Using
hydrometeorological data and existing bacteria monitoring data,
predictive models can be developed that estimate current bacteria
concentration. These can range from simple rainfall or sewage
release models to complex regression equations including
numerous predictors.72 In the Great Lakes, several predictive
models have been developed,22 and in three locations they have
been actively used for management purposes. In Indiana, Project
SAFE was developed to nowcast bacteria concentrations at five
beaches near the outfall of a major river source.73 The model
relied on wave height, turbidity at the river outfall, and wind
direction to estimate the probability that the concentration of
E. coli in the water exceeds 235 MPN per 100 ml; the model made
one prediction in the late morning each day. The project was
developed and refined over several years, and it was actively used
as a management tool for two swimming seasons. In Illinois,
Swimcast has been used at two Lake County beaches for
management purposes,74 and along Lake Erie, nowcast has been
used at two Cleveland beaches;75 both of these estimate the
probability that E. coli concentration in the water exceeds the
single-sample criterion.
Empirical predictive models require a reliable database of
existing bacteria monitoring and hydrometeorological data for
developing the model and also refinement and validation during

subsequent swimming seasons. Other Great Lakes locations that
have started to examine the possibility of developing a predictive
model for beach management include a New York beach on
Lake Ontario,76 beaches in Door County, Wisconsin on Lake
Michigan,77 a Chicago beach on Lake Michigan,72 and Detroit
beaches on Lake St Clair.78 Region-wide models have also been
explored,35,77,79 which provide an understanding of the overall
factors influencing extended coastlines even if they are not
refined enough for management purposes.
Researchers are currently exploring improvements in nowcasting and also the potential for forecasting bacteria concentrations on a shorter time scale.80 Although predictive modeling
has been widely promoted by the US EPA and beach managers,
this approach may not be suitable for all beaches. Empirical
predictive models at beaches impacted by a point source can
typically account for a greater amount of the variation in fecal
indicator bacteria, but their accuracy at beaches primarily
influenced by nonpoint sources has been limited. Furthermore,
empirical predictive models currently do not make continuous
measurements, so sudden increases in fecal indicator bacteria
associated with point source releases may not be immediately
detected. Also, models linking fecal indicator bacteria, water
quality, and human pathogens are limited.
Process modeling has been explored at beaches with point
source inputs in efforts to describe the area influenced by high
concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. A study of two creeks
entering southern Lake Michigan indicated that shifts in current
direction that affected the plume direction were important in
predicting high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria at two
beaches.22 The amount of fecal indicator bacteria variation
explained was as high as 70% with an associated predictive
model. Another hydrodynamic model in the same area of
southern Lake Michigan linked the point source contaminants
to the nearshore beach areas and helped to determine that lakewide circulation and shifts in currents were affecting fecal
indicator bacteria concentrations at those locations.81

Source tracking/sanitary surveys

Many scientists have also encouraged the identification of
sources affecting beach water quality. The beaches at which the
US EPA conducted epidemiological studies to develop the
current monitoring standards were all point source impacted
beaches,11 meaning the standards are for beaches with known
human contamination. Scientists and managers have encouraged
future studies to be conducted on nonpoint source contaminated
beaches to determine if the standards still apply. With few of
these types of studies available,69,82 researchers have attempted to
determine where fecal indicator bacteria originate and also if
pathogens harmful to humans are ubiquitous with nonpoint
source contamination. In an extensive review of techniques used
for source tracking, Field and Samadpour concluded that there
are promising methods for determining sources of indicators but
that research is needed on correlations between indicators,
pathogens, and selected markers.68 Similarly, Stoeckel and
Harwood83 advised more research before any individual method
be discarded or universally recommended.
Studies conducted along Lake Ontario used both antimicrobial resistance analysis and rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting of
E. coli to determine that the primary source was from bird
droppings,17,84,85 which has an unknown illness risk for humans.68
A study of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) as an indicator
of sewage contamination at Lake Michigan beaches has discounted its use, as it was widely found in environmental samples
including beach sand, algae, and stream water.86
The US EPA has funded and promoted sanitary surveys at
Great Lakes beaches to determine potential sources of bacterial
contamination,87 and the Ontario Ministry of Health has similarly encouraged environmental surveys and routine beach
surveillance for similar reasons.88 The surveys are particularly
useful at beaches impacted by nonpoint sources because they
consider the range of potential sources within the watershed.87
These assessments are conducted to identify pollution sources

informed decisions for protecting public health.

Standardized or customized monitoring
The argument for standardized monitoring is supported by the
wealth of information presented here; specifically, sources of
variation in monitoring results would be minimized so that all
beaches would provide the same assessment. Such an approach
would increase the accuracy of comparisons across beaches and
regions, with the obvious advantage of detailing improvements
or declines in actual microbiological water quality. Public health
risk could also be more accurately assessed. The epidemiological
studies conducted by the US EPA were specific to a time of day,
sampling depth, and analysis methodology,11 and these should be
followed in order to have a firm understanding of how well public
health is being protected. These sampling criteria are not used
universally, so the specifics of health risks associated with
swimming are not accurately applied where microbial sources
vary. Determining frequency of sampling in a standard protocol
would depend on the additional issue of logistic constraints,
a factor for which standardization is likely not possible. While
economic studies of health risk tradeoffs are helpful to policy
development,89,90 the use of these studies at the local level and in
criteria development is limited.
Standardized monitoring also has numerous problems. The
lack of flexibility would not permit the application of different
and emerging monitoring methods, including empirical
modeling, qPCR, or improvements on most probable number.
Standardized monitoring would be logistically difficult in terms
of time of sampling and frequency and may increase the associated costs if more replicates or personnel were needed to meet the
requirements. Requiring the same analytical approach could
cause financial difficulties if qPCR methods are the standard in
future criteria, based on present costs for this analysis. Further, if
the standard approach was different from past practices, this
would eliminate the comparability of historical data and trends
and compromise the intuitive knowledge of the beach manager,
which has been recognized as an important and accurate influence on closure decisions.42
Currently, monitoring programs across the Great Lakes are
customized to take into account individual beach or management
issues not covered in wider standard protocols. All Great Lakes
beaches must be monitored for microbiological water quality,
and despite the current availability of monitoring funds in the
US, logistical issues would make it difficult for many beach
managers to implement standardized monitoring protocols.
Customized protocols also would have the advantage of
addressing beach specific issues, for example more intensive
sampling near a point source to account for variation across the
beach. Beaches prone to higher concentrations of indicator
bacteria could be sampled more intensively or numerous times
throughout the day in order to minimize risk while maximizing
beach access. Customized monitoring would also benefit
managers and jurisdictions with limited resources that may be
unable to meet the demands of a standardized protocol.
The solution may be a compromise between the two
approaches. In order to use beach monitoring to protect public
health, the issues that need to be considered include (a) the
588 | J. Environ. Monit., 2010, 12, 581–590

source of contamination, (b) health risk, (c) variation in fecal
indicator bacteria concentrations, and (d) level of use for a given
beach. The original US EPA criteria of 19862 in fact promote
a compromise solution that considers all of these factors and
incorporates them into the recommendations. The epidemiological studies were only conducted at beaches impacted by
human contamination,11 so the issue of contamination source
should be addressed with similar studies at beaches primarily
influenced by nonpoint sources. The variation in bacteria
concentrations can be accounted for by calculating the standard
deviation for a given beach and determining a single-sample
criterion,2 an approach not used in any state standards.3,5–10
Finally, the confidence interval of bacteria concentrations at
a given beach can be used to determine the level of health
protection needed.2 This type of approach was also recommended by Kim and Grant, with the suggestion that an analog
(as opposed to binary) scale be used for determining beach
closures/advisories.42 Over time and adaptation of monitoring
programs, the US EPA recommended approach has been disregarded in favor of simplification specifically, using a singlesample criterion (235 CFU per 100 ml) at all beaches. Use of the
original or updated guidelines using state of the art knowledge of
monitoring design, risk, variation and analytical techniques
would permit managers flexibility and would likely minimize
beach closure or advisory events.
Regardless of the monitoring approach taken, the factors
affecting variation in fecal indicator bacteria must be considered
in interpreting monitoring results. Databases should specifically
describe the sampling protocols by recording locations, depths,
and times for sample collection and including all replicate
results. Further, the notification guidelines used at an individual
beach should be clearly identified to beachgoers. Any analysis of
overall beach quality should describe the factors and characteristics likely to influence variation in results in order to clearly
link health risk with fecal indicator bacteria concentration. With
the wealth of data available across the Great Lakes, more
reliable and accurate estimates of real water quality can then be
made, and public health can be more effectively and evenly
protected.
