SUMMARY
We describe an Escherichia coli O157 : H7 outbreak associated with a fresh water lake at a
county park. Campers were surveyed for diarrhoeal illness within 10 days of their visit, and a
case-control study of day visitors was conducted. A confirmed case was a symptomatic person
with a stool culture positive for E. coli O157 : H7 and a probable case was a person with
bloody diarrhoea. Clinical isolates of E. coli O157 were subtyped by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE). In the camper survey, 12 (38 %) of 32 swimmers had a diarrhoeal
illness (relative risk [RR] ¯ 12±4 ; 95 % confidence interval [CI] ¯ 1±7–89±7). For the case-control
study, the 12 cases were more likely than controls to have purposefully ingested lake water
(odds ratio [OR] ¯ 6±9, 95 % CI ¯ 0±9–55±8). The PFGE patterns of six clinical isolates were
indistinguishable. This report further demonstrates that contaminated fresh-water lakes can be
the source of community outbreaks of E. coli O157 : H7.

INTRODUCTION
Escherichia coli O157 : H7 is increasingly recognized as
a cause of sporadic and epidemic gastrointestinal
disease. Most outbreaks have been traced to the
consumption of undercooked ground beef [1–3].
However, other foods [4, 5] and drinking water [6]
have also been implicated. Three recent reports have
demonstrated transmission through swimming water,

including an extended outbreak at a fresh water lake
[7–9].
In July 1993, New York State (NYS) mandated the
reporting of E. coli O157 : H7 infections to local health
departments. On 25 July 1994, a hospital in northern
Dutchess County reported two children with bloody
diarrhoea and a local laboratory reported that stool
cultures from two other symptomatic children were
positive for E. coli O157 : H7. Initial interviews of the
four patients did not reveal any common food
exposures. However, all had swum at a county park
on 17 July 1994. The Dutchess County Department of
Health suspected that transmission had occurred
through swimming water and ordered the park closed

on 25 July. We conducted an investigation to
determine the extent of the outbreak and to identify
the source of infection.

BACKGROUND
The outbreak occurred at a multi-use park in northern
Dutchess County (population 260 000). The park was
open Wednesdays–Sundays from May to October and
on summer weekend days often had more than 1000
visitors. The park has 40 overnight camping sites,
three pavilions for large picnic groups, several baseball
fields, a small lake for rowing and fishing, and a larger
lake for swimming. The swimming lake is approximately 5 acres in area with an average depth of 1±5
metres. The lake is fed by rainwater and a small
stream. Food was not sold at the park.

METHODS
To determine risk factors for illness among persons
who visited the park, we surveyed groups that had
camped at the park in the period 13–24 July,
conducted a case-control study and conducted an
environmental investigation.

hospitals and large paediatric practices after the
outbreak was recognized. Clinical laboratories in the
county were informed of the outbreak and asked to
test all bloody stools for the presence of E. coli
O157 : H7. Health departments in neighbouring
counties were also asked to question persons with
E. coli O157 : H7 infection about visits to the park.
Controls were selected from day visitors to the park
in the period 17–24 July. The park recorded the
licence plate number and number of occupants of over
400 vehicles entering the park during this period. We
obtained the names and addresses of owners of
vehicles registered in New York State (" 99 % of
vehicles). Owners of vehicles with three or more
occupants (vehicles likely to have at least one child)
were randomly selected and telephoned between
1 August and 12 August. Because all case-patients were
under age 14, we randomly selected a well person
under age 14 from each vehicle until we enrolled three
controls per case in three age groups (age ! 5 years,
aged 5–9 years, age 10–14 years). Cases and controls
(or a parent for children under 10 years) completed a
formal questionnaire about swimming and water
consumption at the park, what they had eaten the day
of the visit, where they usually bought groceries,
and what restaurants they had eaten at in the period
10–20 July.

Survey of campers
To quickly assess whether the park was the source of
infection, we surveyed persons by telephone who had
registered to camp at the park in the period 13–24
July. Persons were asked when they had been at the
park, how many adults and children had been in their
party, where they bought their food, and whether
persons in their party had either drunk potable water
from the park of swum in the lake, and whether any
had diarrhoeal illness (& 3 loose stools within 24 h)
within 10 days of their visit. Specific information on
dates of swimming was not obtained for individual
members of these groups.

Case-control study
For this study, we defined a confirmed case-patient as
a symptomatic person with a stool culture positive for
E. coli O157 : H7. A probable case-patient was defined
as a person with bloody diarrhoea and illness onset
within 10 days of visiting the park. Case-patients were
identified through routine laboratory and physician
reports and then by active surveillance of area

Environmental investigation
On 26 July, sanitarians from the Dutchess County
Department of Health reviewed all park operations.
Park supervisors and life guards were interviewed and
campsites and picnic areas were inspected. We
conducted fluorescein dye tests of the septic systems at
the beach bathhouse and park headquarters to test for
cross-connections between the septic system and the
lake. Approximately 250 g of disodium fluorescein
dye (Bruce Color and Chemical Co., Tranquility, NJ)
was flushed down toilets at park headquarters and
bathhouse. For the next 7 days, the lake and area
above the septic systems were visually inspected for
the presence of characteristic green dye.
The Dutchess County Department of Health
routinely collected swimming water samples for
coliform analysis at 2-week intervals from all county
bathing beaches. If any one sample exceeded 2400
faecal coliforms}100 ml water, additional samples
were collected to assess the bacteriological quality of
the water, as required by the NYS sanitary code [10].



Swimming-associated haemorrhagic colitis
Sanitarians reviewed previous water quality tests and
collected potable and lake water samples in the period
26 July–1 August for bacteriologic testing using
standard membrane filter methods [11] and performed
qualitative tests for E. coli (Colilert, Index Corporation, Westbrook, ME) on lake water samples.
Additional water samples were collected and tested
for the presence of E. coli O157 : H7 by filtering
followed by inoculation into trypticase soy broth,
overnight incubation, and plating onto sorbitolMacConkey agar [12].

Laboratory procedures

1–13) and 7 were female. The median incubation
period from the date of park visit to onset of
symptoms was 4±±5 days (range, 1–10 days). All 12
case-patients had bloody diarrhoea, 11 (92 %) experienced abdominal cramps, and 10 (83 %) had fever.
All but 1 case-patient had seen a physician, but 5
probable case-patients did not have a stool culture.
Five children were hospitalized and two developed the
haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (both were confirmed
cases). No deaths occurred and no secondary cases
were identified. One other Dutchess County child who
had not visited the park had E. coli O157 : H7 infection
during the period of the outbreak. No additional
information could be obtained from this patient.

Microbiologic identification
Isolates of E. coli O157 : H7 were obtained from area
laboratories and their identity was confirmed by
conventional biochemical methods at the New York
State Laboratory (Wadsworth Center) [13].

Subtyping of E. coli O157 : H7
Isolates of E. coli O157 : H7 from Dutchess County
residents were tested for the presence of shiga-like
toxins. Park-associated isolates of E. coli O157 : H7
were compared by pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) with a sample of other isolates submitted to
the Wadsworth Center in 1994. Cellular DNA was
digested with SpeI and restriction : fragment-length
polymorphisms (RFLPs) were analysed using methods
previously described [14].

Statistical analysis
Survey data were entered and analysed using Epi Info
software, version 6.0 [15]. Mantel–Haenszel odds
ratios (OR) and Taylor series 95 % confidence
intervals (CI) were computed. In the analysis of the
case-control study, swimming water exposure variables
were analysed individually and in combination.

RESULTS
Descriptive epidemiology
We identified 6 confirmed and 6 probable cases of E.
coli O157 : H7 infection in persons who had visited the
park in the period 17–24 July (Fig. 1). All of the casepatients had visited the park in this period (Fig. 2), all
were under 14 years of age (median age 7 years ; range

Camper survey
We were able to contact leaders of 30 camping parties,
representing 117 (27 %) of 437 persons camping at the
park between 13 July and 24 July. Groups at the park
the week of 13–17 July were compared to groups
visiting 20–24 July. Of persons camping 20–24 July, 13
(20 %) of 65 became ill with diarrhoeal illness within
10 days of visiting the park, compared with 4 (8 %) of
52 persons camping 13–17 July (relative risk [RR] ¯
2±6, 95 % confidence interval [CI] ¯ 0±9–75±0). Among
the groups who camped between 20 July and 24 July,
12 (38 %) of 32 swimmers became ill, compared with
1 (3 %) of 33 persons who did not swim (RR ¯ 12±4 ;
95 %CI ¯ 1±7–89±7). One person reported bloody
diarrhoea and two persons saw their physician. There
were no confirmed cases of E. coli O157 : H7 infection
in this group. None of the persons contacted in the
camper survey was included in the case-control study.

Case-control study
Of 55 persons under 14 years of age contacted to
participate as controls in this study, 9 (16 %) persons
were excluded because they developed diarrhoeal
illness within 10 days of visiting the park. Twelve casepatients were compared with 36 day-visitor controls.
Cases and controls were frequency matched by age
and were similar in sex and date on which they visited
the park. All of the case-patients and 35 (97 %) of 36
controls swam in the lake (Table 1). Only two of the
case-patients reported drinking from any of the
potable water sources at the park. Case-patients were
more likely than controls to have accidentally
swallowed lake water or drunk lake water on purpose,

although this association was not statistically significant. No association was observed between case status
and time spent in the water or swimming with one’s
head under water (data not shown). None of the casepatients had eaten in the same restaurant between 10
July and 20 July, and only one case-patient had eaten
undercooked (pink) ground beef within 10 days of

becoming ill. Only two case-patients shopped at the
same market.

faecal coliforms to be ! 200 cfu}100 ml). Five 1-litre
water samples collected in August tested at the
Wadsworth Center and were negative for E. coli
O157 : H7. Fluorescein dye tests done on the bathhouse and park headquarters septic systems showed
no cross-connections between the septic systems and
the lake.

Bacterial subtyping
E. coli O157 : H7 isolates from 7 Dutchess County
residents, including 6 case-patients, were confirmed by
serotyping. Shiga-like toxin type I and II activity was
found in 5 isolates ; the other 2 isolates had Shiga-like
toxin type II activity. Eleven isolates of E. coli
O157 : H7 were subtyped by PFGE. Isolates from the
6 case-patients and the 1 Dutchess County resident
who did not visit the park had indistinguishable
PFGE patterns (Fig. 3).

beach, pond and campgrounds were clean, well
maintained, and in compliance with sanitary regulations. Toilets and showers were in a bathhouse 20
metres from the beach. Lifeguards did not notice
anything unusual during the weekend of 17 July, but
several lifeguards recalled removing human faeces
from the lake at various times that summer. There was
no livestock within the park’s watershed, although
there were deer and other wild animals in the park. In
the period 10–17 July there was only trace precipitation in Dutchess County.
At 2-week intervals, from 3 May until 12 July 1994,
1-litre samples of lake water were collected and tested
for total coliforms. Except for one date (28 June) these
samples met New York State standards for swimming
water. After the park was closed on 25 July, extensive
testing of the pond and potable water was conducted.
No coliforms were isolated from public potable water
in the park. Of 40 1-litre samples taken from various
places in the swimming lake between 27 July and 1
August, none exceeded 600 cfu}100 ml for total
coliforms or 70 cfu}100 ml for faecal coliforms (NYS
standards for single samples of swimming water
require total coliforms to be ! 2400 cfu}100 ml and

DISCUSSION
We investigated an outbreak of bloody diarrhoea
associated with swimming in a lake. The only common
exposure among case-patients was swimming at the
park between 17 July and 24 July. Among campers in
the park the week of 20–24 July, illness was strongly
associated with swimming, and among day visitors to
the park, case-patients were more likely than controls
to have ingested lake water while swimming. Food
was not sold in the park, nor did any of the casepatients eat in the same restaurant during the 10 days
before the outbreak. There was no evidence of
contamination of potable water or leakage from septic
systems at the park, and the lack of rain prior to the
outbreak made surface runoff an unlikely source of
contamination. Furthermore, there are no cows or
other farm animals kept within the lake watershed,
although deer and other small mammals are present.
We cannot determine whether the lake was contaminated once or repeatedly during the week that
cases were exposed, although PFGE analysis of faecal
isolates supports a single source of infection. None of
the known-case-patients returned to the lake after
they became symptomatic, and so could not have been
a source of repeated contamination. It is possible that
one or more swimmers became ill early in the week
and then returned to the lake later in the week. No
additional cases of E. coli O157 : H7 infection were

reported from Dutchess or neighbouring counties
after the lake was closed.
Although only 12 persons met a case definition,
many persons contacted during the camper survey
and case-control investigation reported having nonbloody diarrhoea following their visit to the park. To
avoid a misclassification bias, we chose a specific case
definition and did not include these persons in the
case-control study. Nevertheless, the high rate of
diarrhoeal illness suggests a larger outbreak than
reflected by confirmed and probable cases. In other
outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by E. coli O157 : H7
infection, rates of non-bloody diarrhoea have varied
from zero to 69 % of cases [16]. We believe as many as
15 % of children who had visited the park during the
outbreak had milder gastrointestinal illness. A high
incidence of mild disease might be explained either by
a low concentration of E. coli O157 : H7 in the
contaminated water and}or by small amounts of
water ingested by swimmers.
Our findings are limited by several methodological
weaknesses. In the camper survey, we did not collect
person-specific information on dates people swam.
Furthermore, members of both camper groups (those
in the park 13–17 July and those in the park 20–24
July) were potentially exposed to contaminated lake
water because the first confirmed case was exposed on
17 July. However, exposure of both groups to
potentially contaminated water would only tend to
reduce the strength of the association between
swimming and illness. In the case control study, there
was a potential for recall bias as well as misclassification bias due to parents inaccurately reporting on
their child’s exposure. These weaknesses are inherent
in outbreak investigations, particularly when the
exposure (putting lake water in one’s mouth) may be
viewed as innocuous. We were also unable to isolate
E. coli O157 : H7 from the environment. Although
there were no other bacterial pathogens identified in
any of the stool samples submitted by the cases, viral
pathogens were not tested for, and it is possible that
some of the illness reported by campers was due to
viral gastroenteritis. Nevertheless, the association
between exposure to lake water and illness in two
studies, the identification of a single strain in all cases,
and the lack of any other common exposure make the
lake the likely route of transmission.
Many viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens have
been implicated in recreational water outbreaks
[17–20]. In the period 1991–2 11 outbreaks of
gastroenteritis associated with recreational water use

were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, of which 6 (55 %) were due to Giardia or
cryptosporidium [21]. In many of these outbreaks, the
most likely source of contamination was other
swimmers. Various behaviours, including putting
one’s head underwater, having water in one’s mouth,
or swallowing water have all been shown to increase
the risk of illness [7, 17].
Are current standards for monitoring fresh water
lakes adequate to prevent illness among swimmers ?
NYS requires that bathing beaches be free of sewage
and untreated sewage discharge, and that the watershed for the beach meets basic sanitary conditions. A
local health authority may require the beach to
monitor bacteriologic water quality, although the
regulations call for measuring indicator organisms
(total or faecal coliforms) that have been shown to
correlate poorly with rates of gastroenteritis in
swimmers [22, 23]. Most studies of gastrointestinal
illness among swimmers have been done either in
marine water or in large lakes with sewage outlets or
commercial boating. The value of monitoring small
lakes for faecal contamination from septic systems or
swimmers has not been studied. Furthermore, current
methods for collecting and testing recreational water
may be insensitive to low concentrations of pathogens
such as E. coli O157 : H7. As is the case in many
bacterial waterborne outbreaks, we were unable to
recover the pathogen from the environment [24].
When is it safe to reopen fresh water lakes after
evidence of faecal contamination ? Many factors,
including water temperature, dilutional effect, currents
and amount of organic matter may affect the survival
and growth of bacteria in lakes. Under laboratory
conditions, E. coli O157 : H7 has been shown to
survive for up to 35 days at 5 °C and 20 °C [6] and
shigella has been shown to survive in water for " 100
days [25]. Because the infectious dose of E. coli
O157 : H7 may be very small [26], recreational water
that meets current standards for indicator organisms
may still have a sufficient density of pathogens to
cause disease. Therefore, it may not be possible to
determine when the risk of disease is sufficiently low to
allow the beach to reopen. In this outbreak, total
coliform levels on scheduled testing dates fell within
acceptable levels. It is not shown whether more
frequent testing would have identified faecal contamination, although in the only other previously
published outbreak of swimming-associated E. coli
O157 : H7 infection, transmission occurred over a 3week period during which time enterococcus counts (a



Swimming-associated haemorrhagic colitis
more specific indicator of human faecal contamination) were mostly within Environmental Protection
Agency standards [7].
Because routine monitoring of recreational water
may not detect faecal contamination by swimmers,
the Dutchess County Department of Health is
promoting proper hygiene for swimmers using the
lake. Pamphlets and posted signs will warn against
drinking lake water and ask that persons suffering
from gastrointestinal disease or infants with dirty
diapers not go in the lake. Changing tables have been
installed in men’s and women’s locker rooms to
encourage parents to change their children’s diapers
away from the beach.
Prompt reporting through routine disease surveillance and the recognition of a common exposure
among the first case-patients led to the identification
of the outbreak. Had local health officials not
recognized this common link between initial casepatients, the lake might have remained open and more
people might have become ill. Physicians and
laboratories should promptly report cases of E. coli
O157 infection to their local health department.
Physicians and local health officials should consider
exposure to recreational fresh water as a possible
vehicle for enteric pathogens, including E. coli
O157 : H7.
