Community gastroenteritis is a common illness in developed countries, and it causes significant associated morbidity and economic costs through visits to medical
practitioners and time taken off from work (1). Communicable disease surveillance predominantly focuses on outbreaks of gastroenteritis rather than on sporadic cases (2).
To facilitate targeting of interventions designed to reduce
the prevalence of community gastroenteritis, a better understanding of the common sources of sporadic gastroenteritis
is required (1).
Recreational swimming can lead to gastrointestinal disease, as demonstrated by many published outbreak studies
(3–12). Fecally transmitted pathogenic microorganisms that
can cause gastroenteritis are often found in fresh and marine
water settings because of contamination from sewage effluent, livestock, urban runoff, and wildlife (13), especially
after rainfall (14; http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/water/threats/

default.asp). In recreational swimming venues, including
swimming pools and spas, such microorganisms may also
be derived from human use of the water (through defecation
and/or shedding) (13).
Several epidemiologic studies have shown recreational
swimming to be a significant risk factor for sporadic gastroenteritis (15–20). Retrospective and prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that
a specific episode of contact with marine or fresh water
can increase the risk of gastroenteritis (21–23). Several
case-control studies have also demonstrated swimming to
be a risk factor for infection by specific pathogens (15–19).
To date, however, no studies have examined the relation
between self-reported sporadic/endemic gastrointestinal illness in a community cohort (both children and adults) and
exposure to a variety of different swim settings over a long
period of time.

The relation between sporadic gastroenteritis and recreational swimming was examined in a cohort of 2,811
people in Melbourne, Australia, over a 15-month period (September 1997–February 1999). Data from a prospective
community-based study of gastroenteritis were used for a Poisson analysis of temporality between reported
swimming (in public or private pools/spas and in marine or freshwater settings) and a highly credible gastroenteritis
(HCG) event. Overall, HCG events were more likely in participants who had swum in a public pool/spa (incidence
rate ratio (IRR) ¼ 1.25, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.10, 1.42; P ¼ 0.001) or river/lake/dam (IRR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI:
1.13, 2.79; P ¼ 0.014) during the previous week or had swum in a public pool/spa (IRR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.46;
P < 0.001) during the previous 2 weeks. Subanalysis by age showed that HCG episodes were also more likely in
adults who had swum in a private pool/spa (IRR ¼ 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.39; P ¼ 0.042) during the previous week or
swum at an ocean/beach (IRR ¼ 1.78, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.81; P ¼ 0.014) during the previous 2 weeks, demonstrating
signiﬁcant associations between all swimming locations and gastrointestinal symptoms. This study showed that
although the incremental risk of recreational swimming is signiﬁcant, it is relatively small.

Our aim in this study was to examine the temporal association between highly credible gastroenteritis (HCG) and
recreational swimming, using data from a large, prospective, longitudinal community-based cohort study of gastroenteritis. Previous analysis of this cohort showed that both
age and time elapsed since the start of the study (a steady
decline in reported HCG occurred during the course of the
study) were related to reported HCG episodes (24). We felt
that an analysis of the role of swimming over and above
these factors might provide additional information about
the burden of sporadic gastroenteritis caused by recreational
swimming in the community.

Data analysis

Deﬁnitions

RESULTS

Participants were considered to have had an episode of
HCG if, during a 24-hour period, they had 2 or more loose
stools; 2 or more episodes of vomiting; 1 loose stool plus
abdominal pain or nausea or vomiting; or 1 episode of vomiting plus abdominal pain or nausea. Episodes of HCG were
deemed to be distinct if the participant had been symptomfree (of vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain) for
6 days or more.
Recreational swimming settings were defined as a public
pool/spa, a private pool/spa, an ocean/beach, or a river/lake/
dam. Participants were asked to record whether they had
swum during the week, on what days, and in which setting.
No information was recorded regarding the length of swimming, how many times the participant had entered the water,
or whether the participant had put his/her head underwater.

Participants

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Water Quality Study was a large community-based
study in Melbourne, Australia, that assessed the relation
between drinking water quality and gastroenteritis. Information was gathered from 600 families in Melbourne from
about September 1997 to February 1999, with each household consisting of at least 4 members comprising 2 or more
children aged 1–15 years. Full details on the study and the
methods used have been reported previously (24). In brief,
the study families completed a health diary each week in
which they recorded information about their recreational
swimming activity, illness, medication, contact with pets,
and travel. All participants were requested to collect stool
samples within 1 week of the onset of any gastroenteritis
episode experienced during the study. Data recording was
suspended for 4 weeks during the 2 Christmas holiday periods (which occur in summer in Australia), splitting the
study observation period into 3 segments of 98, 336, and
42 days.
Ethics approval and informed consent

Of the 2,811 participants, 1,440 (51%) were male; 648
(23%) were under age 6 years, 928 (33%) were between the
ages of 6 and 15 years, and 1,235 (44%) were aged 16 years
or older. Out of a possible 191,148 person-weeks of health
diary data, a total of 173,298 person-weeks of data (91%)
were recorded. Seventeen participants returned no health
diaries for the entirety of the study, which left 2,794 participants for whom data were received.
Gastroenteritis

There were 2,669 cases of HCG during the study (0.80
cases/person/year), with 1,387 (49%) participants reporting
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:1469–1477

Approval for the Water Quality Study was granted by the
Monash Standing Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans. Written informed consent was obtained from
all adult participants at enrollment and from an adult parent
or guardian for all children participating in the study (24).

Taking an ecologic approach, we compared the reporting
of at least 1 HCG event during the study with the participant’s number of swimming episodes in each recreational
swimming setting, using logistic regression. We accounted
for clustering of participants within households by using
robust standard errors.
The temporal association between swimming and gastroenteritis was analyzed with a case-cohort approach. First,
for each of the 476 days of data collection and for each
participant, we evaluated the participant’s history of swimming in the prior 7 days. The same thing was done for
14-day swimming history. Secondly, we identified days on
which an HCG episode had begun, and other days of that
episode were excluded. Thirdly, using Poisson regression,
we compared the swimming history of days that were not
the start of an HCG episode with the swimming history of
days that were the start of an episode. Where there were
missing days in health records or in 7-day or 14-day swimming history, those days were excluded—for example, immediately after the Christmas holiday break. We accounted
for repeated days of recording by participants and clustering
of participants within households by using robust standard
errors at the household level of clustering.
To ensure that the associations found in the analyses were
not being unduly influenced by a particular subgroup of
participants, we performed separate analyses according to
age group, sex, and the frequency of reported swimming and
HCG events (participants were categorized into 4 groups
based on their being frequent swimmers (10 swims or
not) and reporting frequent HCG events (2 or not) during
the study period).
To allow analysis of occasions on which participants swam
while suffering an HCG episode, we created additional variables for occasions when participants swam on the same day
as the start of an HCG episode, within 7 days of the start of an
episode, or within 14 days of the start of an episode. Logistic
regression analysis was used to determine odds ratios.
Two-sided P values of 0.05 were considered significant.
All analyses were undertaken in Stata (Stata Statistical Software, release 10; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas).

no episodes, 749 (27%) participants reporting 1 episode,
579 (21%) reporting 2–4 episodes, and 79 (3%) reporting
5 or more (up to 14) episodes. The age of a participant was
significantly associated with HCG events (P < 0.001). HCG
episodes were reported for 70% of participants aged 0–5
years but only 47% of participants aged 6–15 years and
43% of participants aged 16 years. There was weak evidence that being an adult female was associated with reporting an HCG episode during the study period (P ¼ 0.16) and
with the number of HCG episodes reported (P ¼ 0.05).
Swimming episodes/habits of participants

The number of days on which each participant swam
ranged from 0 to 320, with 2,366 (85%) participants recording swimming on at least 1 day. Public pools/spas were the
most popular swimming setting (Figure 1).
Overall, patterns of swimming frequency were similar for
males and females, but statistically they differed significantly across age groups. Young participants (age <16
years) swam more frequently than others. Considering swim
settings separately, young participants also swam more often in a public swimming pool/spa. Participants aged 6–15
years swam more often in private swimming pools/spas, the
ocean/beaches, and rivers/lakes/dams than did other participants (Figure 1).
More participants swam in rivers/lakes/dams, at the
ocean/beaches, and in private pools/spas during the warmer
seasons and months, but the pattern of swimming in public
pools/spas differed and did not rise as significantly over the
summer months (Figure 2).
Swimming-gastroenteritis relation, by participant

In univariate analysis, swimming at an ocean/beach and
swimming in a private or public pool/spa were associated
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:1469–1477

with reporting of at least 1 HCG episode (Table 1). When the
results were adjusted for age and sex, the number of swims
in a public or private pool/spa remained significantly associated with having developed an HCG episode (Table 1).
Temporal association between swimming and
gastroenteritis

Univariate Poisson analysis confirmed factors related to the
risk of an HCG episode, including age (previously established), sex, and season. Children aged 0–5 years (incidence
rate ratio (IRR) ¼ 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.88,
2.38; P < 0.001) and female participants (IRR ¼ 1.12, 95%
CI: 1.01, 1.24; P ¼ 0.025) were significantly more likely to
have a reported HCG event, and participants who swam during summer (IRR ¼ 0.76, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.86; P < 0.001) or
winter (IRR ¼ 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.84; P < 0.001) were less
likely to have a reported HCG event. All swimming exposures
were found to be associated with HCG in univariate analysis
(Table 2). Adjusting for age, sex, season, and the amount of
time that had elapsed in the study made little difference in
these associations, except for swimming in a public pool/spa;
this latter change was attributable largely to confounding
by age (Table 2, ‘‘Adjusted 1’’ results). Additional adjustment
for other swimming exposures (Table 2, ‘‘Adjusted 2’’ results)
revealed that, except for swimming in a public pool/spa, the
risk of HCG following swimming in a specific setting was
influenced by a person’s history of swimming in other settings. This analysis revealed that participants were at significantly increased risk of an HCG episode if they had swum in
a public pool/spa or river/lake/dam during the previous 7 days
or in a public pool/spa during the previous 14 days (Table 2,
‘‘Adjusted 2’’ results). Similar results were observed for all
analyses, regardless of whether we were examining swimming during the 7 days prior to HCG onset or swimming
during the 14 days prior to HCG onset.

1472 Dale et al.

The results of subgroup analyses were broadly similar to
those presented in Table 2. They showed that adults had an
increased risk of commencing an HCG episode during the
week following swimming in a private pool/spa (IRR ¼
1.56, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.39; P ¼ 0.04) and during the 2 weeks
following swimming at the ocean/beach (IRR ¼ 1.78, 95%
CI: 1.12, 2.81; P ¼ 0.01).
Of 2,623 HCG episodes recorded during the study, on 140
occasions a participant swam on the same day as the start of
an HCG episode; on 218 occasions, the participant swam
within the following 7 days, and on 229 occasions the participant swam within the following 14 days. Compared with
adults, children aged 0–5 years had an increased likelihood
of reportedly swimming on the same day as the start of an
HCG episode (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.84, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.94;
P ¼ 0.011) or within the next 7 days (OR ¼ 1.87, 95% CI:
1.24, 2.83; P ¼ 0.003) or 14 days (OR ¼ 1.87, 95% CI: 1.24,

2.82; P ¼ 0.003). Participants aged 5–16 years also had an
increased likelihood of reportedly swimming on the same
day as the start of an HCG event (OR ¼ 1.96, 95% CI: 1.20,
3.22; P ¼ 0.008) or within the next 7 days (OR ¼ 2.39, 95%
CI: 1.60, 3.58; P < 0.001) or 14 days (OR ¼ 2.65, 95% CI:
1.78, 3.95; P < 0.001).
DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this was the first prospective longitudinal cohort study to examine the temporal association
between community gastroenteritis and swimming over a
15-month period. The findings from this study confirm that
recreational swimming in treated, fresh, and marine water is
associated with an increased risk of episodes of HCG. The
results revealed the most significant association between
HCG and swimming to occur among participants who had

swum in a river/lake/dam during the prior 7 days or in
a public pool/spa during the prior 7 or 14 days (Table 2).
Analysis by age group also revealed a significant association
between HCG and swimming among adults who had swum
in a private pool/spa in the prior 7 days or at the ocean/beach
in the prior 14 days.
Although the association between sporadic communitybased gastroenteritis and recreational swimming is not
a new finding, previous studies have largely been prospecAm J Epidemiol 2009;170:1469–1477

tive or retrospective cohort studies (21, 22, 25) or randomized controlled trials (23) that have focused only on the
effects of 1 specific swimming episode in a marine or freshwater environment on the risk of gastroenteritis. Several
case-control studies have also been performed, but those
studies have only considered gastroenteritis patients with
laboratory-confirmed infections (15–19). This study was
unique in that it was a prospective cohort study carried
out over a 15-month period involving both children and

other times of the year. In addition, the information recorded
during summer was limited because data recording was
suspended for 4 weeks over the 2 Christmas holiday periods.
We recognize that much recreational swimming may have
occurred during this time; however, we expected that many
people would be away from home during this period, so the
decision was made to suspend recording.
The relation between sporadic gastroenteritis and swimming is likely to be complex. As the World Health Organization noted in its recreational water guidelines, the risk of
‘‘infection or disease depends upon the specific pathogen,
the form in which it is encountered, the conditions of exposure, and the host’s susceptibility and immune status’’ (13,
p. 53). For these reasons, a straightforward linear association between swimming events and HCG is not expected
and was not seen in our study. The extent to which prior
immunity affects the swimming-gastroenteritis association
is uncertain; more frequent water use may increase the overall level of exposure, but it may also confer some resistance
to infection on a per-event basis (33). Additionally, the duration of water exposure and other factors, such as whether
water was swallowed, can play a role in the relation (34);
however, our study did not include collection of such detailed information.
Other studies have found Cryptosporidium and Giardia
to be most often associated with treated water such as
swimming-pool water (8, 35–37), and freshwater and
marine venues have a higher proportion of outbreaks caused
by bacterial and viral etiologic agents (3). No recreational
water quality testing was performed in our study. Although
microbiologic analyses of fecal samples were performed,
samples were collected for only 27% of HCG events, and
pathogens were detected infrequently in laboratory testing
(25% of samples submitted). Therefore, we did not attempt
to analyze the data for associations between swimming
events and specific pathogens. The incubation periods for
the most common pathogens reported to cause or be associated with gastroenteritis and recreational water exposure,
as well as the precedent set by other studies (38, 39), led us
to consider swimming activity that occurred both 7 days and
14 days before an HCG event as significant. Overall, results
obtained using these 2 time intervals were similar.
One outbreak of cryptosporidiosis was identified during
the study from contamination of a public swimming pool.
This outbreak occurred during February and March of 1998
and has been previously reported (40). The 11 cases of
cryptosporidiosis in this outbreak were not identified by
routine communicable disease surveillance, and no affected
person visited a medical practitioner; rather, the cases were
identified as an outbreak by the study investigators only
because submission of fecal specimens was encouraged as
part of the study. Since linkage of the cases would not have
been identified under normal surveillance conditions, these
cases were treated as if they were sporadic and were not
excluded from the analysis. Indeed, many cases of gastroenteritis that are classified as sporadic may actually be part
of unidentified clusters or outbreaks. It is well recognized
that most cases of gastroenteritis do not come to the attention of health-care providers or surveillance units, as surveillance has low sensitivity for detection of gastroenteritis

adults, and it considered multiple swimming exposures
(public and private pools/spas and marine and freshwater
settings).
The study relied on self-reported gastroenteritis symptoms. We acknowledge that self-reporting may have produced over- or underestimation of the true number of
HCG events because of misclassification of symptoms not
due to infectious gastroenteritis; however, the use of a relatively stringent definition for HCG should have minimized
this (24). In addition, the rate of sporadic gastroenteritis
detected in the study (0.80 cases/person/year) was consistent with rates found in other community-based studies
(26–29).
The risks of reporting an HCG event were similar regardless of the swim setting. However, only for the most commonly reported swim setting, swimming in a public pool/
spa, was the association between swimming and HCG
events found to be significant in all age groups and both
sexes. Swimming is only 1 of multiple risk factors for sporadic gastroenteritis. Certain foods and drinking-water sources (18), person-to-person contact (19), and travel (17, 30)
have all been associated with sporadic gastroenteritis as
well. Therefore, it is unsurprising that although we found
that recreational swimming in public/private pools, fresh
water, and marine water were all significant predictors of
an HCG episode, the size of the association was not large.
Participants generally had only a 1–2 times’ increased likelihood of reporting an HCG event during the 7 or 14 days
following swimming in any setting.
We considered the effects of several factors on the
swimming-HCG association during the study, including
age, sex, season, and history of swimming in other settings.
The risk of HCG following swimming in a public pool/spa
was influenced by age, with a high percentage of children
aged 0–5 years swimming in public pools/spas and, as previous research has found (25, 28, 29, 31, 32), younger age
groups being the most likely to suffer from HCG events. For
all other swim settings, however, the risk of an HCG event
following swimming was most influenced, in our analysis,
by a participant’s history of swimming in other settings
(Table 2, ‘‘Adjusted 2’’ results). A participant’s history of
swimming in public pools/spas, for example, contributed to
the unadjusted association seen between all other swimming
exposures and HCG. This is perhaps not surprising, given its
status as the most common exposure; however, adjusting for
river/lake/dam swimming also partly explained the association. As can be seen in Figure 2, increased river/lake/dam
swimming coincided with increases in both ocean and private pool/spa swimming over the summer months, whereas
public pool/spa exposure followed a different pattern
throughout the study period. There does not appear to have
been a significant increase in public pool use during summer, as there was for other recreational settings; this may
have been due to the relatively high proportion (56%) of
children under age 16 years in our study and the fact that
many Australian children take swimming lessons in public
pools during the school year (and then cease over the summer holidays). Alternatively, it may be that some participants preferred to swim in outdoor settings, such as the
beach/ocean, during summer and at indoor public pools at



Recreational Swimming and Sporadic Gastroenteritis

radic gastroenteritis and swimming and the health benefits
that recreational swimming confers (46), it is important that
these preventive efforts be continued in all swim settings.
The likely increase in extreme weather events due to climate
change (47)—sea-level rise and an increased frequency of
floods and heavy precipitation—may lead to an increased
risk of waterborne disease through an increase in contaminated stormwater runoff and challenges to existing infrastructure (48). Thus, preventive efforts for ensuring recreational
water quality will remain important in the future.

The Water Quality Study was conducted by the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash
University, and the Melbourne Water Corporation under
the auspices of the Cooperative Research Centre for Water
Quality and Treatment. Several agencies provided financial
support for the initial study, including the Cooperative
Research Centre for Water Quality and Treatment; the Water
Services Association of Australia; the Melbourne Water Corporation; South East Water Limited; Yarra Valley Water
Limited; City West Water Limited; and the Department of
Human Services, Victoria. M. H. was supported by a scholarship from the National Health and Medical Research Council
and the Australian government’s Cooperative Research Centres Program. K. D. received support from the Victorian
Public Health Training Scheme.

outbreaks (41). Since an outbreak is usually defined as 2 or
more cases linked to a common source or event, it may only
take 1 case of gastroenteritis remaining unreported for an
outbreak to be missed (42, 43).
While potentially confounding factors such as household
clustering, age, sex, and swimming in other settings were
taken into account during analysis, we acknowledge that
there may have been other possible confounding influences
that we were not able to consider. Since most participants
lived in a defined area and all of them were of similar socioeconomic status, we were unable to consider the effect of
socioeconomic factors. In addition, adjustment for child day
care and animal contact was not performed. It is also conceivable that certain behaviors that are associated with
swimming at recreational water venues may have also affected gastroenteritis risk. Increased person-to-person contact, consumption of certain foods, use of public facilities,
and even contact with intertidal beach sand (44), for example, are all potential sources of pathogens that may have
confounded the relation.
Another acknowledged limitation of the study is that, as
Figure 2 shows, the rate of reported HCG declined throughout the study, for an unknown reason. However, the rate of
participant reporting for other factors, including swimming,
did not decline; thus, although diminishing participant motivation may have contributed to the decline in reported
HCG events, it is also possible that fewer events were experienced (24).
Using temporal information on HCG episodes and swimming activity, we were able to reveal that on many occasions
participants swam while they were ill. Younger participants,
in particular, were significantly more likely to swim on the
same day as the start of an HCG episode (although a limitation of our data was that we were unable to know whether
a participant swam before or after the onset of symptoms on
that day) or within the following 7 or 14 days. Depending on
the causative organism, the infectious period may begin
prior to the onset of symptoms, may peak during the symptomatic period, and may continue for days or weeks after
symptoms have resolved. It is important that public education about the importance of avoiding swimming during
gastrointestinal illness be reinforced (3).
The quality of recreational water in Melbourne is controlled using a preventive risk management approach to
‘‘assure safety at [the] point of use’’ (45, p. 1-1) and prevent
the occurrence of waterborne gastrointestinal disease. Public health authorities in Melbourne generally recommend
that people suffering from diarrhea not use public pools
until at least 1 week after their symptoms have cleared. If
someone is known to have had cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis as the cause of diarrhea, they are advised not to swim
for at least 2 weeks after symptoms have resolved. However,
levels of compliance with this advice are unknown. Additionally, there are no specific recommendations regarding
gastroenteritis and swimming in oceans, beaches, rivers,
or dams.
In conclusion, this study showed that recreational swimming in a variety of settings may contribute to the risk of
sporadic gastroenteritis; however, the incremental risk is
relatively small. Given the likely association between spo-
