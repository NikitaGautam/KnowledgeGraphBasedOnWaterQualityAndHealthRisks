A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in in Melbourne, Australia, to
determine the contribution of drinking water to gastroenteritis. Melbourne is one of the few major
cities in the world that draws drinking water from a protected forest catchment with minimal
water treatment (chlorination only). Six hundred families were randomly allocated to receive either
real or sham water treatment units (WTUs) installed in their kitchen. Real units were designed to
remove viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Study participants completed a weekly health diary reporting gastrointestinal symptoms during the 68-week observation period. There were 2,669 cases of
highly credible gastroenteritis (HCG) during the study (0.80 cases/person/year). The ratio of HCG
episode rates for the real WTU group compared to the sham WTU group was 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.85–1.15, p = 0.85). We collected 795 fecal specimens from participants with gastroenteritis, and pathogens were not more significantly common in the sham WTU group. We
found no evidence of waterborne disease in Melbourne. The application of this methodology to
other water supplies will provide a better understanding of the relationship between human health
and water quality. Key words: double-blind randomized trails, drinking water quality, gastroenteritis, waterborne disease. Environ Health Perspect 109:773–778 (2001). [Online 1 August 2001]

The provision of high-quality drinking water
is a fundamental element of good public
health. Recently, a number of investigative
studies and outbreaks of waterborne disease
have raised concern about the safety of drinking water supplies in developed nations (1–5).
Perhaps of most concern are two randomized
but unblinded trials that suggested drinking
water meeting conventional standards may
cause between 14 and 34% of gastroenteritis
in the community (1,2). In the United States
this would imply that between 39 and 96 million cases of gastroenteritis each year are
attributable to drinking water, based on a
recent estimate of the incidence of gastroenteritis (6). The view that substantial endemic
waterborne disease may exist is also supported
by quantitative microbial risk assessment
modeling data on Cryptosporidium oocysts in
U.S. public water supplies, although there are
many uncertainties in such estimates. (7).
These concerns have stimulated research
on the impact of microbiological water
quality on public health, as governments
around the world seek to establish a sound
scientific basis for water-quality regulation.
This paper reports the results of the first
randomized, double-blinded trial investigating waterborne disease. This trial was
designed to determine whether microorganisms in a surface water supply with minimal
treatment play a significant role in gastroenteritis in the community, thus providing an
estimate of waterborne disease rates.

Methods
Setting and study description. The Water
Quality Study was a double-blinded,
Environmental Health Perspectives

randomized, controlled trial conducted in
Melbourne, Australia, between September
1997 and February 1999. Six hundred families were randomly allocated to receive either
real or sham water treatment units (WTUs)
installed in their kitchen. Individuals used
the water from these units as their main supply of drinking water during the study. The
study received approval from the Monash
University Standing Committee on Ethics in
Research on Humans. Written informed
consent was obtained from all adult participants and on behalf of child participants
before participation in the study.
Ninety percent of Melbourne’s drinking
water is drawn from protected forest catchments with no farming, human habitation,
or recreational activity. The area studied in
this report draws all of its water from these
catchments. The water is stored in large
reservoirs for a minimum of 12 months
before use and is chlorinated but not filtered
before distribution through an enclosed system of storage tanks and pipes.
Eligibility and recruitment. To be eligible, families had to reside in the study area,
have at least four eligible family members,
including two children 1–15 years of age (as
of 1 July 1997), and own or be purchasing
their home. Home ownership was required, as
the WTUs were plumbed into the household
water pipes. The average rate of home ownership in Melbourne is > 73%, and the rate in
the study area was > 80%. Each participant
also had to consume at least one glass of tap
water per day. Families with children were
chosen because children experience higher
rates of gastroenteritis than adults, thus

increasing the statistical power of the study.
Individuals were excluded if they were
immunocompromised, had a chronic diarrheal illness, or were on long-term antibiotic
therapy.
The study area contained 62,029 households, of which 10,918 met the demographic and home ownership criteria above.
Invitations to participate were distributed by
mail; through primary schools, child-care
centers, maternal health centers, and shopping malls; and through advertisements in
local newspapers. Interested families were
invited to telephone the study center if they
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eligible families were mailed a detailed information
booklet and were then visited at home and
enrolled in the study.
Definition of gastroenteritis. The primary end point of the study was highly credible gastroenteritis (HCG). The criteria for
HCG were decided before data collection
began. HCG was defined as any of the following symptoms in a 24-hr period: two or
more loose stools, two or more episodes of
vomiting, one loose stool together with
abdominal pain or nausea or vomiting, or
one episode of vomiting with abdominal
pain or nausea. Cases of HCG were deemed
to be distinct if the participant was symptom
free for 6 days or more.
A less stringent definition of gastroenteritis, similar to the definition of gastroenteritis
used in the Canadian studies (1,2), was also
used in the analysis. The criteria for this secondary definition of gastroenteritis was any

of the following symptoms in a 24-hr period:
two or more loose stools, one loose stool
together with abdominal pain or nausea, one
or more episodes of vomiting, or an episode
of abdominal pain with nausea. Cases were
deemed to be distinct if the participant was
symptom free for 6 days or more.
Data collection. Participants completed a
health diary for each week during the 68week observation period. Data collection was
suspended for two intervals of 4 weeks corresponding to the Christmas (summer) holiday
seasons. Each family had a reporting participant who was responsible for contact with
study staff and ensuring that a health diary
was completed for every family member each
week. The health diary recorded details of
gastrointestinal symptoms, medical treatment, and potential risk factors that may be
associated with gastroenteritis (e.g., swimming, pet ownership). Diaries were returned
by mail to the study center every 4 weeks.
Diaries were then checked for completeness,
and the reporting participant was telephoned
to clarify missing or inconsistent answers.
Health diaries were computer scanned, and
the data files were imported into a Microsoft
Access database (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA, USA). Participants were not
required to complete the health diary for days
when they had been away from home
overnight. Families were deemed noncompliant and were withdrawn from the study if
they failed to return three sequential sets of
diaries (12 weeks of data).
Participants estimated their water consumption on three occasions during the
study. At the end of the study, we asked
reporting participants whether they believed
their WTUs were real or sham, or if they did
not know the type.
Fecal specimens. Participants were asked to
collect fecal specimens during episodes of gastroenteritis. The specimens were analyzed for
Salmonella sp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter
spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia spp., Aeromonas
spp., Plesiomonas spp., Clostridium difficile
(culture and toxin), Giardia, Cryptosporidium,
rotavirus, and adenovirus (8). Pathogenic
Escherichia coli (defined as enteropathogenic,
enteroaggregative, enterotoxigenic, enterohemorrhagic, and enteroinvasive types) were
also characterized (9,10).
Water quality monitoring. Routine
water quality monitoring was performed by
the water utility from sampling points at
customer properties. Samples were tested for
fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and heterotrophic plate count (35–37°C) (11), and
for free chlorine and total chlorine by standard methods (12).
A composite sample from the four water
mains supplying the area was collected weekly
and analyzed for selected pathogens. Protozoa

774

were concentrated from a 400-L composite
sample using a wound fiberglass cartridge filter (13). A fraction, equivalent to 150 L of
water, was tested by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the
presence of viable Cryptosporidium parvum
oocysts (14) and viable Giardia species cysts
(15). A second 150-L sample equivalent was
purified on a percoll sucrose flotation gradient
and examined by immunofluorescent
microscopy (IMF) for the presence of Giardia
cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts using the
Meridian Hydrofluor Combo detection system (EnSys Inc., Research Triangle Park,
NC, USA). Campylobacter sp. were concentrated by filtration from a 5-L water sample
followed by culture enrichment and detection
by PCR (16). Aeromonas sp. were assayed by
membrane filtration of 100-mL samples, and
Clostridium perfringens spores by membrane
filtration of 200-mL samples (17).
Water treatment units. The real WTUs
consisted of a 1-µm absolute filter to remove
protozoa and an ultraviolet (UV) unit to
inactivate viruses and bacteria (Figure 1). To
ensure effective blinding, the sham WTU
was designed to appear identical to the real
WTU, but had no filtration cartridge and a
plain glass sleeve surrounding the UV source
to prevent transmission of UV light into the
water. Both the real and sham units warmed
the water on standing. All units had a 5
L/min flow-limiting valve and a seal to prevent tampering. The WTUs were plumbed
into the kitchen of each home and provided
water through a separate tap.
The UV unit was a Steriflo SF300
(Contamination Control, Auckland, New
Zealand), which met the disinfection performance specified in the ANSI/NSF
STANDARD 55–1991 (class A, removing
99.9999% of bacteria and 99.99% of
viruses) (18). The filtration unit was a
Memtec Filterite Poly-Fine ARD1 filter (US
Filter, Palm Desert, CA, USA) and met
ASTM 795-62 (19) and ISO 4572 (20),
removing 99.95% of 1-µm particles. The
performance of the units was confirmed by
challenge with Cryptosporidium parvum
oocysts (filter cartridge), and Klebsiella terrigena ATCC 33257 (UV unit; American

Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,
USA). The filter cartridges and UV tubes in
all units were replaced after 10–12 months
operation. A random sample of 10 UV tubes
removed after 12 months operation were
tested for output to verify that UV dose
remained above the required level (18).
Randomization and blinding of water
treatment unit status. Households were allocated a real or sham WTU using a random
number list. Participants and researchers
were blinded to the type of the WTU allocated to each household. The WTUs were
assembled and sealed at a workshop to
ensure that the plumbers installing the
WTUs were not aware of the unit type.
When the units were serviced during the
study, the entire WTU was removed and
replaced by the same type of WTU without
opening the unit at the participant’s home.
Unblinding of the researchers and families
occurred after data collection was complete.
Sample size and statistical analysis. The
primary analysis compared HCG event rates
between the sham and filter group using the
total number of HCG episodes for each individual over his/her observation time. To
account for the correlation between the number of HCG events of individuals within the
same family, we used generalized estimating
equations (21). This implementation
assumed an overdispersed Poisson model for
individuals with an exchangeable correlation

identical but were altered to have no microbiocidal effect. The units were installed under the
kitchen sink, with treated water delivered through

structure within families and with individual
observation time as an offset, and additionally adjusted for age, sex, and region of residence. Further analyses using the family as
the analysis unit provided almost identical
results and are not presented here.
This 68-week study was designed to
detect a reduction of 15–20% in the overall
rate of HCG episodes in the filter group with
at least 80% power across a variety of parameter configurations using a two-sided 5% significance level. Assuming two adults and two
children per family with annual event rates of
0.65 and 1.6 among adults and children,
respectively, in the sham filter group, a total
of 300 families were required. This calculation involved deriving the mean and variance
of the number of HCG episodes per family
and considered each individual’s episode
count as having an overdispersed Poisson distribution in which the variance exceeded the
mean (with overdispersion factors ranging
from 1.2 to 2.0), together with an intrafamily

correlation in number of HCG episodes of up
to 0.4. Maximum power to detect the smallest reduction is achieved if both the intrafamily correlation and the overdispersion are
small—for example, 90% power to detect a
15% reduction when the intrafamily correlation is 0.2, and overdispersion factor is 1.2.
All configurations above achieve at least 80%
power to detect a 20% reduction.

Results
Participants were recruited between February
1997 and August 1997. In all, 74,770 invitation letters and 25,300 pamphlets were distributed, resulting in 1,489 enquiries from
interested families. Information was mailed
to 1,024 families, and 647 of these were eligible and willing to take part. Enrollment visits
were made to 622 families, but 22 were
excluded because they declined to take part
or because it was not feasible to install a
WTU in their home. The 600 families
enrolled represented 5.5% of the families in

the area who fitted the demographic and
home ownership criteria.
The characteristics of the 600 families
and 2,811 participants at randomization are
shown in Table 1. Forty-one families (6.8%)
withdrew from the study—20 from the real
WTU group and 21 from the sham WTU
group. The reasons for withdrawal in the real
WTU groups were moving from study area,
11; divorce/family crisis, 4; noncompliance
with health diaries, 2; serious illness, 1;
kitchen renovation, 1; and disliked taste/odor
of water, 1. For the sham WTU group, the
reasons for withdrawal were moving from
study area, 18; divorce/family crisis, 1; and
noncompliance with health diaries, 2. A total
of 173,298 person-weeks of health diary data
were collected out of a possible 191,148
(90.7% returned).
There were 2,669 cases of HCG during
the study, corresponding to an overall rate of
0.80 cases/person/year. There were 1,317 cases
of HCG in those with real WTUs (0.79/person/year) and 1,352 cases in those with sham
WTUs (0.82 /person/year; Table 2).
The ratio of HCG episode rates for the
real WTU group compared to the sham
WTU group was 0.99 [95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.85–1.15; p = 0.85), with an
estimated intrafamily correlation of 0.31 and
overdispersion factor of 1.85. The HCG
reporting rate decreased steadily over time;
however, the relative effect of the real WTUs
remained constant over time (p = 0.99 for
interaction of group status with tertiles of
observation time; Figure 2). The rate ratios
were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.80–1.11; p = 0.49) for
children younger than 10 years of age and
1.01 (95% CI, 0.83–1.23; p = 0.92) for
individuals older than 10 years of age; these
rate ratios were not significantly different
(interaction p = 0.53; Table 2).
When the less stringent definition of gastroenteritis was used in the analysis, there were
1,754 cases of gastroenteritis in those with real
WTUs (1.05/person/year) and 1,757 cases
those with sham WTUs (1.06/person/year).
The ratio of gastroenteritis episode rates for
the real WTU group compared to the sham
WTU group was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.87–1.16;
p = 0.98).
Health diaries from 11 of the 68 data
collection weeks were manually checked
against the database. Of 513 HCG cases
recorded on the database during these weeks,
1 case was found to be spurious (extraneous
marking on health diary). Six probable cases
were not recorded on the database due to
incorrect completion of the health dairy by
the participant (more than one answer filled
in for a question requiring a single answer).
Laboratory tests of the WTUs demonstrated a 99.999% reduction in viability of
Klebsiella terrigena spores by the UV unit,

and no detectable passage of Cryptosporidium
parvum oocysts after challenge by approximately 2,000 oocysts in 20 L of water. After
12 months of operation, the output from all
of 10 randomly selected UV tubes remained
above the required dose level.
Of the 559 families who completed the
study, 520 (93%) replied to the blinding
questionnaire. Reporting participants most
commonly stated they were unable to guess
the WTU type (Table 3). The number of
reporting participants who correctly guessed
their WTU type (n = 176) was slightly more
than those who incorrectly guessed their
WTU type (n = 133). Only 14% thought
they had a sham WTU.
Participants consumed the majority of
their unboiled water from the WTU. There
was no significant difference in consumption
of water from the WTU between the real and
sham groups (mean 3.2 glasses/day and 3.4
glasses/day, respectively; p = 0.87). There was
also no significant difference in the consumption of normal, unboiled tap water between
the two groups (mean 0.55 glasses/day and
0.58 glasses/day, respectively; p = 0.32).
We collected 795 fecal specimens from
participants with HCG. Pathogens were
identified in 129 specimens (16.2%), with
pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli being
the most common organism (Table 4).
Pathogens were not more significantly common in the sham WTU group.
Fecal coliforms were not detected in
1,167 routine 100-mL water samples collected in the water-quality zones that encompassed the study area. Total coliforms were
detected in 219 samples (18.9%), with 63
samples (5.4%) containing more than 10
colony-forming units (CFU)/100 mL and
the maximum count being 680 CFU/100
mL. Heterotrophic plate counts had a
median of 37 CFU/mL, with 154 (13.2%)
counts exceeding 500 CFU/mL.
Aeromonas sp. were detected in 50% of
68 weekly pooled mains samples, with positive samples having a median of 26
CFU/100 mL and a maximum of 710
CFU/100 mL. One sample was positive for
Campylobacter sp. (week 43), and none were
positive for Clostridium perfringens spores.
Viable Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were
not detected in any of 68 weekly samples by
RT-PCR. All samples were also negative for
Cryptosporidium oocysts by IMF microscopy.
Viable Giardia cysts were detected in two
samples (week 44 and week 49) by RTTable 3. Response to blinding questionnaire.

Free chlorine levels in the distribution
system ranged from 0 to 0.94 mg/L, with a
median of 0.05 mg/L and 90% of samples
having < 0.20 mg/L. Total chlorine levels
ranged from 0.01 to 1.1 mg/L, with a median

Discussion
There was no significant difference in the
incidence of gastroenteritis in families with
real or sham WTUs in our study. This
demonstrates that waterborne pathogens do
not play a major role in gastroenteritis in
Melbourne because removal of microoganisms by point-of-use water treatment made
no detectable difference to the rate of illness.
The low dropout rate and successful
blinding of this study removes the concerns
that hampered the interpretation of the two
earlier randomized studies investigating
water quality and health (1,2). The rigorous
methodology established here will provide a
useful tool to investigate the relationship
between microbiological water quality and
health in other water supplies.
The study was successfully blinded
because only 43 (8%) more families correctly guessed their WTU type than incorrectly guessed their WTU type. This 8%
difference is unlikely to have affected the
validity of our results and is comparable to
or better than other studies where the success
of blinding has been reported (22–24). We
avoided reverse osmosis or carbon filters
because they change the taste of the water.
The low turbidity and color of the water
supply meant that the real WTUs had little
effect on aesthetic characteristics.
The negative results of this study contrast
with two previous unblinded randomized trials in Canada. In the first study, families consuming reverse osmosis (RO)-filtered water
reported 34% less gastroenteritis than families

consuming normal tap water (1). The second
study had four water types: normal tap water,
continuous running tap water, RO-filtered
bottled water, and water bottled immediately
after leaving the treatment plant. The rate of
HCG was up to 19% higher in the tap water
groups compared to the bottled water
groups. The rates of gastroenteritis in the two
bottled water groups were similar, but interpretation of the result was difficult because
50% of the bottled plant water group withdrew due to the taste and odor of the water,
and the data recording period was not identical for all four groups (2). The unblinded
nature of these studies means that the
observed differences in gastroenteritis rates
may have been partly or entirely attributable
to reporting bias.
It should be noted the two Canadian
studies (1,2) were performed in a community
where the water supply was drawn from a
heavily polluted river, although the water was
subjected to conventional water treatment
and filtration in addition to chlorination.
Therefore, the difference in the results
between the Canadian studies and our study
may be due to the differences in the water
supplies rather than differences in study
methodology. The Melbourne catchment is
unusually well protected from human and
animal fecal pollution in comparison to catchments for most major cities in the developed
world. Perhaps only a few cities in North
America, for example, Portland, Oregon, and
Seattle, Washington, could be considered as
having comparable protected catchment areas.
In Melbourne, long detention times in
large reservoirs also provide a substantial
reduction in microbial content before chlorination and distribution to consumers.
Nevertheless, the raw water cannot be
regarded as pathogen free, as typically 45%
of 100-mL prechlorination samples from the
Silvan reservoir and 23% of samples from
the Cardinia reservoir contain fecal coliform
organisms. A recent survey of fecal coliform
prevalence in raw water sources in 24 U.S.
systems with a range of catchment types

The following numbers of specimens were tested: all participants, 795; sham WTU group, 399; and real WTU group, 396.
Ten specimens had two pathogens identified. Pathogenic Escherichia coli were defined as enteropathogenic, enteroaggregative, enterotoxigenic, enterohemorrhagic, or enteroinvasive strains. Pathogens not identified in any fecal specimens were Aeromonas spp., Clostridium difficile (culture and toxin), Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Plesiomonas spp., and
Yersinia spp.

reported an average of 65% of samples were
fecal coliform positive (25).
The reported rate of HCG fell during
our study from 1.37 cases/person/year during
the first 13 weeks to 0.43 cases/person/year
during the last 13 weeks, but the decrease
was the same in the real and sham WTU
groups. We believe this reflects underreporting of gastroenteritis symptoms due to
declining motivation of participants.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that our groups experienced a real decline in
gastroenteritis, perhaps due to behavioral
changes in personal hygiene or food handling as a consequence of being involved in a
study of this nature. Decreases were also
observed in reporting of other health-related
questionnaire items (respiratory symptoms,
medical consultations, medication use), but
not in lifestyle items (travel, presence of
household pets; data not shown). This tends
to support the former explanation for the
decline in reported gastroenteritis rates.
Similar declines have been seen in other
studies (1,2), and it may be advisable for
future studies to use a shorter observation
period with a larger number of participants.
The lower confidence interval around our
point estimate of 0.99 indicates that up to
15% of gastrointestinal disease in Melbourne
could be caused by drinking water. However,
this is unlikely for several reasons, including
the high degree of similarity in the distribution of gastroenteritis episodes in both groups
throughout the study period and the absence
of any history of recognized waterborne outbreaks in Melbourne. The majority of
pathogens isolated during episodes of gastroenteritis were chlorine-sensitive organisms,
which are unlikely to have been transmitted
via a chlorinated water supply. Most of the
Cryptosporidium isolates identified during the
study were attributable to a swimming poolrelated outbreak (26).
Use of a less stringent definition of gastroenteritis resulted in a 32% increase in the
number of recorded gastroenteritis episodes
and also showed no significant difference
between real and sham WTU groups.
However, there was minimal effect on the
size of the confidence interval around the
point estimate as the majority of extra
episodes captured by this definition occurred
in participants who had experienced episodes
under the original definition of HCG. This
indicates that a substantial increase in participant numbers would be required to achieve
a more precise estimate of effect.
During our study, total coliform bacteria
were detected in the water more frequently
than is recommended by the World Health
Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water
Quality (27), the Australian Drinking Water
Guidelines (28), and the relevant U.S.
Environmental Health Perspectives

standards (29). These bacteria are used as
general indicators of water quality and may
include organisms from both fecal and
nonfecal sources. In Melbourne, total coliform bacteria are not detected immediately
downstream of chlorination points nor at
the outflow of suburban storage tanks; however, they are frequently detected at sampling points in the distribution system. It is
believed this represents bacterial growth in
the system rather than survival of organisms
from the source water.
The negative result of our study confirms
previous observations that the presence of total
coliforms is not necessarily associated with disease risks (30). Therefore, increasing the disinfectant residual level in the distribution system
in Melbourne simply to reduce the total coliform count may not be beneficial to community health. The role of high disinfectant
residuals in distribution systems and their efficacy in protecting public health is a topic of
some controversy in the international water
industry (31). In the United States, relatively
high free chlorine residuals (> 0.1 mg/L) are
generally maintained in chlorinated systems,
while in some European countries no residual
is used after primary disinfection (32).
The importance of waterborne disease,
both epidemic and endemic, and the need to
establish better understanding of its occurrence and magnitude, has been recognized
internationally. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is undertaking a research
program that includes trials of a similar
design to the Melbourne study (33), and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development and the World Health
Organization have recently established an
international Expert Working Group to
develop best practice approaches to this issue.
The successful completion of the
Melbourne Water Quality Study with effective blinding and a low dropout rate demonstrates that rigorous epidemiological methods
can be used to assess the impact of water
quality on human health. The application of
the study methodology to other water supplies will provide health and water authorities
with a better understanding of waterborne
disease and its contribition to endemic gastroenteritis. This will allow communities and
regulators to make better informed and more
cost-effective decisions about future water
treatment requirements.
