Biphasic decay has been observed for indicators and pathogens in bench-scale and in-situ water experiments for
decades, however, first-order decay kinetics continue to be applied to persistence data because of their simplicity
and ease of application. Model uncertainty introduced by broadly applying first-order decay kinetics to persis­
tence data may lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection. As surface
waters are exposed to highly variable environmental and water quality factors that influence microbial and viral
persistence, it is expected that first-order decay kinetics are not representative of most of the persistence liter­
ature for indicators and pathogens in surface water matrices. This review compiled the methods and results of 61
studies that conducted experiments evaluating the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacteriophages,
pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoa in natural surface water matrices. The goals of this review were
trifold: (1) collate studies in the literature with data available for future persistence modeling, (2) present the
current state of knowledge with regards to the environmental and water quality factors affecting persistence in
natural surface waters, and (3) identify recurrent evidence for interactions between the frequently studied factors
to inform future factor analyses. Comparing the methods and results across the 61 studies suggest potential
interactions between sunlight and water type; sunlight and method of detection; predation and water type;
predation and temperature; and water type and method of detection. The majority of the identified literature
evaluated FIB or bacteria persistence; future experiments are needed that focus on protozoa, brackish or marine
water types, and molecular-based methods of detection.

1. Introduction
Indicator and pathogen decay in surface waters has typically been
assumed to follow first-order decay kinetics (de Brauwere et al., 2014;
Pachepsky et al., 2006; Crane and Moore, 1986). The simplicity of
models such as the exponential or log-linear model and the ease of their
application continue to motivate the use of first-order decay kinetics for
modeling pathogen fate (Crane and Moore, 1986). However, there is
significant evidence in the literature that challenges the assumption of
first-order decay (Easton et al., 2005; Benham et al., 2006; Pachpesky
et al., 2006; Blaustien et al., 2013; Park et al., 2016). Biphasic decay, in
which there are two stages of decay described by two different
first-order rates, has been observed for a variety of targets (Easton et al.,
2005; Hellweger and Masopust, 2008; Brouwer et al., 2017), and the
fitting of alternative model forms in previous analyses within the Global
Water Pathogens Project suggest models that capture shouldering and
tailing decay dynamics better describe target persistence in various

water matrices (Mitchell and Akram, 2017). Assumptions of first order
decay kinetics can lead to potential underestimations of residual
pathogens.
Deviations from classic linear decay have been hypothesized to be
due to population heterogeneity, resistant states, viable but not cultur­
able states, and possibly quorum sensing effects (Brouwer et al., 2017;
Easton et al., 2005). Additionally, there are a wide range of environ­
mental, water quality, and species-related factors that influence a tar­
get’s persistence in a matrix of concern. It is possible that the application
of first-order decay kinetics for data analysis in prior studies, has limited
our interpretation of the experimental factors influencing persistence.
This is perhaps reflected in distributions of optimized first-order decay
rates that have been shown to be highly variable, spanning orders of
magnitude within pathogen groups (Boehm et al., 2018).
Simplifications in pathogen fate modeling can possibly lead to
erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and pro­
tection, and as such, reducing model uncertainty by applying a more

appropriate model form to indicator and pathogen decay is an important
goal. As natural surface waters are impacted by a number of natural
stressors that impact decay, it is hypothesized that two- or threeparameter persistence models will be more representative of indicator
and pathogen persistence in surface waters in general than traditional
first-order kinetics. Reducing this uncertainty may yield more accurate
decay-metrics that can be used to further explore the relationships be­
tween indicator and pathogen persistence and typical natural stressors,
such as temperature, sunlight, predation, or water composition.
To facilitate the future testing of these hypotheses, this review aims
to evaluate the quantity and quality of indicator and pathogen persis­
tence experiments in surface waters available in the literature that could
be used to explore the implications of first-order decay kinetic as­
sumptions. This is the qualitative summary of the identified literature
and serves to summarize the current state of the knowledge of the water
quality and environmental factors affecting indicator and pathogen
persistence in surface waters. The relevant methods, modeling tech­
niques, and results from each study described herein will aid future
researchers in experimental design and data analysis. This compilation
of experiments and methodologies will facilitate the identification of
potential interactions that can be further explored to reduce un­
certainties associated with pathogen behavior in natural water matrices.

3.1. Fecal indicator bacteria
The majority of the identified literature focused on the persistence or
decay of FIB targets, most commonly Escherichia coli and Enterococcus
spp. Of the 41 studies that addressed FIB persistence, 24 assessed FIB
persistence independently and 17 compared FIB persistence to that of
another target of concern, as shown in Table 1. The majority of the
identified studies focused on freshwater (29/41) and the inclusion of a
light source was a common experimental factor; some or all of the ex­
periments were exposed to light in 25 of the 41 studies. Predation was a
less commonly studied manipulated factor and the methods used in the
41 studies were predominantly culture-based.
3.1.1. Water type
Water type did not consistently affect decay in the identified litera­
ture. Ahmed et al. (2019) explored the relationship between the decay of
molecular-based targets for E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in fresh and
marine mesocosms and although FIB decay was faster in water than
sediment, differences in FIB decay between water types were not noted.
Turbidity and temperature were found to be significantly and positively
associated with FIB decay. Sunlight and pH did not have statistically
significant correlations. The conclusions about water type echoed those
of a previous study that used culture-based methods (Ahmed et al.,
2014), in which nonfiltered marine and fresh water were inoculated
with raw sewage and the first log-reduction (T90s) of E. coli and
enterococci in the two water types were not significantly different.
Water type was a significant factor in two studies employing outdoor
mesocosms (Korajkic et al., 2013, 2019). In general, Korajkic et al.
(2013) observed significantly more decay when indigenous microbiota
were present in the mesocosms, and greater decay in marine water ex­
periments than freshwater experiments regardless of indigenous
microbiota presence. Water type accounted for 40.1% of the variation in
E. coli decay, the presence/absence of indigenous microbiota accounted
for 49.2% of the variation in decay, and interactions between the two
factors (water type and predation) accounted for 9.74% of the variation
(Korajkic et al., 2013). Korajkic et al. (2019) monitored both molecular
and culturable targets for FIB originating from cattle manure in meso­
cosms while manipulating water type, sunlight, and predation. Korajkic
et al. (2019) concluded that water type was the most influential factor
affecting decay, with most targets decaying faster in marine water than
fresh. Additionally, there were clear differences between culture and
molecular target decay patterns in freshwater but not in marine (Kor­
ajkic et al., 2019). Fujioka (1981) studied fecal coliform and fecal
streptococci survival in fresh and marine water and also observed
greater persistence in freshwater than marine.
Jeanneau et al. (2012) observed target-specific water type differ­
ences in microcosms that simulated contamination from a wastewater
input. The T90 of E. coli was 3.4 times lower than in marine water than
freshwater, while the T90s for enterococci in the two water types were
not significantly different (Jeanneau et al., 2012). Water type also had
conflicting effects in a study conducted by Liang et al. (2017). Although
increasing sunlight intensity resulted in increasing decay rates, the ef­
fects of salinity on decay were less obvious; increased salinity was
associated with increased decay in E. coli and decreased decay of
enterococci (Liang et al., 2017). Target-specific salinity effects were also
observed in a study by Okabe and Shimazu (2007), in which increasing
salinity increased the decay of total coliforms in non-filtered river water,
but not fecal coliforms (Okabe and Shimazu, 2007).

2. Selection criteria
For a study to be included in this review, the researchers needed to
sample natural surface waters or conduct the experiments in situ. The
primary objective of this review was the identification of experiments
with data for persistence modeling, and as such, the experiments found
in the literature needed to document target concentrations or logreduction values for at least four time points to be selected, as a mini­
mum of four time points would facilitate the fitting of alternative
persistence models with more than one parameter. Additionally, the
following factors were documented from each study in this review:
target type (fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacteriophages, bacteria, vi­
ruses, protozoa), water type (fresh, marine, brackish), temperature,
sunlight (presence/absence), predation (presence/absence), and
method of detection (culture-based/molecular-based). If a light source
was not mentioned in the study, it was assumed the experiments were
conducted in the dark. If the sampled surface water was filtered or
autoclaved in any way, the dataset was identified as predation absent.
Studies that included experiments with targets not of focus in this review
(MST markers, animal/fish pathogens) were not extracted and included
in the review. This literature review describes the results of each study
qualitatively; in some cases, not all of the experiments included in a
study had enough documented timepoints to facilitate the fitting of
models other than those representing first-order decay. Although all the
experiments are described qualitatively herein, Table 1 only reflects the
characteristics of the experiments that have the aforementioned criteria
that could be leveraged in future analyses of alternative persistence
modeling methods.
3. Results
The systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA
guidelines using the methods outlined in S1. Sixty-one studies of the
3949 identified (Fig. S1) were included in this review and are summa­
rized in Table 1 based on the factors of concern relevant to the experi­
ments within each study that included the necessary detail for modeling.
Experiments were categorized by water type (fresh, marine, brackish),
sunlight (presence/absence), predation (presence/absence), and
method of detection (culture-based/molecular-based). The following
qualitative summaries are divided into target groups: FIB, bacteria, vi­
ruses, bacteriophages, and protozoa.

3.1.2. Sunlight
Sunlight was a commonly evaluated environmental factor in both
bench-scale and in situ experiments. Korajkic et al. (2014) evaluated how
biotic interactions and sunlight influenced FIB persistence in an in situ
mesocosm located near a recreational beach. The culturable FIB decayed
the fastest- there was a strong correlation between the MST markers and
the molecular FIB targets, but not the culturable. The effect of sunlight

frequently studied than estuarine water. Yukselen et al. (2003) evalu­
ated the effects of temperature and solar radiation on coliform bacteria
die-off rates and concluded that sunlight exposure was the most signif­
icant factor affecting decay, and the effect of increasing temperatures
was more pronounced in the dark. Mattioli et al. (2017) looked at FIB
persistence at different water depths in marine water using molecular
and culture-based methods. Both enterococci and E. coli decayed faster
at shallower depths, where more photoinactivation could occur,
although there were some seasonal differences in decay. Noble et al.
(2004) addressed the inactivation of various indicators in seawater;
temperature and sunlight significantly affected decay, but there were no
significant interactions with nutrients, TSS, or initial concentrations.
Maracinni et al. (2016) explored the inactivation of enterococci and
E. coli at different depths (5, 18 and 99 cm) in all three water typesfresh, brackish, and marine. Decay rates were faster in high light con­
ditions than in low light conditions, suggesting endogenous photo­
inactivation is a major pathway for bacterial decay (Maracinni et al.,
2016).

was more pronounced during the initial stages of decay, and over the
course of time biotic interactions had a greater influence on decay than
sunlight. Both sunlight and predation significantly impacted culturable
enterococci, but only sunlight was an influential factor in the decay of
culturable E. coli (Korajkic et al., 2014). Sunlight was also found to be a
primary driver for the inactivation of culturable bacterial indicators in
pond water experiments conducted by Greaves et al. (2020) and for the
freshwater experiments conducted by Bailey et al. (2018). Temperature
and mixing speed, however, were not found to significantly impact FIB
decay (Bailey et al., 2018).
Sunlight did not have a pronounced effect on the relative decay of
MST markers and E. coli in freshwater microcosms where sunlight,
temperature, predation and sediment were manipulated, but the high
turbidity value of the source water (~102 NTU) and the strength of the
artificial light source were noted as potential causes (Dick et al., 2010).
Gutiérrez-Cacciabue et al. (2016) studied the effects of both turbidity
and sunlight on FIB decay in experiments using culture and
molecular-based methods. E. coli and E. faecalis were inoculated into the
environmental water with turbidity values of >900 NTU or <3 NTU.
There was quite a bit of variability depending on the experiment con­
ditions, but in general sunlight presence caused faster decay, as did the
presence of solid particles in the water. The persistence of E. faecalis
DNA was greater than that of the culturable cells (Gutiérrez-Cacciabue
et al., 2016). Sunlight was only found to significantly affect the decay
rates of enterococci as measured with culture-based methods (as
opposed to molecular-based) in the light and dark seawater microcosms
constructed by Walters et al. (2009), and the effects of sunlight were
found to be target-dependent in the study conducted by Walters and
Fields (2009). In mesocosms exploring the decay of MST markers and
human and cattle-associated FIB, light influenced the rate of survival
more so for enterococci than E. coli (Walters and Fields, 2009).
In two of the studies that focused on estuarine water only, sunlight
was a significant factor affecting FIB decay (Bordalo et al., 2002;
Chandran and Mohamed Hatha, 2005). Bordalo et al. (2002) noted that
the effect of sunlight was more prevalent in higher salinity experiments,
suggesting a possible sunlight-water type interaction. Chandran and
Mohamed Hatha (2005) observed significant inactivation of E. coli and
S. typhimurium in estuarine water due to predation and sunlight, but
deemed sunlight the most important inactivating factor (Chandran and
Mohamed Hatha, 2005).
The effects of sunlight on FIB decay in marine water was more

3.1.3. Predation
The effects of predation were also commonly assessed in the studies
identified in the literature. In the experiments already discussed, pre­
dation was associated with significant inactivation of E. coli in fresh,
marine, and estuarine waters (Dick et al., 2010; Korajkic et al., 2013;
Chandra and Hatha, 2005) and culturable enterococci in freshwater
(Korajkic et al., 2014). Chandran et al. (2011) completed microcosm
studies with E. coli, S. paratyphi, and V. parahaemolyticus in freshwater
and sediments. The decay of E. coli in sterile water was slower than that
in nonfiltered water, highlighting a significant effect from the presence
of biological factors. Wanjugi et al. (2016) used E. coli to explore in­
teractions between predation, nutrient levels, and competition on target
survival in river water microcosms set-up in an open greenhouse.
Overall, predation and competition had negative effects on survival,
while nutrient addition increased survival. Specifically, predation
accounted for the greatest amount of decay variation (40%), followed by
nutrients (25%) and competition (15%).
Solecki et al. (2011) compared FIB persistence to the persistence of
various microbial and chemical pig manure markers in dark fresh and
marine microcosms and the observed biphasic decay was hypothesized
to be due to predation, as the waters used were unfiltered. Both generic
and pathogenic E. coli were studied in agricultural surface water

microcosms constructed by Topalcengiz and Danyluk (2019) and the
most rapid decay was observed in the non-sterile waters. Medema et al.
(1997) investigated the persistence of E. coli, Clostridium perfringens, and
enterococci in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were
maintained in the dark. Die-off of E. coli and enterococci were faster in
the natural river water at both tested temperatures, with possible
multiplication of both FIB observed in the autoclaved water maintained
at 15 ◦ C (Medema et al., 1997).
Ahmed et al. (2021) explored the persistence of various targets,
including FIB with culture-based techniques. The mesocosms were
constructed with water sampled from two lakes, either filtered or left
natural, and kept at 15 ◦ C or 25 ◦ C for the experiments. There was not a
pronounced effect from predation, however this was hypothesized to be
likely due to the sewage inoculum which could have introduced pred­
ators to the filtered water experiments. For the E. coli trials, decay was
significantly faster at 25 ◦ C than 15 ◦ C in three of the four microcosms
(Ahmed et al., 2021).

et al., 2019). The majority of the studies found that sunlight significantly
accelerated decay (Bailey et al., 2018; Bordalo et al., 2002; Chandran
and Mohamed Hatha, 2005; Fujioka, 1981; Korajkic et al., 2014;
Gutierrez-Cacciabue et al., 2013; Greaves et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2017;
Maracinni et al., 2016; Mattioli et al., 2017; Noble et al., 2004; Yukselen
et al., 2003), however there were a few studies that determined it was
not a significant factor or found its impact to be variable (Ahmed et al.,
2019; Dick et al., 2010; Korajkic et al., 2019; Walters and Fields 2009;
Walters et al., 2009). This was hypothesized to be due to the water
having a high turbidity or a potential shading issue (Dick et al., 2010;
Korajkic et al., 2019).
In general, increasing temperature was correlated with increasing
decay (Ahmed et al., 2019, 2021; Lund et al., 1996; Easton et al., 2005;
Nasser et al., 2003; Noble et al., 2004; Terzieva and McFeters, 1991;
Yukselen et al., 2003; Medema et al., 1997), however a few studies did
not observe this typical pattern (Bailey et al., 2018; Okabe and Shi­
manzu, 2007). Predation was also commonly found to be a significant
factor affecting decay (Chandran et al., 2005; Chandran et al., 2011;
Dick et al., 2010; Korajkic et al., 2013; Topalcengiz and Danyluk, 2019;
Wanjugi et al., 2016; Medema et al., 1997), but in some cases the effects
of predation were unclear or FIB-dependent (Korajkic et al., 2019,
2014). When molecular-based methods were used, they were typically
associated with slower decay (Gutiérrez-Cacciabue et al., 2016; Irank­
hah et al., 2016; Korajkic et al., 2014; Tiwari et al., 2019; Walters et al.,
2009), but Korajkic et al. (2019) only found this to be the case in
freshwater matrices. Turbidity was a significant water quality parameter
affecting decay (Ahmed et al., 2019; Gutiérrez-Cacciabue et al., 2016)
and more generally, the presence of vegetation or algae in the water was
also associated with greater persistence (Badgley et al., 2010; Becking­
hausen et al., 2014; Imamura et al., 2011).

3.1.4. Other factors
Although the majority of the studies identified focused on water
type, sunlight or predation as the influencing factors, a few of the studies
assessed site-specific FIB decay (Irankhah et al., 2016), or modified
variables such as temperature, mixing speeds, initial FIB loads, and
sediment or vegetation inclusion. Increasing temperatures were associ­
ated with increased decay of E. coli in chlorinated and untreated lake
water (Lund, 1996), fresh water (Terzieva and McFeters, 1991; Easton
et al., 2005; Nasser et al., 2003), brackish water and marine water
(Nasser et al., 2003). Mixing speed of fresh surface water samples did not
significantly affect the decay of indigenous microbiota (Bailey et al.,
2018), and the initial seed concentration of E. coli was shown to affect
decay rates in fresh and brackish water studies (Beckinghausen et al.,
2014; Gronewold et al., 2011). When comparing the decay of human
and bovine E. coli in freshwater microcosms, Liang et al. (2012)
concluded that human E. coli decayed faster than bovine. Zhang et al.
(2015) monitored the decay of FIB in seawater and beach sand micro­
cosms. Enterococci and C. perfringens decayed more slowly in beach sand
than water, but E. coli decayed similarly in water and sand matrices.
Mezrioui et al. (1995) looked at E. coli and S. typhimurium decay in
brackish water and sewage mixtures, mimicking slow or rapid marine
stress. Survival was greater when predators were removed in the fall and
summer experiments, but not in the winter experiments (Mezrioui et al.,
1995).
Four of the identified studies addressed the influence of vegetation or
natural aquatic plant life on the persistence of FIB. Submerged aquatic
vegetation indirectly facilitated the persistence of enterococci in fresh­
water microcosms (Badgley et al., 2010), algae presence in freshwater
microcosms led to greater persistence under UV conditions of E. coli and
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Beckinghausen et al., 2014)
and the presence of wrack was associated with increased levels of FIB in
water and sediments (Imamura et al., 2011). Tiwari et al. (2019)
compared decay of indicators and Vibrio spp. in a brackish beach mes­
ocosm with and without the presence of an aquatic plant, Myriophyllum
sibiricum. The molecular Enterococcus spp. markers decayed more slowly
than the culturable enterococci, and biphasic decay was observed for
both culturable and molecular targets in water.

3.2. Bacteria
Pathogenic bacteria were the next target type most commonly
studied in the identified literature. Twenty studies focused on the
persistence of bacteria, with targets such as pathogenic E. coli strains,
Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., Staphylo­
coccus spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica. Freshwater was the water type
studied most frequently (15/20) and the majority of the studies con­
ducted experiments in the dark (12/20). Varying predation status was
slightly more variable across the studies and the method type was the
least variable documented factor; 18 of the 20 identified studies quan­
tified the pathogenic bacteria concentrations with culture-based
methods.
3.2.1. Water type
The two studies that compared bacteria decay in different water
types observed some potential differences (Boehm et al., 2012; Levi­
n-Edens et al., 2011). Levin-Edens et al. (2011) evaluated the persistence
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in sterilized marine and
freshwater and both temperature and salinity were found to significantly
influence decay. Decay rates were higher at the higher temperature and
in freshwater. Boehm et al. (2012) addressed the inactivation of Sal­
monella serovars in filter-sterilized fresh and marine water matrices,
with sunlight as a stressor. Exponential decay was observed for the
serovars studied in seawater under light conditions, but little to no decay
was observed for the serovars studied in seawater under dark conditions.
A similar effect from sunlight was observed in freshwater, however, the
freshwater experiments exposed to sunlight exhibited a clear shoulder
effect not observed in the marine water. The shoulder period was only
1–1.5 h in length, and the observed T90s were less than 1 day in length,
indicating that the potential sunlight-water type interaction may not
greatly impact decay observations (Boehm et al., 2012).

3.1.5. Summary
In summary, some studies noted differential decay of FIB based on
water type: greater decay of FIB was observed in marine waters for fecal
coliforms, streptococci, and E. coli (Fujioka, 1981; Korajkic et al., 2013,
2019; Liang et al., 2017; Jeanneau et al., 2012). The literature also
suggests the possibility of interactions between water type and sunlight
presence and water type and method; one study found that the effects of
sunlight were more prevalent in higher salinity waters (Bordalo et al.,
2002) and another identified differences in decay rates between mo­
lecular and culture-based targets only in freshwater matrices (Korajkic

3.2.2. Sunlight
Beckinghausen et al. (2014) also observed rapid decay for

Salmonella. S. typhimurium had T90 values of 1 day or less in freshwater
microcosms exposed to natural sunlight regardless of initial seed con­
centration, and results indicated that the pathogen persists longer than
the studied indicator. As highlighted in Section 3.1.4, the presence of
algae in the microcosm, the main factor studied by Beckinghausen et al.
(2014), led to greater persistence for both E. coli and S. typhimurium. The
T90s for S. typhimurium in raw estuarine water maintained in the dark at
20 and 30 ◦ C were less than 2 days and less than 1 day, respectively
(Chandran and Mohamed Hatha, 2005). The presence of biological
factors (raw water) was deemed an important influence on persistence,
however sunlight caused the greatest inactivation in the experiments
overall (Chandran and Mohamed Hatha, 2005).
Rodríguez and Araujo (2012) specifically looked at Campylobacter
persistence in river water microcosms in situ and in the laboratory.
Temperature and sunlight were found to significantly affect decay in the
in-situ experiments, but pH, oxygen concentration and water conduc­
tivity did not. Silvester et al. (2021) explored the survival kinetics of five
Vibrio species in a study that looked at the effect of biotic factors, pro­
tozoan grazing, temperature, salinity, sunlight, and chemical composi­
tion in estuarine water. The researchers observed better survival in
sediment versus water, and the biological factors, chemical composition,
and sunlight increased the removal of the Vibrio species.

affecting decay in Ahmed et al. (2021) in the context of this review
suggests a potential interaction between predation and the method of
detection (culture vs. molecular-based) for pathogenic bacteria.
3.2.4. Other factors
Ibrahim et al. (2019) studied E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium,
human adenovirus serotype 2, and murine norovirus 1 survival while
stored in sterilized river water microcosms stored at -20◦ , 4◦ , 24 ◦ C and
37 ◦ C in the dark. The highest T90 values for the bacterial pathogens
were observed in the 4 ◦ C trials. Higher temperatures were associated
with faster decay of Listeria monocytogenes in river water sampled near
the outfall of a meat industry plant (Budzińska et al., 2012), E. coli O157:
H7 in sampled creek water (Easton et al., 2005), and E. coli, C. jejuni, and
Y. enterocolitica in sampled stream water (Terzieva and McFeters, 1991).
C. jejuni, however, was less affected by temperature, and Y. enterocolitica
had the greatest survival at both temperatures (Terzieva and McFeters,
1991).
Some of the identified studies addressed the persistence of a bacterial
target without manipulating any water or environmental factor directly,
and others studied alternative water quality factors- changing salinities,
aquatic plant presence or turbidity. El Mejri et al. (2012) studied the
survival of environmental and laboratory-adapted strains of Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium in marine water and the authors calcu­
lated an average T90 of 25–30 h for all the strains. Notably, total cell
count data suggested the bacteria were entering a viable but not cul­
turable state (El Mejri et al., 2012). In brackish beach mesocosms, Vibrio
spp. genetic markers exhibited biphasic decay, and there were positive
correlations between the culturable Enterococcus targets and V. cholerae
molecular targets only for the first few days of the experiment, sug­
gesting a limitation in current monitoring practices (Tiwari et al., 2019).
Except for Vibrio rRNA, the decay of the bacterial targets was greater in
water than sediment and vegetation (Tiwari et al., 2019).
Turbidity-related factors were significant in a study conducted by
Czajkowska et al. (2005). E. coli serotype O157:H7 was inoculated into
freshwater sampled from several different Polish lakes and rivers and
maintained at 4 or 24 ◦ C. The researchers conducted experiments using
water, “muddy” water, and bottom shore sediments. The bacteria sur­
vived slightly longer in muddy water experiments, and the survival
times were shorter for the experiments maintained at 24 ◦ C. The authors
did not detect a significant effect from the varying chemical oxygen
demand or pH levels (Czajkowska et al., 2005).

3.2.3. Predation
Avery et al. (2008) evaluated E. coli O157:H7 persistence in a variety
of water sources including lake and river waters. Sampled waters were
autoclaved or non-autoclaved, inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, and kept
at 10 ◦ C. The authors concluded that sterilization was significantly
correlated with decay (Avery et al., 2008). Topalcengiz and Danyluk
(2019) examined the fate of generic and pathogenic E. coli in agricul­
tural surface water microcosms and the bacteria decreased most rapidly
in non-sterile waters. Wang and Doyle (1998) sampled water from a
filtered and autoclaved municipal source, a reservoir and two recrea­
tional lakes, inoculated E. coli O157:H7, and monitored decay at 8, 15
and 25 ◦ C in the dark. For all water types, survival was greatest at 8 ◦ C
and the greatest survival was observed in the filtered and autoclaved
municipal water (Wang and Doyle, 1998).
The effects of predation on other pathogens, such as S. paratyphi and
V. parahaemolyticus, were observed in a study by Chandran et al. (2011).
The T90s for the pathogens were more rapid in the nonsterile waters,
illustrating the effect of predation or other biological factors (Chandran
et al., 2011). Silvester et al. (2021) also observed higher mortality rates
of Vibrio spp. in raw sediments and waters compared to autoclaved
sediments and waters. The experiments conducted by Lund et al. (1996)
used untreated and autoclaved lake water that was kept at 4 ◦ C or 10 ◦ C
in the dark. Survival was better at 4 ◦ C, and Y. enterolitica survived better
at lower temperatures than C. jejuni. Y. enterolitica also survived much
longer in autoclaved water than untreated water. There was possibly
some seasonal variation in the effects of predation as observed by
Mezrioui et al. (1995), as the survival of S. typhimurium was greater
when predation was absent in the fall and summer experiments, not in
the winter.
Predation did not play a key role in the only study identified in this
review that used molecular-based methods to quantify bacteria persis­
tence. In addition to FIB and MST markers, Ahmed et al. (2021) explored
Campylobacter spp. persistence with freshwater mesocosms exposed to
artificial sunlight conditions. Campylobacter spp. decayed linearly, at
faster rates at 25 ◦ C than at 15 ◦ C; and at similar rates between filtered
and nonfiltered experiments, suggesting predation did not significantly
impact decay. As noted in the FIB section, although the water was
filtered for the predation ‘absent’ experiments, the sewage inoculum still
had the potential to introduce predators, potentially masking the effect
of predation in this study. Although it is hard to make any inferences
given the limited number of studies, the use of the sewage inoculum, and
the different targets between the studies (Campylobacter spp. vs E. coli, S.
paratyphi, Vibrio spp. and Y. enterolitica), predation not significantly

3.2.5. Summary
Looking at the selected literature as a whole for pathogenic bacteria,
some expected relationships were consistently observed. In general,
decay is higher at higher temperatures as expected (Levin-Edens et al.,
2011; Rodríguez and Araujo, 2012; Wang and Doyle, 1998; Budzińska
et al., 2012; Ahmed et al., 2021; Lund et al., 1996; Czajkowska et al.,
2005; Terzieva and McFeters, 1991; Easton et al., 2005). The presence of
a light source consistently accelerates decay (Beckinhausen et al., 2014;
Chandran and Mohamed Hatha, 2005; Rodríguez and Araujo, 2012;
Silvester et al., 2021), however one study identified some potential
differences between the effect of sunlight in fresh and marine waters
(Boehm et al., 2012). Predation was found to significantly increase
decay in a variety of targets including pathogenic E. coli strains, Sal­
monella spp., Vibrio spp., and Y. enterolitica (Avery et al., 2008; Chan­
dran et al., 2011; Lund et al., 1996; Silvester et al., 2021; Topalcengiz
and Danyluk, 2019; Wang and Doyle, 1998). The effects of predation
were less obvious in a study by Mezriouia et al. (1995) in which
S. typhimurium survival was only greater in sterile waters during autumn
and summer seasons, and predation was not found to influence the
decay of Campylobacter spp. at all in a freshwater mesocosm study
(Ahmed et al., 2021). Although it was evaluated directly (and indirectly)
less in the pathogenic bacteria literature than the FIB literature,
turbidity seems to again be a factor potentially influencing decay
(Czajkowska et al., 2005). Other water quality factors such as pH,
6

dissolved oxygen, and water conductivity, were not found to signifi­
cantly affect the inactivation of pathogenic bacterial targets (Rodríguez
and Araujo, 2012; Czajkowska et al., 2005).

interactions as a whole, however, as it was an exception in a study
conducted by Yang and Griffiths (2013) using river water experiments.
The study manipulated temperatures, pH values, and some samples were
autoclaved and filtered. Except for QB, all the other F+RNA phages
persisted for longer in the heat-treated water (predation absent) and
were less stable when suspended solids were removed. The researchers
concluded that temperature and pH were major factors that affected the
phage survival (Yang and Griffiths, 2013). Tiwari et al. (2019) detected
MS2 with culture-based methods in their study of decay patterns in
brackish beach mesocosms. MS2 decayed log-linearly and had higher
decay in the mesocosms without vegetation. MS2 counts was strongly
correlated with culturable enterococci for the first 6–8 days (Tiwari
et al., 2019).

3.3. Bacteriophages
Nine of the studies identified in the literature review assessed the
persistence of bacteriophages in surface water matrices. Six of the
studies used freshwater, marine water was studied in three studies, and
one study used brackish water. Sunlight was absent from most of the
experiments, and predation was predominantly present. All nine studies
used culture-based methods to quantify the bacteriophage concentra­
tions over time.
Booncharoen et al. (2018) evaluated the persistence of human
sewage-specific enterococcal bacteriophage persistence from the Myo­
viridae (A2), Podoviridae (S1) and Siphoviridae (A1, S4) families in highly
and lowly populated fresh and marine water sources in Thailand. The
highest decay rates of A1, A2, and S4 were in the highly polluted
seawater matrix; the highest decay rate of S1 was in the highly polluted
freshwater matrix. All bacteriophages exhibited slower decay in filtered
samples and in lower pollution waters, suggesting predation does play
an important role in bacteriophage persistence. Additional experiments
at 5 ◦ C indicated that temperature significantly affects bacteriophage
decay. The effects of salinity on decay varied with the pollution level of
the water (Boonchareon et al., 2018). Marine water was tested in an
additional study in which the marine bacteriophage H6 was inoculated
into unfiltered marine water and maintained at 22 ◦ C (Olive et al.,
2020). Minimal decay was observed over the 16-day experiments, sug­
gesting that the existence of predators in the water affected the bacte­
riophage decay minimally (Olive et al., 2020).
Somatic coliphages from the Myroviridae and Siphoviridae family
were also evaluated in another study identified in this review (Lee and
Sobsey, 2011). Lee and Sobsey (2011) conducted experiments using
reagent water and natural surface waters sampled from a freshwater
body. Experiments were conducted at 4 ◦ C and 25 ◦ C. The analysis
suggested that water type (reagent vs fresh), temperature, and incuba­
tion time were strong predictors of inactivation. For most of the co­
liphages, decay was slower at 4 ◦ C (Lee and Sobsey, 2011). Greaves
et al. (2020) included a somatic coliphage in their large-scale freshwater
mesocosm experiments. The mesocosms were either exposed to sunlight
or left covered, and somatic coliphage was detectable for two days in the
uncovered experiments and five days in the covered experiments, indi­
cating that sunlight significantly affects decay. Notably, the viral in­
dicators in this study were more resistant to UV inactivation than the
bacterial indicators studied (Greaves et al., 2020).
Long and Sobsey (2004) addressed the persistence of F+RNA and
F+DNA coliphages in freshwater microcosms. Water was sampled from
a surface drinking water source, spiked with an individual phage to a
target concentration, and maintained at 4 ◦ C or 20 ◦ C in the dark. The
authors noted tailing in the survival curves and for all coliphages, decay
was slower at the lower temperature. The differences between the
temperatures was statistically significant for the F+DNA coliphages and
the Group II and Group IV F+RNA coliphages (Long and Sobsey, 2004).
Ravva and Sarreal (2016) evaluated the persistence of F-specific RNA
coliphages in the presence and absence of bacterial host in fresh surface
waters. The experiments were kept in the dark and maintained at tem­
peratures that simulated summer (25 ◦ C) or winter (10 ◦ C) conditions.
The addition of the host resulted in greater phage persistence, with
phages in the absence of host disappearing relatively rapidly. Temper­
ature significantly affected persistence, as greater survival was observed
at 10 ◦ C as compared to 25 ◦ C, and there were significant differences
between environmental and prototype isolate survival. The chemical
composition of the waters did not appear to affect decay; although QB
was assayed in waters with higher suspended solids than the other
strains, it decayed similarly (Ravva and Sarreal, 2016).
QB may not be representative of coliphage-suspended solids

3.3.1. Summary
Overall, the studies identified in the literature provided limited
insight into the factors potentially affecting decay. Temperature was the
most frequently addressed factor, and it was consistently determined to
significantly affect bacteriophage decay (Boonchareon et al., 2018;
Greaves et al., 2020; Lee and Sobsey, 2011; Long and Sobsey, 2004;
Ravva et al., 2016; Yang and Griffiths, 2013). Sunlight was shown to
increase decay rates of bacteriophages (Noble et al., 2004), but bacte­
riophages may be more resistant to UV inactivation than FIB (Greaves
et al., 2020). Predation also impacts bacteriophage decay, although the
impact may be sub-type dependent (Boonchareon et al., 2018; Yang and
Griffiths, 2013), and this review did not select any studies that suggested
significant differences between bacteriophage decay rates in different
water types (Boonchareon et al., 2018). As only culture-based methods
were used in the described studies, no conclusions could be drawn about
method-related decay differences. However, as opposed to the conclu­
sions drawn in the FIB and Bacteria Other factors sections (3.1.4 and
3.2.4), the bacteriophage literature suggests that pH does significantly
affect decay (Yang and Griffiths, 2013).
3.4. Viruses
There were 10 studies identified in the literature review that studied
the persistence of viruses. Eight of the 10 studies used freshwater, five
used marine water and only one used brackish water. The presence or
absence of sunlight was fairly variable, with two studies exposing all
experiments to sunlight, four studies keeping all experiments in the
dark, and four studies manipulating the presence of sunlight. Predation
was predominantly present in the experiments assessing virus persis­
tence and the virus target group had the greatest variety of method type;
four of the ten studies used molecular-based methods.
Adenovirus was the virus-type most frequently studied in the iden­
tified literature. Liang et al. (2017) assessed the effects of salinity and
sunlight on adenovirus and found that increasing salinity was associated
with greater adenovirus persistence. Increasing sunlight intensity
increased adenovirus decay rates, and results suggested that the viral
targets in this study were more susceptible to sunlight than their bac­
terial counterparts. Regardless of salinity or sunlight, intact cells
decayed faster than total DNA (Liang et al., 2017).
Human adenovirus 40/41 was also studied in freshwater mesocosms
that manipulated predation status and temperatures (Ahmed et al.,
2021). In one set of the experiments, the decay rates were similar be­
tween predation treatments, with higher decay rates observed at 25 ◦ C
compared to 15 ◦ C. In the other set of experiments, the effects of the
increased temperature were only prominent in the filtered treatments
(Ahmed et al., 2021). The effect of temperature on virus persistence was
also evaluated in a study using dark, sterilized river water microcosms
stored at -20 ◦ C, 4 ◦ C, 24 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C (Ibrahim et al., 2019). Adenovirus
had the slowest decay in -20 ◦ C with a T90 of almost 200 days and the
fastest decay at 37 ◦ C with a T90 of 27 h. Norovirus was not affected by
increasing temperatures in the typical manner with the fastest decay
occurring in the 24 ◦ C trials and the slowest decay occurring in the 4 ◦ C

(Ibrahim et al., 2019).
Carratalà et al. (2013) evaluated the persistence of adenoviruses in a
range of water matrices, but the experiments conducted in seawater
were the only ones that met the natural surface water criteria for the
review. Human adenovirus type 2 was inoculated into the seawater re­
actors and dark conditions were tested at 7 ◦ C, 20 ◦ C and 37 ◦ C, and
experiments were conducted with UVB and UVA light sources (both
classified as sunlight present herein). For the dark experiments, no sig­
nificant inactivation was observed at 7 ◦ C or 20 ◦ C, but higher inacti­
vation was observed at 37 ◦ C. The authors concluded that biotic factors
may be more relevant to virus inactivation than indirect
photo-inactivation by UVA radiation, especially at higher temperatures
(Carratalà et al., 2013).
Olive et al. (2020) investigated the microbial control of echovirus 11,
adenovirus 2, and the bacteriophage H6 decay in different water types.
Echovirus 11 was incubated in sterilized and non-sterilized lake water
maintained at room temperature, and echovirus 11, adenovirus 2, and
the bacteriophage H6 were inoculated into the eukaryotic fraction iso­
lated from lake and ocean water. The eukaryotic fraction and bacteria
fraction waters discussed in this study were merely classified as “pre­
dation present” for this review. The authors concluded that the micro­
bial virus control was temperature dependent, with more obvious
reductions at 22 ◦ C as compared to 16 ◦ C, dependent on the virus (Olive
et al., 2020).
Bergstein et al. (1997) evaluated the persistence of poliovirus with in
situ experiments in a freshwater lake located at different depths with
variable light exposure, and during different seasons (winter/summer).
Very little poliovirus decay was observed during the winter experiments,
regardless of light presence. In the summer experiment, light exposure
resulted in a 1-log reduction within ~4 days, compared to minimal
observed decay in the dark. Nasser et al. (2003) assessed the persistence
of coxsackie A9 virus in fresh, marine, and brackish waters and virus
persistence was found to be temperature-dependent, with faster decay
observed at 30 ◦ C than 15 ◦ C. Die-off of coxsackie A9 virus at 15 ◦ C and
30 ◦ C was greatest in marine water (Nasser et al., 2003).
The survival of Rhesus rotavirus and human astrovirus was charac­
terized in both groundwater and contaminated surface water in a study
conducted by Espinosa et al. (2008). Only the surface water experiments
met the “natural” waters criteria outlined in section S1. Results indi­
cated that virus infectivity persisted longer in groundwater than surface
water, and that rotavirus persistence was more stable than astrovirus.
Good correlation between virus infectivity and genomic material
detection was noted (Espinosa et al., 2008). The decay of enteroviruses
using molecular-based methods was assessed in light and dark seawater
microcosms in a study conducted by Walters et al. (2009). The infectious
enterovirus remained detectable longer in the dark microcosms than the
light. No difference in genome decay rates was observed between the
two treatments, suggesting a potential method-sunlight interaction for
virus targets (Walters et al., 2009). de Oliveira et al. (2021) assessed the
viability of SARS-CoV-2 in filtered and nonfiltered river water experi­
ments kept at 4 ◦ C and 24 ◦ C. Nonfiltered and higher temperature river
water experiments were associated with faster decay (de Oliveira et al.,
2021).

of predation on adenovirus persistence were unclear (Ahmed et al.,
2021). Olive et al. (2020) concluded that the microbial control of virus
populations may be temperature-dependent, as the differences between
the predation status was less obvious at lower temperatures. The effects
of temperature seem to be relatively consistent with the rest of the
aforementioned targets, with the exception of norovirus. Most studies
found that decay increased with increasing temperatures (2021; Carra­
talà et al., 2013; Nasser et al., 2003; de Oliviera et al., 2021), however
norovirus in one study had the highest decay rate at the second highest
temperature (24 ◦ C) (Ibrahim et al., 2019).
3.5. Protozoa
Protozoa were the least frequently studied target in the literature
identified in this review. Only four studies assessed the persistence of
protozoa, and as such, there was minimal water quality and environ­
mental factor variation to facilitate comparisons.
Multiple water matrices (fresh, brackish, and marine) were used by
Nasser et al. (2003) to test the persistence of Cryptosporidium at two
different temperatures (15◦ C or 30◦ C). The persistence of Cryptospo­
ridium was not influenced by temperature in any of the water types. In
general, little to no decay was observed for Cryptosporidium across all
the experiments, and it was concluded that E. coli was not a suitable
indicator for Cryptosporidium. Robertson et al. (2006) studied Crypto­
sporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst persistence in a freshwater river. The
river water temperature throughout the experiment fluctuated from
1.1 ◦ C to 7.3 ◦ C. River water was also sampled for a control experiment
maintained in the refrigerator (4 ◦ C). Cryptosporidium oocysts were
detected as viable up until ~20 weeks, and Giardia cysts were detected
until about 1 month. Comparisons between control and river environ­
ments suggest that temperature changes, and other physical, chemical
and biological factors do not significantly impact the decay of the
studied parasites (Robertson et al., 2006).
Medema et al. (1997) evaluated the persistence of Cryptosporidium
parvum in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were
maintained in the dark. The effects of predation were evident at 15 ◦ C,
but not at 5 ◦ C. Die-off of C. parvum was faster at the higher temperature
(Medema et al., 1997). The freshwater mesocosms constructed by
Ahmed et al. (2021) also evaluated the persistence of C. parvum. C.
parvum genome decay was best described by a biphasic model, and a
greater reduction was observed at 25 ◦ C than 15 ◦ C for all trials. Vital
dye assays were used to assess C. parvum viability, and the relationship
with temperature and filtration status was found to be variable.
3.5.1. Summary
The four studies addressing protozoa persistence described herein
suggest that Cryptosporidium is relatively resistant to the factors that
have been shown to increase decay rates of the other target types as
expected. Two of the studies found no increase in decay rate with
increased temperatures, and decay was similar between the sunlight
present and absent studies conducted by Robertson et al. (2006). The
study conducted by Medema et al. (1997) suggests that C. parvum may
be affected by predation at some temperatures, again suggesting that
interactions between predation and temperature may be significantly
affecting the decay of pathogens in surface waters. However, the other
study assessing predation suggested there was minimal impact from
predation presence (Ahmed et al., 2021).

3.4.1. Summary
Overall, the results of the studies that manipulated water type sug­
gest that the decay of viruses may be faster in marine waters than in
fresh (Nasser et al., 2003), although Liang et al. (2017) observed greater
persistence with increasing salinities. In general, sunlight increased viral
decay (Carratalà et al., 2013; Bergstein et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2017),
but there was no difference between genome decay rates in a study
conducted by Walters et al. (2009). Similarly to the bacteriophage
literature, the studies identified herein suggest that the relationship
between virus persistence and predation may be complicated. de Oli­
veira et al. (2021) observed clear differences between SARS-CoV-2
persistence when predation was present versus absent, but the effects

4. Discussion
4.1. Observed decay kinetics
The majority of the studies identified in this review used first-order
kinetics to describe the observed decay. A number of the studies
described herein, however, observed biphasic decay patterns Ahmed
et al., 2019; Dick et al., 2010; Solecki et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015;

explored in analyses that expand past the assumption of first-order
decay kinetics. This review differed from some of the previous system­
atic literature reviews in that the studies had to include raw data that
met the requirements for model fitting (more than three time points), as
opposed to previous reviews that aimed to extract reported first-order
decay rates (Boehm et al., 2018, 2019). The 61 studies described here­
in represent over 600 experiments available in the literature for this
purpose.

Mattioli et al., 2017; Tiwari et al., 2019; Carratalà et al., 2013; de Oli­
viera et al., 2021; Easton et al., 2005; Medema et al., 1997). Some of
these studies noted biphasic decay but only fit log-linear models, while
others fit alternative model forms. Of the 61 studies included in this
review, less than 20% analyzed their data with biphasic or nonlinear
model forms in addition to the traditionally assumed first-order decay
kinetic profiles (Ahmed et al., 2019, 2021; Bailey et al., 2019; Carratalà
et al., 2013; de Oliviera et al., 2021; Jeanneau et al., 2012; Lee and
Sobsey, 2011; Mattioli et al., 2017; Solecki et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2015). The most frequently applied model form in these studies was the
so termed “biphasic decay model”, represented by Eqs. (1) and ((2),
where C(t) is the concentration at time t, C0 is the concentration at time
0, t’ is the time point where the second phase of decay begins, and k1 and
k2 are the first-order decay constants for the two phases (Zhang et al.,
2015; Ahmed et al., 2019, 2021). The biphasic decay model provided a
good fit to cultured FIB in marine water (Zhang et al., 2015), molecular
targets for FIB in fresh and marine water (Ahmed et al., 2019), and
C. parvum molecular targets in freshwater (Ahmed et al., 2021).

4.2. Environment and water quality factor interactions
In addition to quantifying the available data in the literature for
persistence modeling purposes, this review also aimed to assess the
current state of the knowledge regarding the water quality and envi­
ronmental factors that impact indicator and pathogen decay in surface
waters. Previous factor analyses have used dependent variables derived
from the assumed first-order decay kinetics (Boehm et al., 2018, 2019).
It is possible that the reduction in model uncertainty through the
application of more accurate persistence models will also facilitate
factor analyses capable of elucidating the finer relationships between
environment and water quality factors affecting target persistence.
Previous analyses that fit alternative persistence models to a large
database of experiments did not complete an adjoining factor analysis
(Mitchell and Akram, 2017).
The studies discussed herein analyzed the effect of water quality and
environmental variables with a variety of methods. Correlation co­
efficients and analyses (Ahmed et al., 2019; Tiwari et al., 2019; Korajkic
et al., 2014; Espinosa et al., 2008), two-way and three-way ANOVAs
(Korajkic et al., 2013, 2019; Wanjugi et al., 2016; Avery et al., 2008),
multiple linear regression (Liang et al., 2017; Levin-Edens et al., 2011),
and generalized linear mixed models (Wanjugi et al., 2016) were some
of the methods implemented.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the factors most frequently addressed by the
studies identified in this literature review were temperature, sunlight,
and predation. Temperature consistently was associated with decay for
FIB, pathogenic bacteria, bacteriophages, and viruses, but increasing
temperatures had little effect on protozoan decay in the identified
literature (Robertson et al., 2006; Nasser et al., 2003). The presence of
artificial or natural sunlight was frequently one of the main drivers of
inactivation for the studied target types (except for protozoa), however
FIB may be more susceptible to UV inactivation than viral indicators
(Greaves et al., 2020). The FIB and pathogenic bacteria literature sug­
gest that there may be possible interactions between sunlight and water
type (Boehm et al., 2012; Bordalo et al., 2002) as well as sunlight and
method of detection (culture vs. molecular-based) (Walters et al., 2009;
Korajkic et al., 2019). It is important to note however, that other factors
such as turbidity, UV wavelength, or water depth that were not consis­
tently documented may be impacting the interpretation of the effects of
sunlight presence on target persistence. The presence of predation
typically was found to increase decay for FIB, pathogenic bacteria, vi­
ruses, and bacteriophages, but the effects of predation were in some
cases unclear (Korajkic et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2021) and possible
water type-predation interactions for FIB (Korajkic et al., 2013) and
temperature-predation interactions for viral and protozoan targets were
observed (Olive et al., 2020; Medema et al., 1997).
Fewer studies identified in the literature addressed the effects of
water type and method of detection for the targets of concern. Decay
differed by water type for some FIB with increasing salinities generally
associated with faster decay (Fujioka, 1981; Korajkic et al., 2013; Liang
et al., 2017; Jeanneau et al., 2012). Marine water was also associated
with faster decay of viral targets in one study (Nasser et al., 2003), which
differs from conclusions in a previous review (Boehm et al., 2019). The
FIB literature also suggested potential water type-method of detection
interactions, as differences in FIB decay between culture-based and
molecular-based methods were identified in the freshwater experiments
but not the marine water (Korajkic et al., 2019). One study of pathogenic

Solecki et al. (2011) also observed biphasic decay in their FIB ex­
periments, however, the model applied to the data slightly differed from
Eqs. (1), (2). As shown in Eq. (3), the two first-order decay rates were
applied to different proportions of the initial population of C0, desig­
nated with the parameter, f. The observed biphasic decay was hypoth­
esized to be due to rapid die-off until a carrying capacity was reached, or
the microorganisms using quorum sensing to regulate their numbers
(Solecki et al., 2011). The same model was applied to the decay of FIB
(Jeanneau et al., 2012), somatic coliphages (Lee and Sobsey, 2011) and
adenovirus (Carratalà et al., 2013), albeit with f defined as a mixing
parameter (designated as ω) in the study of adenovirus inactivation.

Mattioli et al. (2017) fit the shoulder log-linear model to FIB
persistence experiments and found that the shoulder log-linear model
provided the best fit to enterococci molecular data. Instead of a second
decay rate, as is the case for Eqs. (1)–(3), the shoulder log-linear model’s
second parameter, S, represents the shoulder or lag time where there is
minimal inactivation (Eq. (4)). The other studies that applied nonlinear
model forms, such as the exponential biphasic, Weibull, and Gompertz
models, found that the nonlinear models provided better fits to virus
inactivation data under all tested conditions (de Oliviera et al. 2021),
and bacteriophage inactivation data from the experiments evaluating
the effect of their highest tested temperature (25 ◦ C vs 4 ◦ C) (Lee and
Sobsey, 2011).

Of the few studies discussed herein that analyzed the fit of both
nonlinear and linear models to persistence data, the nonlinear models
were found to provide a good fit to FIB, bacteriophage, virus, and pro­
tozoa data from experiments representing different water types, tem­
peratures, and methods of detection. Biphasic decay has also been
described in other persistence studies regarding matrices with condi­
tions that did not meet the requirements of the review herein (Easton
et al., 2005; Park et al., 2016). These studies and the results of previous
modeling studies (Mitchell and Akram, 2017; Dean et al., 2020) suggest
that two or three-parameter models are better able to capture the dy­
namics of decay than the traditionally assumed first-order kinetics. One
of the aims of this review was to determine the quantity of available
pathogen and indicator persistence data for surface waters that could be

the relationships between factor and decay. Future experiments can be
designed to test these potential interactions more thoroughly, and this
review provides the foundation for the intentional inclusion of interac­
tion terms in factor analyses, as opposed to exploratory analyses with
forward or backwards selection, which is needed in the experimental
design phase for such work. The methods frequently used to study
persistence in surface waters (microcosms, mesocosms), models used to
describe decay, and the techniques used to study factor relationships
(correlation analyses, ANOVAs, regressions) were reviewed herein to aid
future researchers in the endeavor to better understand pathogen threats
and human health risks in surface waters.

bacteria suggested decay may be faster in freshwater than marine
(Levin-Edens et al., 2011), and the studies identified in this review did
not have enough data to draw any conclusions about the effects of water
type on bacteriophage or protozoan decay. Turbidity was found to in­
fluence decay in the FIB and pathogenic bacteria literature, and pH was
a potential factor of significance in the bacteriophage literature.
Notably, the majority of the studies focused on FIB and pathogenic
bacteria and the factors affecting their persistence. Additional research
manipulating water quality factors as they influence virus, bacterio­
phage, and protozoa decay are needed to better understand those re­
lationships. The majority (75%) of the identified studies addressed
persistence in freshwater matrices, and only 38% and 13% addressed
persistence in marine and brackish matrices, respectively. In general,
there was a lack of data for molecular-based methods. The lack of data
on water type comparisons and persistence measured with molecularbased methods were research gaps noted in a previous review
(Boehm et al., 2018). It is important to note, however, that the quali­
tative synthesis of the studies discussed in this review reflect the water
quality and environmental conditions assessed in experiments shared in
the peer-reviewed literature that also documented target concentrations
for more than three independent time points.

5. Conclusions

Supplementary materials

This systematic review identified 61 studies that addressed the
persistence of indicators or pathogens in natural surface water matrices,
and these studies represent over 600 experiments in the literature that
provided quantitative data to further explore persistence models that
challenge traditional first-order decay kinetic assumptions. Strong re­
lationships between sunlight, predation, temperature and persistence
were consistently discussed for the majority of the target types. The
effects of water type, method of detection, turbidity and pH were less
consistent across target types and should be further explored in future
analyses. This review highlighted several potential interactions between
the water quality and experimental factors that could further complicate
