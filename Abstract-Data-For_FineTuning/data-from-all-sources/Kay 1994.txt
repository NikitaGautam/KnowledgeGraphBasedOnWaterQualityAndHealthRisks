Predicting likelihood of gastroenteritis from

sea

bathing:

from randomised exposure

Summary

Introduction

The health effects of bathing in coastal waters is an area of
scientific controversy. We conducted the first ever
randomised "trial" of an environmental exposure to
measure the health effects of this activity. The trial was
spread over four summers in four UK resorts and 1216
adults took part. Detailed interviews were used to collect
data on potential confounding factors and intensive water
quality monitoring was used to provide more precise
indices of exposure. 548
people were randomised to
bathing, and the exposure included total immersion of the
head. Crude rates of gastroenteritis were significantly
higher in the exposed group (14&middot;8 per 100) than the

There is a widespread belief that sea bathing may lead to
illnessâ€™ but evidence for such an association has proved
elusive. No consistent relation between any single
microbiological indicator of water quality and disease has
emerged2,3 from the many studies that have been
undertaken.4-15 Despite this, microbiological standards
and recommendations have been drawn up for bathing
waters in Europe and North America.16-21

who did not selected themselves and may have differed in

water to which they were exposed, (2) the microbiological
quality of water was not assigned to each bather at the
time and place of bathing, and (3) non-water-related risk
factors were not measured or adequately controlled for.
To overcome these problems, and following a suggestion
of the World Health Organization (WHO),22 we have
conducted a randomised controlled exposure study.
Groups of healthy adults were allocated at random to
bathe or not to bathe at UK resorts that met the
mandatory EC standards. The levels of indicator
organisms to which each bather was exposed were
precisely determined. Four such studies were done, and
preliminary results, based on the first two, have been
published.23,24 In this paper we present the dose-response
relation between gastroenteritis and exposure to sea water

four year programme.

mind.

Four sites around the UK coast that had met EC mandatory
bacteriological criteria for bathing waters18 in the previous
summer were selected by an independent committee. Adult
volunteers (>18 years) were recruited in population centres close
to the study sites in the 3 weeks before the study. Background
rates in previous studies gave our study the power to detect an
increase in illness rate of 5% above background at alpha=0&middot;01
and beta=0&middot;02. The acceptable water quality and minimum age
of volunteers were both requirements defined in ethical clearance
for the studies granted by the Royal College of Physicians
Committee for Research on Healthy Volunteers. The studies
took place at four separate locations on four successive bathing
seasons between 1989-1992 (beaches A-D)
Volunteers attended for an extensive structured personal
enrolment interview and medical examination not more than 2
days before the exposure day. The interview recorded age, sex,
occupation, household size, general health, illness in previous 3
weeks, water contact activities, and other possible confounding
factors associated with gastroenteritis. Those deemed unfit at the

examination (eg, serious heart conditions, lifethreatening illness, fear of water; n=16) and those who failed to
attend on the trial day (n=183) were excluded from further
analysis. 23 volunteers who failed to comply with their
randomisation status were also excluded because no water
quality data were available for "non-bathers" who bathed and the
research team could not confirm that "bathers" who claimed to
have stayed on the beach had not entered the water unobserved.
The remaining 1306 volunteers (table 2) were randomised into
bathing and non-bathing groups using a computerised table of
random numbers on the exposure day. Some recruitment was
also undertaken on the trial day itself. Participants recruited on
the trial day were given the initial trial day interviews, examined
by a physician, and randomised to bather or non-bather.
Volunteers were unaware of their group status until they reported
to the beach. The bathing group (exposed) entered a defined and
roped-off 20 m area of water for at least 10 min, completely
immersing their heads at least three times. Their location and
duration of exposure was closely monitored. The non-bathing
(unexposed) group remained in a designated area on the adjacent
beach. Before they left the beach, participants were interviewed
about their current health and dietary habits for the days before
the trial day.
Further extensive interviews inquiring about health, diet, water
contact activity, and other possible non-water-related risk factors
for gastroenteritis in the intervening period were done 1 week
after the trial day. Volunteers were also given medical
examinations. Interviewers were blind to exposure status. 3
weeks subsequent to the trial date participants each received a
final questionnaire by post on which to record any further
symptoms of illness and exposure to bathing water. These delay
periods were chosen to accommodate the incubation periods of
illness often attributed to bathing exposures such as viral
gastroenteritis and cryptosporidiosis. The study was not designed
to pick up longer incubation illness such as hepatitis A.

Analytical
The success of randomisation was assessed by comparing the
distribution of non-water-related risk factors for gastroenteritis
among bathers and non-bathers (table 1). This was done by
univariate X2 analysis. If randomisation was successful, the crude
rates of illness for bathers and non-bathers would be adjusted for
any of those extraneous risk factors. If randomisation was not
successful for any non-water-related risk factor, the effect of this
failure was assessed, for any association between illness at
increasing indicator organism exposure, by multiple logistic

regression.
The indicator organism concentrations to which individual
bathers were exposed were assigned from results obtained from
samples at three depths taken at the location of, and during, the
exposure to sea water. Where this was not possible the closest
sample results of the time of the individual exiting the water were
assigned as the measure of exposure. All volunteers (and
interviewers) were "blind" to the water quality attributed to each
bather.
Statistical analyses examined dose-response relationships
between exposure (as measured by microbiological water quality)
and gastroenteritis, whilst controlling for the effects of
confounding factors. Confounding factors included nonexposure-related variables likely to affect the incidence of
gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis was defined as any case of
vomiting or diarrhoea plus any case of either indigestion or
nausea accompanied by fever reported at either post-exposure
interview. Participants were excluded from the analysis where
they failed to attend for follow-up interviews or where precise
details of the indicator organism density to which the bathers
were exposed could not be determined.
Trends in gastroenteritis rate with indicator organism exposure
measured at the three depths were examined by the MantelHaenszel X2 test for linear trend .21 Exposure classes for total and
faecal coliforms were defined, on the basis of existing standards,
as 0-2400 and greater than 2400 total coliforms per 100 mL
(dL) and 0-200 and greater than 200 faecal coliforms/dL and
0-34, 35-69, and greater than 70 faecal streptococci/dL. Rates of
gastroenteritis amongst the unexposed were thus compared with
rates amongst those exposed to water quality judged to comply
with or to exceed current standards for total coliforms, faecal
coliform, and faecal streptococci.
Since no quantitative standards exist for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and total staphylococci, median values were used to
define exposure, the classes being 0 and greater than 0
P aeruginosaldL and 0-172 and greater than 172 total
staphylococci/dL. Trend analyses were repeated excluding the
unexposed group. A trend was considered significant if the



Mantel Haenszel XI for linear trend yielded a p value less than
0-05 with and without the inclusion of the unexposed group.
This ensured that the trend statistic was not unduly influenced
by an excessive difference between the gastroenteritis rate in the
unexposed group and that in the lowest exposure class."â€™2
Trends were also assessed by study site and the differences in
stratum-specific gastroenteritis rates between sites examined to
justify combining the data.
Any significant trends were further analysed by quartiles and
20-unit intervals to define exposure categories. Multiple logistic
regression analysis was then used to examine the details of
significant dose relationships between indicator organism
concentration and gastroenteritis whilst controlling for significant
non-exposure-related risk, or confounding, factors found by
univariate xZ analyses between the exposed and reference groups.
Two independent analyses were conducted with the BMDP" (by
JMF) and MULTLR34 (by RLS) statistical packages. This
provided an independent validation of the results of the BDMP
models which are reported herein and were constructed with
backwards selection procedures to control for confounding
factors.

Results
Table 2 shows numbers of volunteers who came to the
beach on the four trial days, the exclusions due to missing
indicator organism data or incomplete follow-up, the final
cohorts, and the percentages with complete follow-up
information. The median ages of the volunteers before
exclusions were bathers 31-8 years and non-bathers 32-4
years. After exclusions the medians were 31-7 years and
32-1, respectively. The sex balance was 47-4%
males/52-6% females before exclusions and 45-6%/54-4%
afterwards.
Each trial covered a 3 h period. Significant spatial and
temporal variability was observed in indicator organism
concentrations at each site throughout the 3 h period of
sea water sampling during which bathers were exposed.
Crude rates of gastroenteritis were significantly higher
in the exposed group (14-8%) than in the unexposed
group (9-7%) (p=001). A check on non-water-related
risk factors showed randomisation to have been successful
in that no confounding was observed between non-waterrelated factors and the excess risk for bathers at increasing
levels of indicator organism exposure.
34-3% of gastroenteritis cases developed within 7 days
of the study day, the remaining 65-7% had onset dates up
to 21 days. No difference in onset of symptoms was
observed between the exposed and unexposed groups. Of
the five indicator organisms analysed, only increases in
faecal streptococci concentrations derived from samples
taken at chest depth were associated with a trend towards
increased rates of gastroenteritis when the unexposed
(non-bather) group was included or excluded in the trend
analysis (table 3). The exposure categories were then
defined by the quartile points of the faecal streptococci
distribution. This was done to remove any possible

group

(table 4).

Better to delineate the faecal streptococci exposure at
which bathers reported gastroenteritis significantly more
than non-bathers, the data were split into 20 unit intervals
of faecal streptococci exposure (table 5). The increased
risk to the bathers did not start until exposure to 40 or
more faecal streptococci/dL.
Trends in gastroenteritis rate with increasing faecal
streptococci exposure were not significantly different
between sites, indicating that the pooling of data from all
four studies was justified. Furthermore, all volunteers at
all sites were healthy adults who underwent medical
examination and screening before exposure.
Logistic regression analysis (BMDP model) revealed no
confounding of the relation between exposure to faecal
streptococci and illness by the risk factors shown (table
6). Nor was there any significant interaction between
faecal streptococci exposure and any of these non-waterrelated risk factors. Results with the MULTR model were
similar. The lack of interaction between faecal
streptococci exposure and the non-water-related risk
factors shows that the non-water factors are independent
predictors of illness.
The analyses presented thus far suggest that the risk of
gastroenteritis does not increase until bathers are exposed
to about 40 faecal streptococci/dL. To define the
threshold more precisely, we did logistic regression

Discussion
This is the first time that the methods of a randomised
controlled clinical trial have been applied to an
environmental exposure. The relation between faecal
streptococci concentration measured at chest depth and
gastroenteritis is robust. No other microbiological
indicator at any sampling depth displayed a significant
trend relating concentration to gastroenteritis rate. The
biological basis of this observation is unknown and there
is no suggestion that faecal streptococci was the
aetiological agent involved. However, it would be logical
to presume that whatever causes gastroenteritis copartitions in sea water with faecal streptococci. A
Norwalk-like virus is one possibility. The case definition
of gastroenteritis used gave relative prominence to
upper gastrointestinal

Model is adjusted for following significant non-exposure related risk
factors identified between bathers reporting gastroenteritis and those
not reporting gastroenteritis post exposure:
(a) Predisposition to diarrhoea (diarrhoea at least once per month vs
less than twice per year) (site A). (b) Diarrhoea lasting over 24 h within
3 weeks before exposure (all sites). (c) Usual fatigue lasting over 23 h
within 3 weeks before exposure (site B). (d) Gastroenteritis in family
members preceding illness experienced by individual bathers (all sites)
(e) Gender (all sites). (f) Age (10 unit categories) (all sites).
(g) Hamburgers or take-out food consumed within 3 days before and 7
days post exposure (site B). (h) Purchased sandwiches consumed
within 3 days before and 7 days post exposure (site A).
From equaton (see Results) a value of 32 per 100 mL on x axis for
faecal streptococcal density is the approximate density at which
predicted probability of gastroenteritis equals observed proportion of
non-bathers reporting gastroenteritis (ie, y, the excess, is zero).

outcome variable with faecal streptococci density as a
continuous variable. Since all previous models had
indicated no excess risk among bathers exposed to 20-39
faecal streptococci/dL, the median faecal streptococci
density to which bathers were exposed within this
exposure grouping was chosen as the cut-point on which
to conduct separate logistic regression analysis-ie,
separate logistic models were computed for bathers
exposed to less than 32 and more than 32 faecal
streptococci/dL. Because the faecal streptococci density
was
a
continuous variable here, a square-root
transformation was necessary to ensure linearity.
The model for bathers exposed to less than 32 faecal
streptococci/dL was not significant (likelihood ratio
=0-67, p=041) but for bathers exposed to more than
32 faecal streptococci/dL there was a significant result
(6-33, p=002), as follows:

Logn

odds (of

then used to calculate the probability of
gastroenteritis symptoms with increased faecal
streptococci exposure (figure 1). The model predicts a
probability of illness of 0-0866 at 32 faecal
streptococci/dL and 0-1039 at 33/dL. When compared
with the observed rate of gastroenteritis symptoms among
non-bathers (0-0975) the model does provide strong
evidence that 33 faecal streptococci/100 mL is the
threshold of increased risk.

Our findings are not applicable to younger bathers or
special interest groups such as surfers, sailboarders, and
divers; nor can they be extrapolated to freshwater
recreation sites. They do show that existing EC
standards" have very little public health significance to
coastal bathing waters in temperate north-west Europe.
Indeed coliforms seem to have little value as indicators of
the risks of gastroenteritis from sewage pollution of
coastal waters. Faecal streptococci concentrations are a
better microbiological indicator of whether sea water is fit
for bathing in and should replace coliform concentrations
as the basis for official standards. Some movement in this
direction is evident in proposed amendments to EC
bathing water standards.21 Information on faecal
streptococci concentrations, resort-by-resort and day-byday, may have an important role in helping people decide
whether to bathe or not
