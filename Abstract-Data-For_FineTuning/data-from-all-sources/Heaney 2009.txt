Recent studies of beach sand fecal contamination have triggered interest among scientists and in the media.
Although evidence shows that beach sand can harbor high concentrations of fecal indicator organisms, as well as
fecal pathogens, illness risk associated with beach sand contact is not well understood. Beach visitors at 7 US
beaches were enrolled in the National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational Water
(NEEAR) Study during 2003–2005 and 2007 and asked about sand contact on the day of their visit to the beach
(digging in the sand, body buried in the sand). Then, 10–12 days after their visit, participants were telephoned to
answer questions about any health symptoms experienced since the visit. The authors completed 27,365 interviews. Digging in the sand was positively associated with gastrointestinal illness (adjusted incidence proportion
ratio (aIPR) ¼ 1.13, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.25) and diarrhea (aIPR ¼ 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.36). The
association was stronger between those buried in the sand and gastrointestinal illness (aIPR ¼ 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05,
1.43) and diarrhea (aIPR ¼ 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.52). Nonenteric illnesses did not show a consistent association
with sand contact activities. Sand contact activities were associated with enteric illness at beach sites. Variation in
beach-speciﬁc results suggests that site-speciﬁc factors may be important in the risk of illness following sand
exposure.

Recent studies of fecal contamination of beach sand have
triggered interest among scientists, the media, and the general public regarding the safety of exposure to sand at the
beach (1–19). There exists evidence that beach sand can
harbor fecal indicator organisms (microbes whose presence
indicates the potential presence of fecal pathogens), as well
as pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi); viruses
(adenovirus, norovirus, enterovirus, coxsackievirus types
A16, B1, and B5, echovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, hepatitis A virus); fungi (Candida albicans and dermatophytic
fungi); and parasitic nematodes (Toxocara canis) (6, 8, 10,
14, 20–25).

The sources of high levels of fecal microbial pollution in
beach sand are not clear. Some studies attributed the source of
fecal pollution to municipal sewage treatment plant discharges in close proximity to beaches (26, 27); however,
other studies attributed the source of fecal pollution to nonpoint sources, such as urban runoff and/or warm-blooded
domestic and wild animals (2, 5, 6, 28). Numerous studies
found that the conditions in foreshore, nearshore, and backshore sand can favor the persistence, survival, and regrowth
of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus, suggesting that elevated levels of these fecal indicator bacteria in beach sand
may represent autochthonous populations rather than impacts
from sewage sources of contamination (2, 6, 8, 10, 16, 29).
Conditions that favor the persistence, survival, and possible

Contact With Beach Sand and Risk of Illness

regrowth of autochthonous fecal indicator bacteria in sand
include increased protection from sunlight, buffered temperatures, more nutrient availability, reduced osmotic stress,
cover from predation by other microorganisms, a large surface area for biofilm development, and higher moisture and
organic content from wave swash (2, 6, 8, 10, 14, 29, 30).
Despite the presence of fecal indicator organisms and
pathogens in the sand, a consistent relation with health effects
has not been demonstrated (16, 31). Little is known about the
relation between specific sand contact activities and health
effects, and few studies have examined whether specific
beach sand contact activities are associated with an increased
risk of illness among beachgoers (16, 31). Using data gathered from beachgoers participating in the 2003–2005 and
2007 trials of the National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational Water (NEEAR) Study (32,
33), we examined the relation between reported beach sand
contact and the risk of enteric and nonenteric illnesses at
beaches with a nearby sewage treatment plant outfall.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design/participant sampling

The NEEAR Study evaluated microbial water quality and
followed cohorts of visitors to freshwater and marine
beaches. The data collection methods have been described
previously (32, 33). In brief, we interviewed beachgoers as
they arrived and as they were leaving the beach about their
contact with beach sand, swimming behaviors, and other
beach activities; 10–12 days later, one of the adults in the
household was interviewed by telephone about symptoms
experienced by participating household members. Because
of the acute nature and short duration of the illnesses and
infections considered during this study, participants could
reenroll in the study 28 days after their previous enrollment.
Beach descriptions

Seven beaches with nearby sewage treatment plant discharges were chosen for the NEEAR studies (32, 33). In
2003, NEEAR studies were conducted at West Beach (on
Lake Michigan in Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in
Porter, Indiana) and Huntington Beach (on Lake Erie in
Bay Village, Ohio). In 2004, 2 Lake Michigan beaches were
studied: Silver Beach in St. Joseph, Michigan, and Washington Park Beach in Michigan City, Indiana. In 2005, a marine water beach was studied: Edgewater Beach, on the Gulf
of Mexico near Biloxi, Mississippi. In 2007, we studied 2
additional marine water beaches: Fairhope Beach, on Mobile Bay in Fairhope, Alabama, and Goddard Beach, on
Greenwich Bay near Warwick, Rhode Island. All beaches
participating in the Environmental Protection Agency’s
NEEAR Study had sewage treatment plant discharges
within 7 miles (11.2 km) of the beach location.
Deﬁnition of sand contact

As they were leaving the beach, participants reported
whether they had dug or been buried in the sand. Being
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:164–172

buried in the sand was considered as a potential indicator
of more intense sand exposure. In 2007, participants reported whether they got sand in their mouth, ate or drank
after playing in the sand, and washed their hands before
eating or drinking after playing in sand. In addition to sand
exposures on the day of enrollment, participants reported
other activities, such as whether they swam or ate raw meat,
runny eggs, or shellfish, in the 3 days prior to enrollment.
Health assessments

In a telephone interview 10–12 days following the day of
beach exposure, participants reported if they had experienced any of the following symptoms since their day of
enrollment.
1. ‘‘Gastrointestinal illness’’ was defined as any of the following: diarrhea (3 or more loose stools in a 24-hour
period); vomiting; nausea and stomach ache; and nausea
or stomach ache and interference with regular activities
(missed time from work or school or missed regular activities as a result of the illness).
2. ‘‘Upper respiratory illness’’ was defined as any 2 of the
following: sore throat, cough, runny nose, cold, or fever.
3. ‘‘Rash’’ was defined as a rash or itchy skin.
4. ‘‘Eye ailments’’ were defined as either eye infection or
watery eye.
5. ‘‘Earache’’ was defined as earache, ear infection, or
runny ears.
6. ‘‘Infected cut’’ was defined as a cut or wound that became infected.
During the telephone follow-up interview, we also asked
participants about activities since enrollment, including the
number of times attending the same beach, swimming at
another beach or pool, or eating raw or undercooked foods
(e.g., red meat, fish, shellfish, eggs). Participants with prevalent illness (symptoms within 3 days of the beach visit)
were excluded from the analysis for that outcome and were
eligible to be included in analyses of other outcomes. We
also examined a definition of gastrointestinal illness as diarrhea alone (3 loose stools in a 24-hour period).
Statistical analysis

Participants with complete data for exposure, outcome,
and critical covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, swimming
status, and beach) were included in analyses. We used loglinear binomial regression models to estimate the crude and
adjusted incidence proportion ratios and 95% confidence
intervals for each outcome and its association with each
beach sand contact activity. Observations that matched on
birth date and other distinctive characteristics were considered potential reenrollees of the same household. Robust
variance estimates were used to account for the nonindependence of observations within a household (34, 35).
We considered covariates strongly associated with beach
sand contact and illness or those regarded by investigators to
be potential confounding factors for inclusion in regression
models: age, sex, race/ethnicity, swimming, beach, contact

with animals, contact with other persons with diarrhea,
number of other visits to the beach, any other chronic
illnesses (gastrointestinal, skin, asthma), presence of beach
festivals, and eating any food or drink while at the beach.
For upper respiratory illness, rash, infected cuts, and eye
outcomes, use of insect repellent and sun block was also
considered. At a minimum, age, sex, and beach were included in all models (for the pooled analysis). If there was
a substantial difference between fully adjusted and reduced
model results, we used a backwards elimination approach.
For each analysis, the set of covariates was reduced through
a change-in-estimate procedure (36). Adjusted incidence

proportion ratio (full (aIPRfull) and reduced (aIPRreduced))
values were compared by using the formula: ln|aIPRfull/
aIPRreduced| 3 100. A criterion of a 5% change was used,
and results from fully adjusted models were used if the reduced model resulted in a change in estimate of greater than
5%. The selection procedure generally reduced the number
of covariates to 7 or less.
To model an observed age-sex crossover for the enteric
outcomes more precisely, we used multiplicative interaction
coding between the linear age regression spline and sex
variables in log-linear binomial regression models. Nonenteric illnesses showed a linear trend of decline in the

age-specific incidence proportions and no age-sex crossover. For the nonenteric illnesses (upper respiratory illness,
skin rash, eye ailments, earache, infected cuts), linear age
was used in regression models.
We generated separate risk estimates for the following
age categories: 1) 0–10 years (children); 2) 11–54 years
(older children and adults); and 3) 55–103 years (older
adults). The age groups were selected on the basis of sample
size considerations and previous research (16). All analyses
were completed by using SAS, version 9, software (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Stata, version 9,
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS

A total of 29,100 beach exit interviews were completed.
A total of 27,365 telephone interviews were completed 10–
12 days later. Of these telephone interviews, 26,609 had
complete information on the full set of key covariates and
were retained for analysis.

Respondents at the 7 beaches differed by age, race/
ethnicity, miles traveled to the beach, and proportion of individuals who reported digging in sand. Those who dug in the
sand were younger than those who did not dig in the sand
(median ages, 14 and 35 years, respectively) but were equally
likely to report vomiting, other gastrointestinal symptoms,
rash, eye irritation, earache, and a history of chronic respiratory problems or asthma at baseline (Table 1). Individuals
who dug in the sand had a tendency to report less chronic
gastrointestinal illness (2% vs. 3%), fewer chronic allergies
(18% vs. 20%), and less consumption of red or raw meat prior
to or immediately after the beach visit (8% vs. 11%). Individuals who dug in the sand reported more instances of infected cuts or wounds at baseline (8% vs. 5%), more contact
with animals 48 hours prior to or immediately after the beach
visit (77% vs. 72%), and more swimming, defined as any
contact with the water (82% vs. 52%). Those who had their
body buried in the sand showed a similar pattern of differences compared with those who did not have their body
buried in sand (Table 1). Digging in sand and being buried
in the sand were also strongly associated with any water

The numbers are those reporting new symptoms, among those without baseline symptoms. For gastrointestinal

contact. Participants at Washington Park Beach reported digging in the sand (47%) and being buried in the sand (16%)
most frequently, followed by West Beach participants digging
in the sand (46%) and buried in the sand (13%).
Relation between sand contact activities and illness

The adjusted risk of gastrointestinal illness among those
who dug in the sand was 1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI):
1.02, 1.25) times the risk of gastrointestinal illness among
those who did not dig in the sand (Table 2). The adjusted risk
of diarrhea among those who dug in the sand was 1.20 (95%
CI: 1.05, 1.36) times the risk of diarrhea among those who
did not dig in the sand (Table 2).
The crude incidence of upper respiratory illness was higher
among those who dug in the sand compared with those who
did not dig in the sand, but adjustment reduced the difference
(aIPR ¼ 1.05, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.19) (Table 2). Age was
a strong confounder because younger respondents more often
both dug in the sand and reported upper respiratory illness.
The remaining nonenteric illnesses did not show a strong or
consistent positive association with digging in the sand.
Generally, being buried in the sand was more strongly
associated with enteric illness than was digging in the sand
among all subjects. The aIPR of gastrointestinal illness

among those who had their bodies buried in the sand was
1.23 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.43) (Table 2). The aIPR of diarrhea
was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.52) (Table 2). For the nonenteric
illnesses, no consistent increase in risk was observed among
those buried in the sand compared with those not buried in
the sand (Table 2).
A slightly elevated risk of gastrointestinal illness was
observed among children who dug in the sand (aIPR ¼
1.22, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.60) (Table 3). There was no evidence
of increased gastrointestinal illness risk associated with digging in sand among adults 55 years of age or older (aIPR ¼
0.92, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.54) (Table 3). For diarrhea, the
aIPR for digging in the sand was highest among children
10 years of age or younger (aIPR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI: 1.00,
2.06) (Table 3). This observation was not consistent for all
age groups, sand exposures, and enteric illness outcomes.
The observed elevated enteric illness effect estimates among
those 55 years of age or older were imprecise (Table 3)
because of the low incidence of diarrhea (4%) and the low
prevalence of exposure (2%) and should be interpreted with
caution. The nonenteric illnesses did not show a strong or
consistent positive association with either of the sand
contact activities among the age subgroups.
The effect of sand exposure showed variation across the
beaches studied. aIPR estimates ranged from 0.98 to 1.91

The numbers are those reporting new symptoms, among those without baseline symptoms. The aIPR was estimated from log-risk binomial
regression models. Covariates in models included age, sex, and beach, and selection was through a change-in-estimate procedure from the
following: race/ethnicity, any contact swimming, contact with animals, contact with other persons with diarrhea, eating food while at the beach,
eating raw or undercooked meat since the time of the beach interview, eating raw or undercooked eggs since the time of the beach interview,
number of other visits to the beach, and any other chronic illnesses (gastrointestinal, skin, asthma). For upper respiratory illness and skin outcomes,
insect repellent and sun block use were also considered.

among those digging in the sand (Table 4). The strongest
associations were for gastrointestinal illness (aIPR ¼ 1.48,
95% CI: 1.02, 2.16) and diarrhea (aIPR ¼ 1.91, 95% CI:
1.27, 2.85) at Fairhope Beach (Table 4). The weakest associations were at Huntington Beach, where the aIPR was 0.98
(95% CI: 0.77, 1.26) for gastrointestinal illness and 1.01
(95% CI: 0.75, 1.35) for diarrhea. There was also variation
by type of beach (marine vs. freshwater). At the marine
beaches, the adjusted risk of diarrhea among those who
dug in the sand was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.90) times the
risk of diarrhea among those who did not dig in the sand
(Table 4). This association was also somewhat elevated for
gastrointestinal illness at marine beaches (aIPR ¼ 1.26,
95% CI: 0.98, 1.56) (Table 4). Similar variability was observed among participants buried in the sand (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

The results of our study suggest that, among beachgoers
participating in a large prospective cohort study at beaches
nearby sewage treatment discharges, reported contact with
beach sand (defined as either digging in the sand or having
one’s body buried in the sand) was associated with an eleAm J Epidemiol 2009;170:164–172

vated risk of enteric illnesses (gastrointestinal illness and
diarrhea). Being buried in the sand was more strongly associated with enteric illness than was digging in the sand. We
also observed a higher proportion of people who got sand in
their mouth among those buried in the sand (40%) compared
with those who dug in the sand (20%).
This is one of the first studies to demonstrate an association with specific sand contact activities. One previous
study demonstrated that time spent in the wet sand was
associated with a dose-dependent increase in gastrointestinal illness (per 10-minute increase spent in contact with wet
sand: adjusted odds ratio ¼ 1.008, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.015)
(16). The variability that we observed across beaches, however, indicates that risks may be site specific and may depend on the characteristics of each beach.
These results provide limited evidence that children aged
10 years or less may be at higher risk of gastrointestinal
illness and diarrhea following digging in the sand, and we
also observed that children had a much higher frequency of
exposure to sand (80% reported digging in sand). Results
from the 2007 beach sites also indicate that children aged
10 years or less had a higher frequency of getting sand in
their mouth (20%) compared with older children and adults
(11–54 years) (4%) and older adults (55 years) (2%).

The numbers are those reporting new symptoms, among those without baseline symptoms. aIPR was estimated
from log-risk binomial regression models. Covariates in models included age, sex, and beach, and selection was
through a change-in-estimate procedure from the following: race/ethnicity, any contact swimming, contact with
animals, contact with other persons with diarrhea, eating food while at the beach, eating raw or undercooked meat

to the beach, and any other chronic illnesses (gastrointestinal, skin, asthma). For upper respiratory illness and skin
outcomes, insect repellent and sun block use were also considered.

We observed beach-specific variation in the enteric illness
risk following beach sand contact. This could have been due
to a number of site-specific differences at the beaches studied, including factors such as sand composition (e.g., clay,

silt, loam), particle size, moisture and organic content, nutrient availability, osmotic pressure, tidal phenomena, wave
action, currents, salinity, and algae/seaweed density that
may impact the sand and survival/density of fecal indicator

Contact With Beach Sand and Risk of Illness

organisms and pathogens (17, 37–41). Human factors, such
as bather density and sand-grooming practices (such as daily
tilling), may also impact beach sand quality (14, 38). The
observed variation in enteric illness risks across beaches
could also be explained by different levels of fecal pollution
influencing recreational waters and sand from sources including sewage discharges from publicly owned treatment
works, non-point source runoff (e.g., domestic and wild
animals, urban storm water), and bathers.
The observed beach-specific variation in enteric illness
risk and the stronger association between sand contact and
enteric illness at marine beaches warrant further investigation. We examined potential effect measure modification by
beach and by marine versus freshwater beaches by comparing a model with interaction terms with a model without
using a likelihood ratio test. Despite the wide range of estimates presented in Table 4, there was little statistical evidence of heterogeneity across the 7 beaches (v26df ¼ 2.60,
P ¼ 0.8575). However, there was some evidence of
heterogeneity by marine beaches versus freshwater beaches
(v21df ¼ 2.27, P ¼ 0.1318).
There was little evidence of effect measure modification
by swimming status. Nonswimmers who dug in the sand had
a similar risk of gastrointestinal illness (aIPR ¼ 1.26, 95%
CI: 1.03, 1.54) and diarrhea (aIPR ¼ 1.26, 95% CI: 0.98,
1.62) compared with swimmers who dug in the sand for
gastrointestinal illness (aIPR ¼ 1.11, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.25)
and diarrhea (aIPR ¼ 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.37).
Some of the illnesses studied were nonspecific (e.g., gastrointestinal illness, eye irritation) and may have been affected by recall bias. However, the NEEAR Study’s focus
was swimmers’ health, and it is unlikely that participants’
recall of illness would have been influenced by their recall
of sand exposure. We expected that participants’ recall of
illness would have been nondifferential with respect to sand
exposure status. In our study, nondifferential recall of illness
with respect to sand exposure would have resulted in unbiased estimates, although there could have been a loss of
precision if there was underrecall (or underreporting) of
illness among participants (36). The association between
contact with sand and enteric illnesses was robust to varying
definitions of sand contact (digging in the sand, being buried
in the sand) and definitions of enteric illness (gastrointestinal illness, diarrhea). Strengths of our study include large
sample size, ability to follow a cohort of people who reported no disease within the past 3 days, and a high level
of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most
comprehensive investigation of the association between specific beach sand contact activities and risk of illness.
These findings suggest a need for future studies of relations between quantitative measures of beach sand quality
(i.e., fecal indicator organism concentrations in beach sand)
and measures of beach sand exposure and illness. Seasonal
visitation of coastal beaches is a favored pastime in the
United States. The National Survey on Recreation and
the Environment found that, during 1999–2000, 43% of
the civilian population, 16 years of age or older, participated
in marine outdoor recreation activities, equivalent to 89
million individuals (42). Although the aIPRs in this study
are modest in magnitude, suggesting an increased risk on the
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:164–172

171

order of 20%–50% depending on the age range and type of
sand exposure, the results are of public health importance
because of the large numbers of people who recreate at
beaches and who are exposed to sand. If the relation between sand exposure and enteric illness is causal, many
cases of illness could be prevented by decreasing microbial
burdens in beach sand.
