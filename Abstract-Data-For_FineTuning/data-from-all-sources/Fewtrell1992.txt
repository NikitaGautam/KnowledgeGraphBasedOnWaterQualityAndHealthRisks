Health effects of white-water canoeing

There is little quantitative information on the
relation between water quality and disease attack
rates after recreational activities in fresh water. We
conducted a prospective cohort study to measure the
health effects of white-water and slalom canoeing in
two channels with different degrees of microbial
contamination.
Site A, fed by a lowland river, showed high
enterovirus concentrations (arithmetic mean 198 pfu
per 10 litre and moderate faecal coliform
concentrations (geometric mean 285/dl); at site B,
from an upland impoundment, all samples were free
of enteroviruses and the geometric mean faecal
coliform concentration was 22/dl. Between 5 and 7
days after exposure canoeists using site A had
significantly higher incidences of gastrointestinal
and upper respiratory symptoms than canoeists
using site B or non-exposed controls (spectators).
Like seawater bathers, fresh-water canoeists can
be made ill by sewage contamination. The hazard of
fresh water may be best measured by counting of
viruses rather than bacteria.
Introduction
is made of inland waters by canoeists, water
skiers, sailboarders, and casual bathers; and, as with
seawater bathing, the effects of sewage contamination give
cause for concern.1,2 Opinions differ on whether the same
microbiological safety standards should be applied to
marine and fresh recreational waters.2,3 Further, there is
currently a debate about possible changes to the
microbiological standards in the European Bathing Water
Directive.4 Although the LTK maintains that this directive
relates exclusively to coastal bathing waters, other member

countries apply it to inland freshwater sites and its standards
are used as a guide by recreational groups. Notwithstanding
earlier research5-7 there are insufficient data to determine the
microbiological dose-response relation between water
quality and disease attack rates for the various freshwater
activities. We have used methods developed in
epidemiological studies at marine bathing sites8 to measure
the health effects of canoeing in two slalom channels with
different water quality.

Methods
At site A, an artificial concrete channel diverts water around a
weir in the river’s main channel and provides facilities for
white-water and slalom canoeing. The water comes from a large
lowland river receiving effluent from several sewage treatment
plants upstream. Site B receives water from a pristine upland
impoundment. Water samples were taken at each site during the
event. Bacteriological analysis included counts of faecal coliforms,9
faecal streptococci,9 and total staphylococci.10 Samples were also
assessed for enteroviruses" by measurement of plaque forming
units (pfu) with Buffalo green monkey kidney cells and the
suspended cell method; poliovirus 2 was used as a control.
Subjects were recruited by advertising in the canoeing press and
by approaching canoeists and spectators before the events. Data on
age, sex, occupation, place of residence, water activities including
canoeing, consumption of various foods, and illness were obtained
on a structured questionnaire by trained interviewers, initially on
arrival. Participants were interviewed a second time on leaving the
site to determine water exposure, and 5-7 days later a third
interview was conducted by telephone to record subsequent illness.
A fourth questionnaire was sent by post so that subjects could
record illness experienced between the second interview and 28

days.

Site A showed higher counts of faecal coliforms
(p 0-001) and faecal streptococci (p < 005) than site B. The
arithmetic mean enterovirus concentration from site A (198
pfu/ 10 litre) was likewise significantly higher than the zero at
site B (p < 0.001) (table I).
A total of 572 subjects were recruited-304 at site A and
268 at site B, of whom 160 and 218, respectively, engaged in
canoeing. Information on exposure of 8 subjects from site A
and 3 from site B was not obtained and these were excluded
from further analysis. 516 subjects (90%) completed
interviews at 5-7 days and 366 (64%) at one month.

p<0-01: RR 178, 95% CI 1-17-270). Site B exposed
subjects reported a significant excess only of respiratory
symptoms at 5-7 days.
When we compare canoeists at site A with those at site B
the frequency in the reporting of all symptom groups was
significantly higher at 5-7 days and this excess persisted at
one month for GI symptoms (40/109 vs 24/126, p<001:
RR 1 -93,95% CI 1-25-2-98) and skin symptoms (14/109 vs
6/126, p < 005; RR 2-70, 95% CI 1 07-678).
In site-A participants the excess of illness at 5-7 days in
the exposed group persisted when allowance was made for
age, gender, and hamburger consumption. By contrast, at
site B the excess of respiratory symptoms observed in the
canoeing group was no longer significant when stratified by
gender, although the relative risk was not much altered (RR
1.53 95% CI: 0-94-2-48). With controlling for age and
gender, at one month the only significant difference between
canoeists from the two sites was an excess of GI symptoms in
site-A participants.

Discussion
The two sites represent the extremes of water quality
encountered by white-water canoeists in the UK. The
results suggest that microbiological contamination, as
reflected by indicator bacteria and enteroviruses, is
associated with an appreciable burden of illness in canoeists.
A weakness of the study design is that the exposed and
non-exposed subjects were self-selected. 12 Thus, the
canoeists were more likely to be male and eat hamburgers;
however, accurate recording of potential confounding
factors was possible and these do not explain the differences
observed.
Because there were no significant differences in
symptoms between any of the groups before exposure, the
most plausible explanation for the post-exposure excess at
site A is poor quality water. A further indication that this is
so is the similarity between symptom frequencies in the two
exposed groups on the study day compared with the excess
confined to canoeists at site A at 5-7 days. Indeed, at site B
only respiratory symptoms were reported significantly more
frequently in the exposed than the non-exposed group. This
may be a gender effect, but previous investigators13 have
suggested that certain symptoms developing after exposure
at microbiologically uncontaminated sites are due to thermal
shock, endogenous infection, or chemical irritation.
The response to the 4-week follow-up was low. These
questionnaires were self-administered, unlike the previous
interviews. However, the results are broadly consistent with

those at 5-7 days and the persistent excess of GI symptoms
in the exposed group at site A may represent infection with
pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp or Giardia
intestinalis.
The finding that illness occurred more frequently after
canoeing in fresh water at a site A receiving sewage effluent
agrees broadly with results of sea bathing research in the
UK.8 Bacterial concentrations were not strikingly high by
comparison with UK seawaters. The enterovirus
concentrations, however, were considerably higher14 than
those recorded in marine waters with similar enteric
bacterial concentrations.8 This may be explained by the
contribution from sewage works effluent. Sewage treatment
produces greater attenuation of bacterial than viral
concentrations.1s Thus enteroviruses, although presumably
not causing the symptoms, may provide a better indicator of
fresh water quality than the bacteria measured.
White-water canoeing in poor quality water leads to a
measurable amount of illness. Further studies are needed to
determine whether there is a dose-response relation with
microbial contamination. If so, knowledge of this relation
would be valuable for both water quality standard
formulation and public education.

VIEWPOINT
Indian medical journals

Although Indian doctors produce half the articles
published from the third world, little has been written
about Indian medical journals. We examined 75 of
the 113 serious English-language journals published
in India. Of the 22 included in the Cumulated Index
Medicus only 8 were judged by Indian and foreign
referees to be of international standard. A survey of
Indian authors indicated that foreign journals were
chosen for the best papers because of their wider
circulation, better refereeing practices, and
punctuality. More than 98% of medical articles from
India probably go unnoticed by the international
medical community.

Introduction
Medical journals published in western countries have
been catalogued and studied in great detail, often from the
Science Citation Index. This provides data on nearly 3000 of

estimated 50 000 journals that are published
internationally. It includes, however, only 3 Indian medical
journals despite the fact that India (which has approximately
250 000 practitioners of western medicine) accounts for
almost half the articles published from the third world. India
produces a large number of journals that are not included in
any indexing system and have never been studied in detail.
We therefore undertook an in-depth examination of Indian
medical journals.
the

Methods
Lists of Indian medical journals were made from the Annual
Report of the Registrar of Newspapers for India of 1984 and 1986,
and from these we recorded the date of first publication, subjects
covered, periodicity, circulation, and sponsoring bodies.
