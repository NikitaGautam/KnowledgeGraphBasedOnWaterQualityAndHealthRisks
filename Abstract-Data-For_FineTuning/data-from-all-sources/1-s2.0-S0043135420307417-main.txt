In tropical to temperate environments, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as enterococci and Escherichia
coli, can persist and potentially multiply, far removed from their natural reservoir of the animal gut. FIB
isolated from environmental reservoirs such as stream sediments, beach sand and vegetation have been
termed “naturalized” FIB. In addition, recent research suggests that the intestines of poikilothermic animals such as ﬁsh may be colonized by enterococci and E. coli, and therefore, these animals may contribute
to FIB concentrations in the aquatic environment.
Naturalized FIB that are derived from fecal inputs into the environment, and subsequently adapted to
maintain their population within the non-host environment are termed “naturalized enteric FIB”. In contrast, an additional theory suggests that some “naturalized” FIB diverged from enteric FIB many millions
of years ago and are now normal inhabitants of the environment where they are referred to as “naturalized non-enteric FIB”. In the case of the Escherichia genus, the naturalized non-enteric members are
identiﬁed as E. coli during routine water quality monitoring. An over-estimation of the health risk could
result when these naturalized, non-enteric FIB, (that is, not derived from avian or mammalian fecal contamination), contribute to water quality monitoring results. It has been postulated that these environmental FIB belonging to the genera Escherichia and Enterococcus can be differentiated from enteric FIB
by genetic methods because they lack some of the genes required for colonization of the host intestine,
and have acquired genes that aid survival in the environment. Advances in molecular tools such as next
generation sequencing will aid the identiﬁcation of genes peculiar or “enriched” in particular habitats to
discriminate between enteric and environmental FIB.
In this appraisal, we have reviewed the research studying “naturalized” FIB, and discussed the techniques
for their differentiation from enteric FIB. This differentiation includes the important distinction between
enteric FIB derived from fresh and non-recent fecal inputs, and those truly non-enteric environmental
microbes, which are currently identiﬁed as FIB during routine water quality monitoring. The inclusion of
tools for the identiﬁcation of naturalized FIB (enteric or environmental) would be a valuable resource for
future studies assessing water quality.

1. Introduction
Recreational water activities such as swimming and boating
are an important part of the lifestyle in western countries with
over 60% of the United States population engaging in water sports
(DeFlorio-Barker et al., 2018). These activities, however, come with
a substantial economic cost due to the burden of associated waterborne illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms (DeFlorioBarker et al., 2017; DeFlorio-Barker et al., 2018). Fecal contamination of recreational waters is a major source of pathogens that
cause waterborne disease (Korajkic et al., 2018). There are, however, many constraints associated with the detection of pathogens
in water contaminated by feces. These constraints include the
high cost of pathogen testing, intermittent carriage of pathogens
by an animal community, and the technical diﬃculties of detecting the low concentration of pathogens usually present in water
(Soller et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011). As a result, most water monitoring schemes use the identiﬁcation of indicators of fecal inputs
as a surrogate to pathogen detection.
In fresh, untreated sewage, E. coli and enterococci are considered good indicators of potential risk to human health from fecal
pathogens because they are present in high concentrations in the
feces of mammals (Sadowsky and Whitman, 2011; USEPA, 1996).
After discharge of sewage into the aquatic environment, however,
the relationship between these fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and
the pathogens of concern may change due to a range of factors
such as dilution, water ﬂow characteristics and survival of the
pathogens in the environment (Ahmed et al., 2018; Boehm et al.,
2018; Boehm et al., 2015; Devane et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2018).
The ability to determine the presence of pathogens in aquatic environments using fecal microbial indicators has been investigated by
researchers with mixed results for indicator-pathogen correlations
using both traditional FIB, and microbial source tracking (MST)
markers. Korajkic et al. (2018) examined over 73 studies conducted
within a 40-year time span, and corroborated the views of many
researchers and reviewers who have noted that no single indicator
is suﬃcient to predict all pathogens (bacteria, viruses and protozoa).
Most recreational water quality criteria (RWQC) are based on
scientiﬁc conclusions drawn from the relationship between con-

centrations of culturable fecal indicator bacteria and rates of gastrointestinal illness (GI) attributed to recreational water activities
(Strachan et al., 2012; Thoe et al., 2018; Wade et al., 2003). In
international epidemiological studies, enterococci have been recognized as better predictors of GI illness in marine waters than
E. coli (Wade et al., 2008; Wade et al., 2006; Wade et al., 2010),
and more recently, also recognized as suitable predictors for freshwaters (USEPA, 2012). In many situations, however, the eﬃcacy
of FIB as indicators of health risk from fecal contamination, has
been questioned, particularly where the dominant sources of fecal microbes in water has changed from high levels of contamination related to human fecal inputs, to lower levels of diffuse pollution from a range of non-human and human sources (Evans et al.,
2019; Fujioka et al., 2015). Point sources of fecal contamination
such as wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants generally result in very high levels of FIB, which are more readily
identiﬁed compared with diffuse pollution sources (Devane et al.,
2014). Non-point sources of diffuse pollution such as leaking sewer
pipes or septic tanks, wildlife sources and agricultural land runoff
may represent lower but persistent concentrations of FIB elevated
above guideline concentrations. These diffuse sources may be a
mixture of recent and aged fecal inputs, which are diﬃcult to
trace and require more sophisticated genetic and chemical tools
for tracking the source of fecal contamination (Devane et al., 2018;
Hagedorn et al., 2011; Teixeira et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2015).
In addition to the above factors, the role of FIB as indicators of water quality has been debated due to research revealing
their growth and/or persistence in the environment (Jang et al.,
2017; Mulugeta et al., 2012; Teixeira et al., 2020; Walk 2015;
Whitman et al., 2014; Whitman et al., 2006). FIB are no longer
considered to be exclusively found in the gut of warm-blooded
animal hosts with a short survival time once excreted into the
environment (Frick et al., 2018). When fecal coliforms (including
E. coli) were ﬁrst proposed as a method of assessing water quality it was thought that fecal coliforms were only able to survive
and replicate in the homeostatic intestinal environment of their
animal host (Geldreich, 1966). Replication of FIB in water environments was considered unlikely because ambient temperatures
ranged from 4 to 25 °C and nutrient status was in continual ﬂux
(Geldreich, 1966). When the survival of FIB in the environment was

ﬁrst reported, studies were limited to tropical areas where higher
temperatures were suggested as aiding their survival and growth
(Byappanahalli and Fujioka, 1998; Jimenez et al., 1989). However,
further work established the same trend for the persistence of
indicator bacteria in subtropical environments (Anderson et al.,
2005; Desmarais et al., 2002; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2000) and
temperate environments (Byappanahalli et al., 2003a; Ishii et al.,
2006a; McLellan 2004; Whitman and Nevers, 2003) (Table 1).
These ground-breaking studies showed the ability of FIB to persist and replicate in the environment under nutrient regimes and
temperatures not previously thought credible by scientists and led
to the terms “naturalized” E. coli and enterococci. It was recognized
that identiﬁcation of these environmentally-adapted FIB as part of
a water quality monitoring program could overestimate the health
risk from fecal pathogens, which are usually associated with fresh
fecal sources. However, identiﬁcation of naturalized fecal FIB associated with non-recent fecal inputs may still indicate a health
risk from pathogens persisting in the aquatic environment. This
circumstance was noted in the study of an urban river receiving
major raw sewage discharges over six months, where the concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Giardia were found to be higher
in the sediments after the discharges ceased (Devane et al., 2014).
In this scenario, no Cryptosporidium and reduced concentrations of
Giardia were found in the overlying water post-discharge, illustrating that there can be a potential risk from pathogens persisting in
sediments, which are disconnected from recent fecal inputs.
In the last decades with the advent of whole genome analysis
of bacteria, other sources of naturalized FIB have been proposed
that are not derived from fecal sources (non-fecal FIB). These “true”
environmental strains may only now be recognized as different
to enteric enterococcus and E. coli due to new sequencing technologies, which allow a greater understanding of the thousands of
genes present in each of these microorganisms (He et al., 2018;
Walk, 2015). It is postulated that some “naturalized” FIB diverged
from enteric FIB many millions of years ago and are currently nat-

ural inhabitants of the environment (Jang et al., 2017; Staley et al.,
2014; Walk, 2015; Walk et al., 2009; Weigand et al., 2014). This latter group containing non-E. coli members of the Escherichia genus
and the environmental enterococci are still identiﬁed as belonging
to the FIB by conventional biochemical testing and water quality
monitoring methods (Byappanahalli et al., 2012a; He et al., 2018;
Jang et al., 2017; Walk, 2015; Walk et al., 2009).
In the case of the Escherichia genus, many conventional water quality testing methods enumerate E. coli by targeting its ßD-glucuronidase activity (Bej et al., 1991; Maheux et al., 2015;
Shadix and Rice, 1991). Other species in the Escherichia genus,
however, have been identiﬁed that also possess this enzyme activity and test positive using conventional methods, thereby potentially confounding interpretations of water quality by overestimating the risk to recreational users (Deng et al., 2014). Genetic technologies are being developed that enable discrimination of the enteric FIB from naturalized (non-enteric) Escherichia and Enterococcus species. Discrimination of these naturalized species has been
proposed based on the absence of genes required for colonization
of the host intestine, and the acquisition of genes that aid survival
in the post-excretion environment (Luo et al., 2011; Weigand et al.,
2014).
In this review, research investigating naturalized sources of FIB
and their identiﬁcation as fecal indicators is discussed, examining whether overestimates of health risk occur during routine water quality monitoring. The review describes the important distinction between those enteric FIB derived from fresh and non-recent
fecal inputs, and those truly non-fecal/non-enteric environmental
microbes, which are currently identiﬁed as FIB using conventional
water quality monitoring tests. It discusses environmental nonfecal reservoirs/sources of FIB and highlights research into genetic
techniques for discriminating between fecal FIB and naturalized FIB
(both enteric and environmental), and suggests the areas where research is required to advance the development and understanding
of these genetic tools for future environmental studies.

2. Genera of the fecal indicator bacteria
2.1. The Escherichia genus
Escherichia have previously been characterized as containing
the six different species: E. coli, E. albertii, E. fergusonii, E. blattae, E. hermannii, and E. vulneris (Alm et al., 2011). As reviewed by
Alm et al. (2011) and Chaudhuri and Henderson (2012), this classiﬁcation was based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies and phenotypic analyses. Subsequent analyses of nucleotide sequences of 16S
ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) and housekeeping genes
has suggested that the Escherichia genus should only contain the
three species: E. coli, E. albertii, E. fergusonii, which form a monophyletic lineage. Recently in China, an Escherichia strain was isolated from the feces of a marmot, and showed 99.2% homology to
E. coli 16S rRNA, sharing <70% DNA-DNA hybridization with other
species of Escherichia. These ﬁndings led to the proposal that it is a
novel species, E. marmotae, within the Escherichia genus (Liu et al.,
2019; Liu et al., 2015).
It is recognized that the species E. coli has extensive genetic
diversity (Chaudhuri and Henderson, 2012; Touchon et al., 2020).
The average E. coli genome contains approximately 4700 genes but
only 20 0 0 of these genes are conserved between members of the E.
coli species and represent the core genome (Tenaillon et al., 2010).
The additional genes represent a genome of high plasticity allowing for environmental adaptations through the acquisition and loss
of multiple genes. Whole genome analysis has revealed that this
turnover of genes is largely driven by the transfer of mobile genetic elements (Touchon et al., 2020).
Clermont et al. (20 0 0) designed a triplex polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) method for assigning E. coli to four phylogenetic
groups (A, B1, B2 and D). This PCR system was subsequently updated to include three new phylogenetic groups identiﬁed by genomic data, and to recognize the novel Escherichia cryptic clades
(I-V) (Clermont et al., 2013). The Escherichia cryptic clades are discussed in detail in the next section. Recently, an additional phylogroup ‘G’ has been proposed (Clermont et al., 2019; Lu et al.,
2016), therefore, the species members of E. coli sensu stricto
(“strictly belonging to the species Escherichia coli”) are currently
recognized as forming eight main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2,
C, D, E, F and G) (Clermont et al., 2015; Clermont et al., 2019;
Touchon et al., 2020). These eight phylogroups are known to reside
primarily in the gut of animals and there is evidence to suggest
they are involved in distinct ecological roles (Smati et al., 2015;
Tenaillon et al., 2010). For example, in the developed world, B2
has been recognized as the dominant phylogroup in human feces,
whereas, in general, E. coli in the animal microbiota are dominated
by phylogroup B1 (Ambrosi et al., 2019; Vadnov et al., 2017).
Subsequently, the focus is changing from PCR characterization to using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify microbial species and strains (Clermont et al., 2015).
Beghain et al. (2018) have developed an in silico method for phy-

lotyping the Escherichia genus called the ClermonTyper and they
have made this free web resource accessible to the scientiﬁc community. Current identiﬁcation of E. coli strains present in a sample requires isolation of the colony before WGS, which is laborintensive and costly. Future studies will incorporate culture independent techniques which target genes that can investigate the inherent diversity of E. coli and provide greater resolution of the fecal
E. coli microbiota (Cookson et al., 2017).
2.1.1. Cryptic clades of Escherichia
In addition, to the known eight phylogenetic groups for E. coli
strains, a study using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identiﬁed ﬁve novel clades (designated Clades I to V) of Escherichia
(Walk et al., 2009). Clades are a phylogenetically distinct group
derived from a common ancestor. The original Escherichia cryptic
clades were isolated from freshwater beaches by standard methods used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for FIB in
recreational waters (USEPA 20 0 0; Walk, 2015; Walk et al., 2007).
Initially, the Escherichia clades were thought to be encompassed by
the E. coli species criterion, due to their lack of phenotypic differentiation from E. coli using traditional biochemical testing methods (Alm et al., 2011; Walk et al., 2007). The putative environmental clades of Escherichia have been shown to be phenotypically and
taxonomically indistinguishable to the enteric E. coli isolates using
the standardized API20E Identiﬁcation System (BioMerieux, Inc.)
and the BBL Crystal Identiﬁcation System (Becton, Dickinson and
Company) (Walk et al., 2009). The β -D-glucuronidase gene used
to conﬁrm E. coli in many culture and genetic-based water quality
tests, was also found to be 92 to 100% positive in all of the cryptic clade isolates (n = 24) (Deng et al., 2014). Comparison of the
cryptic clade 16S rDNA proﬁles with those of E. coli sensu stricto
conﬁrmed their identity as E. coli (Walk et al., 2009). In addition,
Walk et al. (2009) identiﬁed that only the phenotypic proﬁle of
Clade III was statistically different from the E. coli phenotype, due
to the inability of Clade III isolates to ferment sucrose and sorbitol,
and utilize lysine.
The term Escherichia “cryptic clades” was used to re-classify the
Clades I to V because of their lack of phenotypic differentiation
from E. coli using traditional biochemical proﬁles but their divergence from E. coli when applying genetic techniques (Walk et al.,
2009). Analysis of sequence databases of E. coli strains has infrequently turned up members of the Clades I - V (Walk et al., 2009).
These databases have a major focus on strains isolated from human
fecal samples, and therefore are representative of clinically relevant E. coli to the exclusion of other habitats, which remain under
sampled (Walk, 2015; Walk et al., 2009). For example, in a multicenter study of patients (n = 1081) with E. coli bacteremia, two
Clade V and one Clade III strains were isolated corroborating their
low pathogen potential (0.3% of E. coli isolates) (Clermont et al.,
2011; Lefort et al., 2011). The low prevalence of cryptic clades in
current databases of E. coli suggests they may not be indicative of
fecal contamination when identiﬁed in waterways.
Genomic sequencing of a range of enteric and environmental
Escherichia isolates revealed that while they all shared a core set
of approximately 20 0 0 genes, there were genes that were either
speciﬁc to, or highly represented in, either the Escherichia cryptic
clades or enteric E. coli groups (Luo et al., 2011). For example, enteric E. coli had speciﬁc functional genes related to the transport
and acquisition of nutrients abundant in the gut (e.g. gluconate).
In contrast, the functions of genes speciﬁc to the Escherichia cryptic clades were related to survival in a non-enteric environment,
such as enzymes that aid the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls.
These ﬁndings have been supported by a comparative microarray
DNA-DNA hybridization study, which identiﬁed bacterial adhesion
genes in enteric E. coli, important for host colonization by both
pathogenic and commensal intestinal isolates (Oh et al. (2012).

The phenotypes of the majority of enteric E. coli are positive for
the catabolism of lysine and ornithine (Clermont et al., 2011). In
the case of the Escherichia cryptic clades, the isolates were identiﬁed as being negative for lysine and/or ornithine catabolism, providing phenotypic traits that distinguished them from the enteric
E. coli (Clermont et al., 2011). The exception to this is Clade I where
the majority of isolates were positive for catabolism of both ornithine and lysine. Strains of Clade I were also shown to be genotypically very close to enteric E. coli, and therefore, could be classiﬁed as enteric bacteria (Deng et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2011). Further work identiﬁed a heat-labile toxin from members of Clade I
isolated from clinical cases of diarrhea with carriage of this virulence factor, distinguishing them as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
and conﬁrming their status as enteric Escherichia isolates with
pathogenic potential (Steinsland et al., 2010; Walk, 2015). The review of Walk (2015) outlines other studies where Escherichia Clade
I isolates have been identiﬁed in human cases of gastroenteritis,
and provides further discussion regarding whether Clade I should
be recognized as a subspecies of E. coli.
Comparison of the DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity scores used to designate species determination
provides evidence that Clades III and IV are subspecies of a novel
Escherichia species, while Clade V is a separate, novel member of
the Escherichia genus (Walk, 2015). In the case of Clade II, more
in-depth sequence analysis is required before any such species
designations can be postulated for this rarely isolated strain
(Walk, 2015). Classiﬁcation, however, is dynamic and with regards
to Clade V, two isolates of the avirulent Clade V from the study
of Luo et al. (2011) clustered with the novel Escherichia species, E.
marmotae, isolated from the feces of the marmot (Liu et al., 2019).
In comparison, as discussed in Walk (2015), Clades III and IV were
well differentiated from the other Escherichia species (Liu et al.,
2019). Recent phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis provides evidence for the incorporation of Clades III and IV as the two subspecies in a novel Escherichia species, E. ruysiae, which was originally isolated from the feces of a person who had travelled to Asia
(van der Putten et al., 2020). Interestingly, despite subsequent attempts to re-isolate the E. ruysiae from the human case, it was only
recovered on a single occasion, hinting that carriage and excretion
from the human gut was transient (van der Putten et al., 2020).
A study investigating the virulence potential of the putative
Escherichia cryptic clades observed that they were poor competitors in gut colonization compared with the enteric E. coli strains
(Ingle et al., 2011). Furthermore, although these Escherichia cryptic clades carried a varied range of virulence factors, they (including ﬁve Clade V isolates) were not found to be virulent in mouse
models of extraintestinal infection and were reported to be uncommon isolates from vertebrate hosts. All of these factors, suggested
they could be opportunistic pathogens rather than true inhabitants
of the intestine (Ingle et al., 2011). Other important characteristics
differentiating the cryptic clades from enteric E. coli isolates, include enhanced ability to form bioﬁlms, and low levels of antibiotic
resistance (Ingle et al., 2011). They also have a lower temperature
growth tolerance of 5 °C compared with 11 °C for the majority of E.
coli, whilst maintaining optimal growth temperatures of 41–42 °C
similar to other members of the Escherichia genus (Ingle et al.,
2011; Moreira et al., 2012). Their low occurrence in clinical settings
and in vertebrate hosts, and low level of antibiotic resistance and
virulence factors supports the hypothesis that the cryptic Clades IIV are not highly pathogenic, but rather opportunistic pathogens (as
reviewed by Walk (2015)).
Gene expression studies of growth and starvation conditions by
Vital et al. (2015) noted differential expression between Clades IV
and V, and two commensal E. coli strains. During starvation conditions, up-regulation of genes related to stress responses was noted
for cryptic clade strains, which potentially allowed faster adapta-

5

tions to poor nutrient environments external to the host-intestinal
niche. Di Sante et al. (2018) investigated the environmental survival strategy of bioﬁlm formation by comparing the Escherichia
cryptic clades and a commensal E. coli (K12) intestinal strain and
their abilities to produce extracellular matrices. When exposed to
unfavorable conditions of low temperature and nutrient deprivation, Clades III, IV and V strains but not the commensal strain, were
able to produce curli ﬁmbriae and cellulose to form an extracellular matrix (Di Sante et al., 2018). This extracellular matrix is postulated to assist bioﬁlm formation and adherence to abiotic surfaces,
thus acting as a potential survival mechanism in non-host environments. These survival mechanisms potentially increase the ﬁtness of cryptic clade species for exploiting non-host environments
(Ingle et al., 2011).
In a study investigating the virulence features of Clades III-V
that had been isolated from coastal marine sediments, 20 of the
138 putative E. coli isolates were classiﬁed as belonging to the environmental Escherichia cryptic clades (Vignaroli et al., 2015). Seventeen of these 20 environmental Escherichia were susceptible to
antimicrobials, and they all lacked the enteroaggregative E. coli
pathotype virulence genes. In addition, 60% were positive for a
gene encoding an enterotoxin (EAST1), and 70% for group II capsule production genes. Toxin and capsule production have been
noted as bacterial strategies for surviving environmental conditions
with beneﬁts including reduced competition from other microorganisms in the case of toxins, and desiccation and sunlight irradiation protection afforded by a capsule (Costerton et al., 1995;
Power et al., 2005; Valerio et al., 2010). Tissue culture adhesion
and invasion assays using the CaCo2 and INT407 mammalian intestinal cell lines were performed on eight of the environmental
Escherichia cryptic clade isolates, each varying in their gene content (Vignaroli et al., 2015). Clade V displayed the highest adhesion properties similar to intestinal strains, but none of the cryptic clades showed the ability to invade the intestinal cell lines
tested. The authors have suggested a dual role for Clade V, where
it has adapted to the environment but retains the ability for an
intestinal lifestyle with the potential for expression of virulence
traits (Vignaroli et al., 2015). This assertion has gained support
from the study of Liu et al. (2019) where phylogenetic analysis
of whole genome sequence data indicated clustering of fecal E.
marmotae strains with environmental Clade V isolates from the
study of Luo et al. (2011). Identiﬁcation of virulence genes, including enterotoxin (EAST1), in these E. marmotae fecal strains,
and their positive cell invasion (albeit at markedly lower levels
than Shigella strains) suggest their potential as invasive pathogens
(Liu et al., 2019). The study of Vignaroli et al. (2015) also identiﬁed a potential environmental biomarker, pduC, which encodes a
propanediol hydratase, and was statistically signiﬁcantly associated
with, but not exclusive to, the environmental Escherichia cryptic
clades.
It is important to have methods that discriminate between E. coli and the naturalized Escherichia cryptic clades
to avoid classifying waterways as non-compliant where nonfecal sources of Escherichia are contributing to conventional
E. coli water testing (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The quadruplex
PCR of Clermont et al. (2013) with additional PCR updates in
Clermont et al. (2019) for identiﬁcation of phylogroup G, enable initial screening of putative E. coli isolates into eight phylogroups but also into non-speciﬁc groupings of the Escherichia
cryptic clades. For example, one amplicon in the quadruplex
Clermont et al. (2013) PCR detects members of Clades III, IV
and V. The clades can then be further differentiated into individual clade designations by the speciﬁc PCR markers developed
by Clermont et al. (2011). These allele-speciﬁc PCRs target the aes
gene and the DNA fragment chuA to obtain discrimination between
all ﬁve cryptic clades.

Clermont et al. (2013) reported low reclassiﬁcation rates (8–
14%) for human E. coli isolates, but 54% reclassiﬁcation for avian
pathogenic E. coli isolates (Logue et al., 2017). This revision included some E. coli (< 1%) that were retyped from A or B2 to
cryptic Clade I (Logue et al., 2017). Another comparative analysis of
E. coli isolates re-typed by the Clermont et al. (2013) method, identiﬁed that more human isolates and less avian isolates required
re-classiﬁcation in comparison to the study of Logue et al. (2017),
emphasizing differences between host environments (Starčič Erjavec et al., 2017). These researchers also noted a higher number
of non-typable (NT) isolates in their study and suggested the need
to identify novel host environments where these NT E. coli reside
so that whole genome analyses can be performed and new phylotyping schemes developed for NT isolates (Starčič Erjavec et al.,
2017). It should be noted that neither of these comparative
studies reclassiﬁed E. coli phylogroups to any of the Clade II-V
groups. The ﬁndings of these studies using the new PCR tools for

(re)classiﬁcation adds to the evidence that the cryptic Clades II-V
are present at low frequency in E. coli culture collections.
Other researchers are investigating PCR methods for differentiating between naturalized Escherichia and enteric E. coli, as PCR
would provide the most eﬃcient genetic classiﬁcation system for
water managers (Table 2). Deng et al. (2014) identiﬁed a gene that
is likely to be important for the enteric population of E. coli to survive the intestinal environment and proposed that identiﬁcation of
the putative glucosyltransferase gene (ycjM) in E. coli may conﬁrm
a recent fecal origin. However, there was not a clear delineation,
because although ycjM was identiﬁed in >97% of 398 of clinical
and fecal E. coli isolates from animals and birds, it was also identiﬁed in 28% of the isolates of the Escherichia Clades II-V. However,
the ycjM marker was an improvement on PCRs that target the β -Dglucuronidase gene as an identiﬁer of E. coli, where >92% of cryptic
clade isolates were positive (Deng et al., 2014).
A PCR method incorporating the dye, Propidium monoazide
(PMA), to target only viable bacteria has also been investigated using a modiﬁcation of the ycjM gene target of Deng et al. (2014) to

differentiate E. coli from the non-E. coli (false positives) (Yuan et al.,
2018). The attempt to reduce the number of false-positives
for E. coli detection (96% speciﬁcity for ycjM) in drinking
and environmental waters showed statistically comparable results between PMA-qPCR E. coli levels and standard culturable
methods (Yuan et al., 2018). However, turbidity was an issue and pretreatment of water samples was suggested prior to
analysis.
A PCR targeting the ybbW gene (a putative allantoin transporter
gene) was developed that reported 100% speciﬁcity and sensitivity for E. coli when tested against closely related species including
four other Escherichia species and Shigella (Walker et al., 2017). In
environmental waters there was a log-linear relationship between
E. coli counts in the water and the copy number of ybbW measured
by the PCR assay. Further investigations with this ybbW marker in
a qPCR method has also demonstrated 100% speciﬁcity with E. coli
compared to 22 other enteric bacterial species (McQuillan and Wilson, 2019), but its speciﬁcity against the Escherichia cryptic clades
remains to be determined. If this PCR marker excludes the cryptic
clades, it could overcome the issue of concurrent detection with E.
coli during water quality monitoring.
2.1.2. Habitats for Escherichia cryptic clades
Identiﬁcation of Clades III-V in Australia, United States and
Puerto Rico by extended MLST suggest a wide geographic representation for the environmental Escherichia cryptic clades (Walk et al.,
2009). There is growing evidence of the presence of the Escherichia
Clades II-V in the feces of avian and feral animals, and to date,
Clade V has been the most abundant of the environmental Escherichia cryptic clades isolated (Blyton et al., 2015; Clermont et al.,
2011; Vignaroli et al., 2015). Table 3 presents the geographical locations and environmental/animal habitats where Escherichia cryptic
clades have been identiﬁed.
The identiﬁcation of the Escherichia Clades II-V as better
adapted to the non-intestinal environments of water, soil, freshwater beach sand and sediment has led researchers to develop
the Environmental Hypothesis (Walk, 2015). Based on their extremely low prevalence in host-associated culture-collections, es-

pecially from clinical sources, it has been hypothesized that “the
cryptic clades are more abundant in, and better adapted to habitats
outside the host compared with inside the host” (excluding Clade
I) (Walk, 2015). This environmental hypothesis supports the comparative genomic analyses, which have revealed genes conserved
in enteric strains such as genes important for adhesion to the gut
wall, which are not present in environmental strains (Luo et al.,
2011; Oh et al., 2012).
A study of the prevalence of the cryptic clades isolated from
duck pond water and duck feces provided support for the Environmental Hypothesis (Table 3) (Walk, 2015). The study identiﬁed
cryptic clade isolates in the pond water but not in the duck feces. Additional research, however, is required to establish whether
wildlife represent a ‘spillover’ host for Clades II–V due to transient
passage and proximity of wildlife to water sources or if these animals are a reservoir for the cryptic clades (Alonso et al., 2017;
Walk, 2015).
There are few sampling studies that have genotypically characterized Escherichia (coli) isolates from various non-animal environments. However, further analyses will be assisted with additional
testing of Escherichia isolates using PCR and in silico WGS cultureindependent techniques (Beghain et al., 2018; Clermont et al.,
2013; Clermont et al., 2011; Cookson et al., 2017). Fig. 1 presents a
decision tree for a sampling protocol to differentiate putative naturalized Escherichia (either naturalized E. coli or Escherichia cryptic clade isolates) from fecal inputs of E. coli. Application of this
sampling protocol to waterways where the putative elevated E. coli
levels (detected during conventional water quality monitoring) are
suspected to be derived from non-recent fecal inputs could determine the prevalence of Escherichia cryptic clades within the aquatic
environment. In addition, identiﬁcation of clonally related subtypes
of a particular E. coli phylogroup that is numerically dominant in
a sediment sample may be indicative of a naturalized E. coli strain
that has adapted to the non-host environment and is either persisting or replicating within the sediment (Brinkmeyer et al., 2015;
Liang et al., 2016; Shelton et al., 2014). Studies of the environmental reservoirs of Escherichia are discussed in further detail in

Section 3, including recent studies that have differentiated E. coli
phylogroups from Escherichia cryptic clade isolates.
2.2. The Enterococcus genus
Members of the Enterococcus genus were formerly included
in the genus Streptococcus until 1984, when nucleic acid hybridization studies revealed that they were only distantly related
to other Streptococcus members (as reviewed in Byappanahalli
et al. (2012a)). A new genus, Enterococcus was, therefore, created
with 36 currently known species divided into ﬁve groups. Enterococcus are gram positive, spherical/ovoid cells arranged in chains or
in pairs. They are non-spore formers, facultative anaerobes and deﬁned by a temperature growth range of 10 to 45 °C, and their ability to grow in sodium chloride (6.5%) and high pH (9.6) conditions
(Facklam et al., 2002; Sherman, 1937). These factors, together with
their resistance to bile acids and desiccation, enable them to be
robust survivors in post-intestinal environments (Aarestrup et al.,
2002; Staley et al., 2014).
As reviewed by Byappanahalli et al. (2012a), most Enterococcus species are identiﬁed in an animal habitat including that of
humans, and in the gut of insects. The yellow pigmented species
of E. casseliﬂavus and E. mundtii have been predominantly associated with environmental sources such as plants and soil but also as
pathogenic to humans (Aarestrup et al., 2002; Collins et al., 1986;
Collins et al., 1984). The predominant enterococci species identiﬁed in animal and human intestinal environments are E. faecalis
and E. faecium; these are also the most commonly identiﬁed environmental species (see the reviews of Ogier and Serror (2008),
Staley et al. (2014) and Garcia-Solache and Rice (2019)). In terms
of water quality monitoring, it is important to be able to differentiate between those enterococci associated with environmental matrices such as plants and soils, and those that are derived
from fecal habitats. It is diﬃcult to differentiate between these
categories as some enterococci could be normal inhabitants, or
environmental contaminants from fecal sources (Aarestrup et al.,
2002; Badgley et al., 2010a). During an evaluation of the European
Bathing Water Directive standard methods for enumeration of intestinal enterococci, Tiwari et al. (2018) found that 93% of conﬁrmed isolates were identiﬁed as either E. faecalis or E. faecium using partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Environmental enterococci including E. gallinarum and E. casseliﬂavus were also identiﬁed at all bathing sites, albeit in low numbers. Both of these enterococci species have also been identiﬁed in the feces of gull species
(Fogarty et al., 2003).
Evaluation of genome sequencing of enterococci isolates from
enteric environments identiﬁed speciﬁc gene signatures for carbohydrate utilization of sugars, such as xylose, which are prevalent in the gut (Weigand et al., 2014). The genome of 11 isolates
of Enterococcus faecalis collected from freshwater environments
were compared with these enteric strains of E. faecalis. Weigand
et al. (2014) identiﬁed putative habitat-speciﬁc strains of enterococci where the environmental and enteric strains could not be
differentiated by traditional phenotypic tests or by genetic tests using DNA-DNA hybridization or 16S rDNA sequencing. Pathogenicity islands (PAI), however, were identiﬁed as a common feature
in the genome of enteric enterococci but not environmental isolates. PAI contain sequences which allow insertion/deletion into
chromosomes and thus horizontal gene transfer between bacterial genomes, and PAI are known to encode virulence genes and
aid host colonization (Mecsas and Strauss, 1996). Genomic evidence presented by Weigand et al. (2014) suggests that the extraenteric strains may predate the enteric strains, meaning that enterococci originated as environmental strains. These environmental strains then adapted to an enteric environment by acquisition
of accessory metabolic functions, for example, via pathogenicity is-

9

lands. This work is supported by Lebreton et al. (2017) who used
molecular clock estimations in conjunction with phenotypic and
environmental characterization to investigate the ancestral linkages of enterococci (Starling, 2017). They identiﬁed that enterococci were potentially associated with sediments in marine habitats prior to the association of enterococci with land animal hosts.
Lebreton et al. (2017) suggested that carbohydrate uptake and utilization genes have been major drivers in the differentiation of the
Enterococcus into diverse species as they adapted to the unique
intestinal environments of a particular land animal host. Properties that facilitate the importance of enterococci as signiﬁcant
multidrug resistant pathogens in hospital acquired infections include their ability to acquire mobile elements, and innate resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants due to a hardened cell wall.
Lebreton et al. (2017) postulated that the enterococci’s hardened
cell wall was a product of natural selection within the marine environment in response to environmental stresses and enabled them
to adapt to the transition from marine to terrestrial animals where
gut microﬂora encountered cycles of starvation and desiccation,
post-excretion, before re-entering the terrestrial animal food chain.
Another study exploring the genetic differences between the
enteric and environmental enterococci noted that virulence and
antibiotic resistance genes were more commonly identiﬁed in enterococci derived from clinical settings compared with strains isolated from marine sediments (Di Cesare et al., 2014). In particular, the virulence gene esp important in host colonization and
bioﬁlm formation (Fisher and Phillips, 2009) was only identiﬁed
in clinical isolates. The nickel uptake operon was, however, identiﬁed as a potential biomarker for environmental enterococci because of its almost exclusive presence in environmental enterococci (Di Cesare et al., 2014). It was suggested that deletion of
this operon in the enteric environment may not be disadvantageous, because nickel is present in much higher concentrations
in the intestine compared with freshwater environments. Di Cesare et al. (2014) also identiﬁed a gene in the enterococci isolated
from marine sediments, which conferred resistance to copper, and
suggested its presence may be related to industrial pollution outputs in the Adriatic Sea environment.
The ﬁeld of comparative genomics between enterococci isolated from clinical and non-clinical environments has continued to
reveal insights into differences in genetic adaptations (He et al.,
2018). In a study of 78 genomes of Enterococcus faecalis, which
included isolates from water and enteric strains, the water isolates had the lowest predicted open reading frame size and smallest genome sizes, whereas there were no signiﬁcant differences
between enteric strains from blood, feces and urine (He et al.,
2018). This study identiﬁed 84 genes that were speciﬁc to the water isolates; 28 of those genes were present in all water isolates,
including the genes involved in the cobalt, and the nickel transport system supporting the ﬁnding of Di Cesare et al. (2014) that
the nickel uptake operon could be a target for the identiﬁcation
of environmental enterococci. The number of antibiotic resistance
genes in enterococci isolated from blood were signiﬁcantly higher
compared with those from water or dairy products. Furthermore,
a high number of environment-speciﬁc genes were identiﬁed that
did not have a known cellular function. Genomic studies are ﬁnding that the natural habitat from which the enterococci are isolated contributes to shaping the genome of the bacterium, allowing it to adapt to its environment (He et al., 2018; Zhong et al.,
2019). Future studies may allow for genetic methods to speciﬁcally
target environmentally-adapted enterococci and discriminate them
from the enteric enterococci. This would signiﬁcantly enhance water quality monitoring enabling targeting of enterococci derived
from fecal contamination sources rather than the free-living enterococci.

3. Environmental reservoirs of FIB
Many reviews have documented that the fecal indicators E. coli and enterococci can occur in the absence
of fresh fecal inputs, as part of the microbiota in sediments, soil and sand, terrestrial and aquatic plants, and
algal mats (Byappanahalli et al., 2012a; Jang et al., 2017;
Nevers et al., 2014; Teixeira et al., 2020; Whitman et al., 2014)
(Tables 1 and 4). Although these FIB are sourced from historical
fecal inputs, these environmental reservoirs can also be important
sources of environmentally-persistent pathogens in recreational
areas with potential for human health impacts (Mackowiak et al.,
2018; Sabino et al., 2014; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2016; Weiskerger and
Brandão, 2020; Weiskerger et al., 2019).
Genotypic and phenotypic studies in various climates have
shown that populations of E. coli and enterococci isolated from
soils and sand cluster by geographic location into distinct but diverse groups. Such clustering, especially at the genotypic level,
suggests that FIB in the natural environment come from multiple
sources, but have suﬃciently diverged from animal and bird fecal
sources in the same geographical location for the FIB to no longer
be considered of recent fecal origin (Byappanahalli et al., 2012c;
Fujioka and Byappanahalli, 2001; Ishii et al., 2006a; PerchecMerien and Lewis, 2013). Furthermore, genetic typing studies have
identiﬁed where the E. coli populations in environmental reservoirs
such as sediment provided evidence of clonal populations and thus
environmental replication (Ibekwe et al., 2011; Ksoll et al., 2007).
This has led to the term “naturalized” or “environmental” enteric
FIB populations, which are capable of persistence and/or replication in the post-defecation environment (Perchec-Merien and
Lewis, 2013; Staley et al., 2014; Whitman et al., 2014). Therefore,
identiﬁcation of FIB that indicate fresh sources of fecal inputs with
concomitant high probability of pathogen presence,requires the
understanding of the science related to survival and persistence of
inputs of FIB from aged fecal sources. Many of the studies that follow, discuss enterococci and E. coli persistence in the environment
without differentiating either between FIB as derived from aged fecal sources or the non-fecal (non-enteric) sources of FIB. Future

studies will be able to incorporate the genetic tools identiﬁed in
this review to differentiate the FIB populations in these habitats to
explore their derivation and relevance to health risk assessments.
3.1. FIB in soil and sediments
Many rivers, particularly those in catchments prone to erosion,
have the potential to store enteric indicators and pathogens in
their sediments with concomitant public health impacts if sediment resuspension events occur (Abia et al., 2017; Abia et al., 2016;
Devane et al., 2019; Drummond et al., 2015). Enteric pathogens and
E. coli were evaluated for survival in sediment microcosm experiments in ﬂow chambers to simulate their survival in riverbeds
(Abia et al., 2016). The researchers concluded that river sediments
can provide a favorable environment for both enteric pathogens
and indicators depending on temperature parameters. E. coli and
Salmonella sp. were noted to survive longer at 4 °C, whereas Vibrio cholerae had the greatest persistence of all tested microbes at
20 °C and 30 °C in sediment (Abia et al., 2016).
Growth and persistence of FIB was observed in sediment microcosms obtained from a Swiss freshwater lake (Pote et al., 2009).
Low temperatures (10 °C) and low organic matter content in the
sediment negatively impacted FIB concentrations. Intact sediment
cores collected from a Swiss freshwater lake contained FIB levels
ranging between 105 and 107 colony forming units (CFU)/100 g dry
weight (Haller et al., 2009). The cores were stored at 4 °C for 90
days and persistence of E. coli and enterococci up to 90 days in
the top surface layer (2 cm depth) was noted at concentrations between 104 and 105 CFU/100 g dry sediment.
Mesocosm experiments using sediment and water collected
from a river system in Florida revealed growth of enterococci and
E. coli under conditions of simulated tidal inﬂuence with wetting
and drying phases (Desmarais et al., 2002). In Hawaiian soils, soil
moisture, nutrient conditions and indigenous soil bacteria were
identiﬁed by Byappanahalli and Fujioka (2004) as limiting factors
inﬂuencing the growth of E. coli, but to a lesser extent enterococci. In this tropical environment, they still observed slow and
sporadic replication of FIB, which allowed FIB to establish as a mi-

nor fraction of the soil microbiota. Other studies have conﬁrmed
the importance of higher levels of organic matter (≥1.0%) and ﬁne
sediment (silt and clay) for facilitating the survival of FIB in sediment and soil (Brinkmeyer et al., 2015; Desmarais et al., 2002;
Garzio-Hadzick et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2006; Stocker et al., 2018).
Liang et al. (2016) identiﬁed that the surface properties of E. coli
isolated from stream sediments were different to the E. coli isolated from stream water, and that differences in habitat had a regulating effect on the expression of surface properties such as hydrophobicity and the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The hydrophobicity of stream sediment E. coli was
noted to be signiﬁcantly higher. These changes in EPS content may
be advantageous for persistence of the E. coli cells by aiding cell
adhesion and bioﬁlm formation in the stream sediments.
One of the ﬁrst studies to investigate whether there are any
habitat preferences between phylogroups of E. coli used single nucleotide polymorphism qPCR to differentiate the four phylogroups
of E. coli (B1, B2, D and E) (Dusek et al., 2018). These researchers
studied E. coli prevalence in soil under different land use types in
the U.S. to determine if soil and landscape characteristics impacted
phylogroup survival and distribution. A high prevalence of E. coli
was identiﬁed in both forest soils and pastureland, however core
genome analysis of isolates did not identify any cryptic clades of
Escherichia. The phylogroup, B1, was the dominant E. coli identiﬁed in soils. Phylogroups B1 and E were more commonly associated with pasturelands, while phylogroups B2 and D had a greater
association with wooded areas and more acidic soils (Dusek et al.,
2018).
Pathogenic Salmonella species have been identiﬁed as surviving
in estuarine bank sediments with comparable persistence to E. coli
suggesting that E. coli could be a useful indicator of the survival
of this pathogen in estuary environments (Siddiqee et al., 2018).
Pathogen survival was investigated in fresh and stored (one year)
sediments from storage tanks of storm-water treatment plants to
ascertain the risk to human health from redistributing the sediment to land (Sałata et al., 2018). Some fresh sediments from
the storm-water treatment plants did contain pathogens, including
Salmonella and fecal enterococci, highlighting a potential hazard
if they were applied to agricultural land. In contrast, stored sediments were not identiﬁed as containing the above pathogens or
E. coli or Shigella. The authors suggest that with increasing quantities of sediment from storm-water facilities, there is a need for
guidelines on the levels of microbes that may represent a biological hazard if such sediments are applied directly to land.
With the recognition of the persistence in sediments and soils
of fecal microbes derived from anthropogenic pollutants, investigations of environmental reservoirs are now focusing on the persistence and prevalence of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes
in waterways and their correlation with FIB (Barron et al., 2018;
Brown et al., 2019; Devane et al., 2014; Vignaroli et al., 2018). The
impact of FIB in sediments and soils and their correlation with
pathogen presence warrants further investigations to facilitate recommendations for water scientists on the management of these
environmental reservoirs.
3.2. FIB in beach sands
Wave activity and the resuspension of beach sands may affect
FIB levels (Weiskerger et al., 2019). In a study of Californian marine beach sands, Lee et al. (2006) observed levels of enterococci
at >104 MPN/100 g wet sediment in enclosed beaches where the
intensity of wave activity was low. This level of enterococci in sediment was two to three orders of magnitude higher than levels at
eleven open beaches, where the authors postulate that wave activity led to increases in resuspension and transportation of enterococci seaward. In contrast, the relationship between E. coli con-

11

centrations in sediment was less clear when comparing open and
enclosed beaches, as levels of E. coli in sediment were similar at
both beach types.
An extreme weather event in Portugal in 2010, resulted in ﬂash
ﬂoods and mudslides, which caused severe impacts including to
recreational beaches in the Archipelago of Madeira. Levels of E. coli
and enterococci in beach sand at eight of these beaches in the
Madeira Archipelago were increased with higher concentrations for
enterococci compared with E. coli over the three months following the storm (Abreu et al., 2016; Romão et al., 2017). In subsequent months removal of debris and the repair of damaged infrastructure such as sewer lines were important actions for reducing the microbial contaminant load (FIB, mycelial fungi and yeast)
at these beaches. It was observed, however, that artiﬁcial beaches
had higher levels of microbial contaminants compared with natural beaches, and this was not correlated to the type of beach
sand at these localities. Rather, it was postulated that hard protection surfaces built to reduce erosion of sand at artiﬁcial beaches
had the effect of disrupting the natural cleansing processes such
as wave action. The authors suggest that these artiﬁcial beaches
require a different management approach to natural beaches to
reduce health risks from microbial contaminants in sand and
water.
In microcosm experiments it was observed that the presence
of (autoclaved) beach sediment enhanced the levels of E. coli in
the water column by two to three orders of magnitude (Lee et al.,
2006). In comparison, in those microcosms that lacked sediment,
the E. coli levels in the water decreased by three orders of magnitude over the ﬁrst two days. Similar to the soil/sediment studies
in the previous section, the researchers postulated that higher organic matter content in sediments and the formation of bioﬁlms in
the presence of beach sediments were factors that contributed to
the persistence of FIB populations in the water column (Lee et al.,
2006). In other studies, where predators in sediment/sand microcosms were not inactivated, the FIB were noted to persist rather
than grow (Craig et al., 2004; Hartz et al., 2008). Lack of growth
was attributed to the presence of predators restricting FIB numbers and competition with indigenous bacteria for limited nutrient
resources.
An initial increase in E. coli concentration within the ﬁrst 24 h,
was observed in sandplots inoculated with E. coli cells (107 /100 g
sand) (Beversdorf et al., 2007). This initial observation of E. coli
growth has been reported in marine and freshwater mesocosms
inoculated with sewage (Gilpin et al., 2013) and in-ﬁeld survival experiments with wildfowl and cattle feces (Moriarty et al.,
2012; Sinton et al., 2007). The sandplots exposed to environmental conditions with ﬂuctuating temperatures (23–32 °C) showed
the highest E. coli cell increases of 100–fold and maintained cell
numbers up to 6 days, before a gradual decrease in cell density (Beversdorf et al., 2007). The temperature-controlled sandplots
showed up to a twenty-fold increase of E. coli with the greatest increase seen at ambient temperature (23–25 °C), followed by 4 °C
and 37 °C and then 44.5 °C. No E. coli were recovered from sandplots held at either 50 °C or 55 °C. After initial increases, the cell
densities from sandplots of ambient, 4 °C and 37 °C remained stable up to 2 days before die-off. Compared with lower temperatures,
the fastest rates of cell density decline were seen at temperatures
of 37 °C and 44.5 °C.
Multiple E. coli and enterococci virulence genes including
Shiga toxin genes and antibiotic resistant genes have been identiﬁed in marine sediments in the Mediterranean Sea. Potentially
pathogenic bacteria carrying these virulence genes have been identiﬁed in the sediments of recreational beaches where the overlying seawater complied with recreational water quality guidelines
(Di Cesare et al. 2014; Luna et al., 2010; Vignaroli et al., 2013;
Vignaroli et al., 2012; Vignaroli et al., 2018). Characterization of E.

coli isolated from Venus clams growing in natural beds within the
Mediterranean Sea found that the majority of isolates belonged to
the phylogroups A and B1, and one third were resistant to at least
one antibiotic, with 11% being multidrug resistant (Vignaroli et al.,
2016). The prevalence of cryptic clades isolated from clams was 8%,
with nine of the eleven cryptic clade isolates belonging to Clade V,
and one isolate each belonging to Clade III and IV (Vignaroli et al.,
2016).
Based on concerns about the health risk associated with aquatic
sediments/sands, researchers have recommended including sediment environments in sampling strategies when monitoring water quality. International experts convened a workshop to discuss
the issues relating to the microbial quality of beach sands and its
relationship to public health, with a view to developing the standards for the routine evaluation of sand at coastal sites of recreational signiﬁcance (Sabino et al., 2014; Vogel et al., 2017). Recommendations included that beach sand should be screened for a
variety of pathogens known to impact human health, and monitoring of sand microbial quality should occur in conjunction with
routine water monitoring (Abreu et al., 2016; Fujioka et al., 2015;
Romão et al., 2017; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2016). The reviews of
Weiskerger et al. (2019) and Weiskerger and Brandão (2020) discuss FIB, fungi and other pathogens, and the role of beach sands
in transmission of these pathogens to the general public including the potential resuspension of pathogens into the water column.
These reviews highlight concerns associated with increased concentrations of pathogens entrained from sediments into the water column due to the effects of climate change such as intensiﬁed
wave action, and higher temperatures facilitating microbial growth.
These effects could lead to increased health risks for recreational
bathers exposed to pathogens resuspended from beach sands, supporting the call for monitoring the microbial quality of both water and sand at recreational locations and establishing protocols for
quantitative microbial risk assessments (Weiskerger et al., 2019).
3.3. FIB in the water column and wastewater
The understanding that aquatic environments are impacted
by FIB derived from multiple sources including environmentallyadapted/naturalized FIB has led to better decision making around
mitigation strategies and the research required to focus on the best
management practices including differentiation of FIB strains in
environmental samples.
The E. coli budget, representing the input of E. coli, loss and persistence was explored in Lake Michigan using 70 0 0 E. coli observations collected between 20 0 0 and 2014 (Weiskerger and Whitman, 2018). This long-term dataset afforded the researchers the
ability to investigate E. coli trends and postulate reasons for decreases in E. coli concentrations over time by unraveling a complex
and multivariate process. They discuss the impacts of wastewater
and beach management practices, bird control measures, hydrometeorological and climate changes, and the introduction of invasive
quagga mussels to the lake system. Their main conclusion was that
reductions in water clarity due in part to the high densities of the
quagga mussels had the greatest impact allowing for sunlight inactivation of E. coli leading to reductions in E. coli water populations.
In Australia, E. coli blooms (>10,0 0 0 CFU/10 0 mL) have been
attributed to E. coli strains assigned to phylogroups A and B1,
with these clonal strains isolated across multiple southeastern Australian waterbodies (Power et al., 2005). A week prior to the formation of these E. coli blooms, the coliform counts in lake water
were less than 150 cells/100 mL. These particular bloom strains
of E. coli were not among the 435 E. coli isolated from the feces
of vertebrates collected from throughout Australia (Power et al.,
2005). Blooms of a clonal E. coli B1 strain have been observed in
Australian waterbodies up to three times a year, as reported in

the review of Gordon (2013). Characterization of the genome of
the E. coli phylotype B1 bloom strain suggested it was closely related to Shigella strains rather than typical E. coli, but that it lacked
most of the virulence traits associated with Shigella (Gordon, 2013).
Gordon (2013) and Power et al. (2005) suggested these bloom
strains may represent free-living E. coli strains that are disconnected from fecal inputs. Such strains have adapted to the nonintestinal environment through expression of survival traits such as
capsules, which facilitate evasion of predators and protection from
desiccation and sunlight inactivation (Power et al., 2005).
A whole genome meta-analysis was undertaken of E. coli isolates (n = 1294) collected from a variety of environmental (avian
fecal and meat, non-human mammalian feces) and human sources
from diverse locations within Australia (Touchon et al., 2020). The
E. coli included freshwater isolates (n = 285) from the study of
Power et al. (2005) and revealed insights into the marked genetic
differences between the freshwater E. coli strains and those from
other habitats. Overall, the freshwater E. coli isolates had smaller
genome sizes compared with the isolates from other habitats. Although these freshwater genomes of E. coli isolates carried the
lowest number of mobile genetic elements and lacked plasmids,
the isolates were identiﬁed as having a high level of acquisition
and loss of genes. The authors suggest that these genomic differences were driven by adaptations to the non-enteric environment,
which included the carriage of a low number of virulence traits
and antibiotic resistance genes. Conversely, a high number of gene
families associated with capsule biosynthesis were identiﬁed in the
water isolates, which the authors hypothesized were an important
adaptation to the aquatic environment (Touchon et al., 2020). The
authors concluded that there was strong evidence to suggest that
the evolution of E. coli is shaped by horizontal gene transfer resulting in adaptations to its niche environments.
The identiﬁcation of environmentally-adapted E. coli strains in
canal water suggested that environmental conditions were promoting the survival and proliferation of certain E. coli strains in the
canals (Jokinen et al., 2019; Tymensen et al., 2015). E. coli isolates from surface water and sediment were differentiated from
fecal E. coli isolates based on phylotyping by the Clermont PCR
(Clermont et al., 2013) and comparative accessory gene ﬁngerprinting (Jokinen et al., 2019; Tymensen et al., 2015). In addition, C.
lari was the Campylobacter most commonly isolated from irrigation
water compared with animal feces or sediment, whereas when the
human pathogen, C. jejuni was identiﬁed in canal water it was in
association with E. coli exceedances, high rainfall and land runoff
from surrounding agricultural land (Jokinen et al., 2019). E. coli belonging to phylogroup B1 were the dominant isolates identiﬁed in
reservoir water and canals in both studies (Jokinen et al., 2019;
Tymensen et al., 2015). The study of Tymensen et al. (2015) found
that there was no single gene that was able to differentiate the
fresh fecal E. coli B1 isolates from the environmental B1 isolates.
Initial PCR assays targeted 14 accessory genes, but none of those
targets were speciﬁc to a particular ecotype. Six of the 14 gene targets, however, were enriched for either the fecal or environmental
ecotypes (sediment and water), and therefore these six genes were
assayed to develop binary (presence/absence of each gene) ﬁngerprints that differentiated the E. coli isolates into ecotype-speciﬁc
groups and ecotype-enriched groups (where >75% of isolates belonged to either the fecal or environmental ecotypes). Some of
these six genes encoded toxin-antitoxin genes which are strongly
associated with fecal E. coli isolates, whereas other genes encoded
for iron acquisition and bioﬁlm formation, traits which are thought
to convey an advantage for environmentally-adapted E. coli strains
(Tymensen et al., 2015). This type of study shows that a clear
delineation between fecal and environmental ecotypes of E. coli
phylogroups will be challenging even with sophisticated genetic
tools.

FIB play an important role in the detection of potential fecal
contamination events in drinking water sources. Genotypic characterization was undertaken of 28 E. coli isolated from chlorinated drinking water distribution plants in Australia to identify
the source of the isolates and the potential risk to public health
(Blyton and Gordon, 2017). The investigation included characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistant determinants
associated with each isolate, and based on these criteria, four of
the 28 isolates were deemed to be potential pathogens. Nine of
the E. coli isolates were characterized as belonging to what the researchers termed “free-living” E. coli with multiple isolates identiﬁed on the same day within the same water distribution network. Six of these “free-living” isolates were typed as belonging
to a commensal E. coli phylogroup, which had previously been isolated from E. coli blooms in Australia. The authors noted that these
“free-living” E. coli would be unlikely to pose a human health risk.
The remainder of the drinking water isolates belonged to E. coli
phylogroups B1, B2, D and Clade I, however, no other members of
the cryptic clades of Escherichia were identiﬁed. In an Indian study,
a strain of E. coli was isolated from arsenic-contaminated groundwater (Mohapatra and Sar, 2018). Genomic sequencing revealed a
genetic repertoire that enabled this bacterium to survive in the
oligotrophic conditions of the groundwater and develop resistance
to high concentrations of arsenic and iron found in the arsenic-rich
groundwaters of India and Bangladesh.
Studies of the persistence of FIB through the wastewater
treatment process have identiﬁed resilient FIB populations. The
growth of enterococci in oxidation ponds (up to 180,0 0 0/10 0 ml)
was identiﬁed at a wastewater treatment plant in New Zealand
(Moriarty et al., 2008). Antibiotic resistance analysis and genetic
subtyping of isolates showed very low population diversity in comparison to the high diversity of Enterococcus screened from the
wastewater inﬂuent and feces from wildfowl residing around the
ponds. The authors concluded that the highly clonal nature of
these Enterococcus pond isolates suggested replication of an environmental source of enterococci rather than breakthrough from
the wastewater or avian inputs. On the basis of these ﬁndings the
municipal authority was able to remove enterococci concentrations
from their discharge conditions, and focus on E. coli monitoring to
ascertain elevated health risks (Moriarty et al., 2008).
A Canadian wastewater study revealed evidence of stresstolerant, chlorine-resistant strains of E. coli persisting through the
municipal wastewater treatment process (Zhi et al., 2016). Isolates
belonged to E. coli phylogroup A and carried genes that increased
survivability. The authors developed a PCR targeting unique genetic
elements in these wastewater-speciﬁc E. coli (Table 2), and this
PCR was negative in the feces of animal hosts. Further investigation of these strains of E. coli using whole genome phylogenetic
analysis and including similar strains from wastewater in the US
and Switzerland revealed that these wastewater strains formed a
separate clade to the enteric phylogroups (A-F) of E. coli, and to
the Cryptic Clades II-V (Zhi et al., 2019). Interestingly, their genetic
repertoire spanned that of both the enteric and cryptic clades, in
that they shared some biochemical characteristics of the enteric E.
coli but also had biochemical proﬁles that are found in the cryptic
clades such as bioﬁlm adhesion. Many of the antibiotic resistance
genes identiﬁed in the wastewater strains were also represented in
the cryptic clade strains including genes for eﬄux pumps, which
are important in the transport of other hydrophilic molecules besides antibiotics and may confer an advantage in non-host environments.
In a United States catchment with mixed land use (including
urban, agriculture, forest, rural septic tanks), the prevalence of E.
coli phylogroups in surface waters was shown to be dominated by
phylogroups B1 (31%) and B2 (32%) (Cho et al., 2018). There was a
low level of antimicrobial resistance detected in the isolates (7%).

13

Of the 496 E. coli isolates tested, 20 belonged to pathogenic E.
coli with the majority being enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) but
none of these 20 isolates carried antimicrobial resistance genes.
The isolation from waterways of E. coli carrying virulence genes,
even when identiﬁed at low levels, raises concerns about the potential for horizontal gene transfer of virulence traits between bacteria (Cho et al., 2018; Davison 1999).
Wetlands have been advocated in urban and rural settings
as natural bioﬁlters for the removal of microbial and nutrient
pollutants from point source and diffuse land runoff sources
(Almuktar et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2017; Kaushal et al., 2018;
Kipasika et al., 2014). FIB have traditionally been employed,
with varying degrees of success, as surrogates to determine
the eﬃciency of pathogen reductions in the water discharged
(McMinn et al., 2019; Rusinol et al., 2020). In a study of an urban constructed wetland, Vivant et al. (2016) discussed the design
of the wetland and maximizing those physical and biological characteristics that contribute to pathogen/indicator reductions, for example by UV irradiation, and the effects of minimizing the impacts
of wildlife and seasonal increases in temperature which contribute
to microbial growth/persistence. The authors also noted a decrease
in both concentration and diversity of antibiotic resistant E. coli as
they passaged through the urban wetland suggesting that this wetland design limited the dissemination into surface waters of bla
genes associated with the antibiotic resistant E. coli (Vivant et al.,
2016).
A common theme in many recent wetland publications is the
role played by animal fecal deposition (particularly avian species)
as a source of both FIB and/or pathogens as water travels through
a wetland (Hsu et al., 2017). In a constructed wetland to treat
stormwater discharge, Meng et al. (2018) noted that E. coli was
a poor indicator of reductions in the pathogen Campylobacter and
proposed that direct fecal defecation by waterfowl was a source
of the discrepancies between bacterial concentrations in the wetland inputs versus the outﬂows. McMinn et al. (2019) investigated
the effect of wetland treatment on FIB concentrations and noted
similar concentrations of FIB throughout all treatment stages of
the constructed wetland. Human fecal source markers identiﬁed in
the early stages of the wetland treatment were signiﬁcantly higher
than in the latter stages, whilst avian fecal signatures and Campylobacter were detected at higher levels in the latter stages of wetland treatment, consistent with observed bird activity and postulated fecal inputs. The authors suggested that fecal source markers
provided more sensitive information on the eﬃcacy of wetlands
as treatment centers compared with relying on FIB as indicators
of fecal contamination. Another wetland study also identiﬁed impacts from avian species in relation to antibiotic resistant E. coli
isolated from wetland water, and from avian feces collected in the
vicinity of the wetland (Sen et al., 2019). Overall, there was similar antibiotic resistance observed in avian fecal and water isolates
to 12 of the 13 antibiotics tested. Statistically similar prevalences
of individual E. coli phylogroups were identiﬁed in fecal and water matrices. The water and fecal samples were dominated by the
B1 phylogroup at 39% and 37%, respectively, followed by the B2
phylogroup at 13% and 21%, respectively. In addition, 5% of water
samples and 9% of avian fecal samples carried isolates belonging
to the Escherichia Clades III, IV and V.
The impact of an isolate’s origins was studied by
Berthe et al. (2013) to understand the ability of Escherichia to
survive when released into the water. Strains were isolated from
water bodies, human feces and bovine feces and subjected to
different survival conditions in microcosm water experiments. In
general, E. coli isolates from recent fecal events rapidly lost their
culturability in <2 days, and most of these were multi-resistant
to antibiotics and harbored several virulence factors. In contrast,
persistent strains able to survive from 4 to 14 days were more



14

often found in water with low levels of fecal contamination and
belonged mainly to the B1 phylogroup. These persistent strains
were susceptible to the 17 antibiotics tested, often harbored only
one virulence factor, and were able to grow at temperatures as
low as 7 °C. In comparison, the B2 strains and the Clade V strains
were shown to lose their culturability more rapidly (<2 days)
after release into water. Overall, those E. coli strains that harbored
only one virulence factor were identiﬁed as better survivors suggesting that survival is enhanced by reducing energy expended
on maintaining virulence traits. Consistent with the above study,
was the ﬁnding that B1 was the dominant E. coli identiﬁed in
canals used for the irrigation of food crops (Jokinen et al., 2019;
Tymensen et al., 2015). These studies illustrate that some E. coli
strains derived from fecal inputs have a genomic repertoire that
enhances their survival in a non-host environment.
The studies above are examples of how traditonal monitoring of
FIB is expanding to include a more robust analysis of the E. coli and
enterococci subpopulations in the water. Improvements in the interpretation of FIB concentrations in relation to water quality leads
to the focusing of resources on to those pollution inputs that contribute to a public health risk.
3.4. Partitioning of FIB between the underlying substrate and the
water column
The water management impacts of sediment resuspension in
beaches and in river systems are discussed in relation to FIB levels in the water, which are potentially derived from the underlying
sediment substrate.
A comprehensive spring-summer survey of E. coli concentrations at a freshwater lake beach detected mean counts of E.
coli/100 mL that were consistently higher in foreshore sand (104 )
than submerged sand (103 ) and water (102 ) (Whitman and Nevers, 2003). A disconnect between E. coli counts in water between
consecutive days was noted, calling into question the reliance on
FIB results collected on day one, in determining beach closures for
day two. In addition, the practice of replacing foreshore sand each
year for the swimming season led to a rapid re-colonization of E.
coli concentrations in the imported sand. A synchronous trend of
increasing and decreasing E. coli counts in the water and sand was
observed over the bathing seasons, with a gradual increase in E.
coli concentrations in both matrices. The authors attributed this
slow increase to physical parameters such as the seasonal rise in
air and water temperatures. For this locality, the authors provided
evidence that the water was not concentrating E. coli to the sand.
This evidence included the higher concentrations in sand compared with water, and the steady temporal equilibrium between
counts in water and sand. This seminal study concluded that beach
sand has an important role to play in FIB levels in water, and that
the sand rather than acting as a sink for E. coli, was in fact acting
as a source of E. coli for the water column above.
Subsequent studies have used genetic analyses of bacterial communities to ascertain the contributions of sediment FIB reservoirs
to the water column. Rothenheber and Jones (2018) carried out an
assessment of enterococci concentrations and fecal sources impacting a watershed that encompassed freshwater, estuary and marine
beach sites. Results of bacterial community analyses by metagenomic sequencing indicated that there was a high level of mixing
between sediment and the overlying freshwater, as 74% of the bacterial communities identiﬁed in the freshwater were also identiﬁed in the underlying sediments. In addition, elevated concentrations of enterococci in water were inﬂuenced by the type of fecal
source input, hydrological conditions and environmental sources,
suggesting that freshwater sediment reservoirs of enterococci were
contributing to enterococci levels identiﬁed in freshwater. Readers are referred to the review of Weiskerger et al. (2019) for a

more comprehensive overview of studies of resuspension of FIB
and pathogens at beach sites and the physical factors (including
sand composition, wind and wave action, and rainfall) and biological mechanisms (such as bioﬁlm formation in sand) that contribute
to transport of FIB within the beach environment.
In river systems, the transport of microbes between the sediment and water column may be a dynamic process that occurs during base river ﬂows as well as during high ﬂow events
(Drummond et al., 2015; Jeon et al., 2020; Litton et al., 2010;
Stocker et al., 2016; Yakirevich et al., 2013). It has been hypothesized that continual entrainment of microbes into the water column is due to exchange of water across the sedimentwater interface in the area beneath and alongside a river bed, in
the regions where there is mixing of shallow groundwater and
surface water (Grant et al., 2011). The scouring effect of these
sediment resuspension events have been shown to occur from
the top <2 cm depth of the sediment surface with the concentration of E. coli decreasing by an order of magnitude between one and three centimetres depth from the top of the sediment (Smith et al., 2019; Yakirevich et al., 2013). Under base
ﬂow conditions, Pachepsky et al. (2017) recorded net release
rates from sediments of up to 57 and 87 cells /m2 /s for E. coli
and enterococci, respectively. The net release rates reported by
Pachepsky et al. (2017) were used by Jeon et al. (2020) to estimate eﬄux levels of E. coli of 86 CFU/100 mL, which accounted
for the observed increases in the water column noted during baseﬂow periods in their study of a predominantly agricultural zone in
a Pennsylvanian creek.
Investigation of E. coli concentrations and populations in
streambeds has increased the understanding of their impacts on
sampling strategies during baseﬂow and storm ﬂow conditions
(Piorkowski et al., 2014b; Stocker et al., 2018). Spatial variability in
sediment with hot spots of high E. coli concentration were noted
along a creek bed (500 m monitoring length) (Stocker et al., 2018).
During high ﬂow experiments, these hot spots led to an increase
in the average E. coli sediment levels for the stream reach, even
when most locations were recording a decrease in E. coli sediment
levels. In another stream study, DNA ﬁngerprinting of E. coli populations revealed that high velocity features in a stream such as rifﬂes and runs had different populations of E. coli strains compared
with areas of deposition such as pools (Piorkowski et al., 2014b).
Comparing the DNA ﬁngerprint proﬁles of E. coli in sediment
and downstream water samples, Brinkmeyer et al. (2015) identiﬁed that 36% of E. coli water isolates had similar DNA proﬁles to
the upstream sediment E. coli. This contribution from upstream
sources of E. coli and the identiﬁed heterogeneity of sediment E.
coli levels has led to a call for further characterization of these
E. coli hotspots and their inﬂuence on stream reach loads of E.
coli (Piorkowski et al., 2014b; Stocker et al., 2018). Furthermore,
Piorkowski et al. (2014b) advised that characterizing the population of E. coli isolates requires up to 120 isolates per streambed
feature to capture the inherent high diversity of E. coli strains.
An amplicon sequencing method which targets the highly recombinant prone gnd (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) gene has
shown the ability to resolve the high diversity associated with E.
coli strains and could be a useful tool for future studies to investigate environmental reservoirs of E. coli without the requirement
for colony isolation (Cookson et al., 2017).
During baseﬂow, effective particle sediment size and water velocity were the most important parameters impacting on E. coli
entrainment into the water column (Piorkowski et al., 2014b). In
comparison, during storm ﬂow, organic carbon in the sediment
and the median particle diameter of the sediment were also important variables for explaining E. coli resuspension. Many studies
have identiﬁed that survival and retention (reduced hyporheic exchange) of FIB in sediment has been associated with ﬁner grain

sediments, higher nutrient and organic matter content in the sediment and lower interstitial water content (which decreased E. coli
eﬄux into the water) (Brinkmeyer et al., 2015; Haller et al., 2009;
Jamieson et al., 2005; Korajkic et al., 2019; Stocker et al., 2018).
Another study investigating the sources of elevated E. coli in an
urban environment in Lincoln, Nebraska in the U.S., attempted to
quantify the contribution of environmental sources to the bacterial community of an urban stream under dry and wet weather
conditions (Baral et al., 2018). The bacterial community was identiﬁed using a 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomic approach on water and sediment samples collected from the urban stream, and
water from an upstream lake, urban soils and street sweepings,
sanitary sewage, and local animal and bird fecal samples. Using
SourceTracker bioinformatic analysis, the main sources of the microbial community identiﬁed in the urban stream were aligned to
the upstream lake during dry weather, and the wash-off from urban streets into storm-water during wet conditions. During dry
weather conditions, the streambed sediment was not identiﬁed
as a signiﬁcant source of microbes resuspended into the stream
(Baral et al., 2018).
Evaluation of E. coli populations in a temperate stream by DNA
ﬁngerprinting techniques revealed a wide diversity of E. coli strains
with water populations showing greater diversity compared with
sediments (Chandrasekaran et al., 2015). There was, however, substantial overlap between strains in water and sediments. Over the
two-year study, the E. coli strains displayed annual shifts in their
populations, although some strains, particularly in sediment, were
identiﬁed throughout the study. This study and another in a temperate climate, have noted that E. coli levels in sediments were
higher in autumn compared with spring, even though sediment
temperatures were similar (Chandrasekaran et al., 2015; Ishii et al.,
2007). Similar ﬁndings of higher FIB concentrations in sediment
during summer compared with winter conditions were identiﬁed
in another creek study (Table 4) (Stocker et al., 2019). The higher
concentrations were attributed to E. coli populations persisting and
accumulating over summer months and becoming a stable part
of the sediment microbiota. Chandrasekaran et al. (2015) found
the mixing of strains between water and sediment, and at different sites along the watercourse, supported the ﬁndings of other
studies which had shown that overland runoff and rainfall (high
ﬂow events) inﬂuenced the transport and distribution of E. coli
(Ishii et al., 2006a; Piorkowski et al., 2014a; Solo-Gabriele et al.,
20 0 0). These researchers highlighted how these factors impact the
concentrations observed during monitoring of E. coli in the water
column (Chandrasekaran et al., 2015). The studies cited above did
not include the differentiation of E. coli phylogroups from the Escherichia cryptic clades but Chandrasekaran et al. (2015) described
the need to develop genetic methods that target E. coli from fecal
sources (and negate contributions from naturalized Escherichia) to
improve assessments of water quality.
E. coli concentrations in agricultural irrigation ponds recorded
temporally stable spatial patterns in the water at different locations within the pond, and higher concentrations and prevalence in the interior pond sediments compared with the bank
sediments (Table 4) (Pachepsky et al., 2018). In this study it was
noted that persistence of E. coli in the sediments and the high
spatial variability noted in the water highlighted the requirement
for careful assessments of where to take samples when monitoring the water quality prior to application of irrigation water to
land.
From the studies discussed above, it is apparent that multiple
factors affect the decline or persistence of FIB once discharged to
the aquatic environment, and it is likely that the impact of each of
these factors will be dependent on the water type and natural environment of the receiving water (Wanjugi and Harwood, 2013). It
appears clear, however, that sediments/sands from beaches, lakes,

15

rivers, and even irrigation ponds are likely to provide a reservoir
for FIB, which are available for resuspension to the water column
during disturbance events such as high rainfall. In addition, there
is growing evidence that entrainment into the water column from
sediments can occur under baseﬂow conditions. Future studies,
therefore, need to include characterization of the subpopulations
of FIB sediment loads through genetic methods of analysis to better understand their contribution to the water column. This would
facilitate differentiation of naturalized FIB from both enteric and
environmental sources and lead to improvements in public health
risk assessments of aquatic environments.
3.5. Aquatic vegetation as a reservoir for FIB
Aquatic vegetation can provide protection to FIB, which are susceptible to predation and the harmful effects of UV irradiation, and
the vegetation may also provide nutrient sources from thallus surface exudates (Beckinghausen et al., 2014; Marks and Power 2001;
McMinn et al., 2020; Nelson et al., 2018; Zulkiﬂy et al., 2012).
3.5.1. The alga Cladophora as a reservoir for FIB
The study of FIB associated with macrophytes has mainly focused on the green alga Cladophora, which inhabits both freshwater and marine environments. Cladophora colonises rocks and
piers, where it has a preference for growing on hard substrates
in shallow waters (Dodds and Gudder, 1992). From these substrates, Cladophora can break free and form large ﬂoating mats;
it is these mats that were ﬁrst identiﬁed as sources of FIB
when they washed up on beaches in the Great Lakes area of
North America (Byappanahalli et al., 2003b; Olapade et al., 2006;
Whitman et al., 2003). A study using culture methods and PCR,
identiﬁed pathogens (including Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli
species) in association with Cladophora (Ishii et al., 2006b). In contrast, a metagenomic investigation using 16S rRNA did not identify
pathogens or E. coli associated with the epiphytic bacterial community of actively growing Cladophora (Zulkiﬂy et al., 2012).
Microcosm studies of the impact of UV irradiation on the
interaction of Salmonella and E. coli with Cladophora noted extended survival of the two microbes when associated with the
alga, suggesting a protective effect provided by the algal mats
(Beckinghausen et al., 2014). Initial concentrations of E. coli underwent a seven-log reduction in numbers after six hours in water
with no algae present compared with 16 h for the same level of removal in the presence of algae. In comparison, Salmonella showed
a higher resistance to die-off with and without algal presence, with
greater persistence in the presence of the algal mats.
In another study, focused on in situ free-ﬂoating Cladophora,
the E. coli concentrations associated with the algal mats were
investigated by sampling water underlying the mats, adjacent
to the mats, and at regularly spaced intervals within the mats
(Heuvel et al., 2010). Concentrations of E. coli in the surrounding
water (1.0–3.5 Log10 MPN/100 mL) were signiﬁcantly lower than
in the water beneath the algal mats (3.0–4.0 Log10 MPN/100 mL).
Signiﬁcant positive correlations were identiﬁed in concentrations
of E. coli attached to the algae and E. coli in the water underlying
the algal mat. The concentration gradient of E. coli showed that
there were higher E. coli concentrations at the center of the mat
compared to the edges, presumably due to the mat’s protective inﬂuence from the effects of waves and wind.
A follow-up study on the Cladophora mats in Lake Michigan
(Badgley et al., 2011) conﬁrmed that algal mats may be a source
of E. coli to nearby water. E. coli from the mats (n = 40 0 0 isolates) were collected over a three-year timeframe and during multiple three-day sampling periods to analyze their population structure using DNA ﬁngerprint analyses. Spatially and temporally (over



16

annual periods), genetic analysis revealed a high degree of diversity between isolates, although 33% of isolates were represented by
(multiple) clonal groups. The authors suggested that these clonal
populations may represent naturalized groups of E. coli that are
persisting in the environment and have adapted to survive and
replicate within the algal mats (Badgley et al., 2011). E. coli isolates
were highly related within individual mats when the ﬁner detail of
diversity was examined between the mats and over the three-day
periods for individual mats. Furthermore, there was temporal genetic clustering of isolates when the same mat was examined over
a three-day period, suggesting transient populations that changed
on a daily basis. Together these results reﬂected a mosaic pattern
of E. coli strains from a variety of fecal inputs, and concurrent populations of naturalized E. coli populations. The authors concluded
that the complex and dynamic pattern of E. coli strains makes it
diﬃcult to use them as indicators for tracking the source of fecal
pollution.
Future studies of algal mats and algal blooms and their implications for water quality could include discrimination of FIB
subpopulations using the genetic tools described in this review.
This would facilitate the understanding of the role of non-fecal Escherichia and Enterococcus species in contributing to the increased
FIB loadings associated with mass gatherings of algae in the water
column and dried algal mats washed up on the shores of beaches
and lakes.
3.5.2. Aquatic plants as a reservoir of FIB
In freshwater and estuarine environments, Badgley et al.
(2010a) conducted a survey of the concentration and genetic makeup of enterococci populations associated with a variety of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), sediment and water. They noted
a decreasing mean density of enterococci concentrations from SAV
to sediment to water (Table 4), with a range of genetic diversity
from high to low. The lowest diversity was noted in lake water
during summer. They also provided evidence for the persistence of
certain enterococci strains that might represent naturalized populations.
In mesocosm studies, Badgley et al. (2010b) studied the effects of submerged macrophytes on enterococci populations. They
seeded the mesocosms with freshwater populations of SAV (mostly
the plant Hydrilla verticillata), water and sediment. At the time of
sampling, all matrices had chronically elevated levels of enterococci. The concentrations of enterococci were monitored over 14
days in the mesocosms of sediment and water, which were seeded
with and without SAV. As in the study of Badgley et al. (2010a),
enterococci were observed in the highest densities in the macrophytes compared with sediments and water. Furthermore, the
presence of SAV was observed to facilitate the persistence of enterococci in the vegetated mesocosms compared with non-vegetated
mesocosms. However, when comparing their total mass to water
and sediment matrices, the contribution of macrophyte-associated
enterococci was determined to be a minor portion of the entire
system.
The importance of FIB-associated substrates on water quality
concentrations will be location-dependent with factors such as the
total mass of the substrate reservoirs and the volume of water
available for resuspension playing signiﬁcant roles (Badgley et al.,
2010b). Genotypic typing of the enterococci strains throughout the
study revealed that the population was dominated by a single
strain of Enterococcus casseliﬂavus. This bacterium has commonly
been associated with vegetation and waterfowl (Aarestrup et al.,
2002; Cho et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). Additionally, E. casseliﬂavus was identiﬁed as an inhabitant of the lake from which the
plant material was sourced for the experiments. This “naturalized”
strain of E. casseliﬂavus persisted over the ten-month duration of
the study, suggesting its ability to reproduce in the environment.

The impact of the aquatic macrophytes Sagittaria and Myriophyllum on E. coli concentrations in freshwater was studied by
Leewis (2006). An increased E. coli concentration was noted in association with macrophyte mats in comparison to the E. coli concentrations in water at distances of 2, 5 and 10 m from the mats.
These ﬁndings were similar to the Cladophora mat experiments of
Heuvel et al. (2010).
Sediment and vegetation collected from the water surface were
investigated as reservoirs of fecal coliforms and enterococci by
Nguyen et al. (2018). Similar to Badgley et al. (2010a), these researchers compared the concentration of FIB in the wet weight of
sediment (100 g) or vegetation (100 g) with 100 mL of water sample, and showed that concentrations in the sediment and vegetation were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher compared with the water, adding to the evidence that these matrices act as reservoirs of
FIB.
The problems of invasive weed populations in aquatic environments was highlighted in a study of the association between the
introduced submerged macrophyte (Eurasian watermilfoil), E. coli
and bacterial pathogens in North American lakes (Mathai et al.,
2019). They identiﬁed that the Eurasian watermilfoil could harbor
elevated densities of E. coli and be an agent of dispersal of these
and other bacteria. In this study, molecular methods including PCR
markers and DNA metagenomic sequencing identiﬁed avian pollution as the primary source of the fecal bacteria associated with this
invasive weed.
3.5.3. Periphyton as reservoirs for FIB
Bioﬁlms of periphyton form on submerged substrates and consist of green algae, diatoms, protozoa and a complex community
of microbes including fungi and cyanobacteria (Li et al., 2018).
Ksoll et al. (2007) investigated the contribution of periphyton
as reservoirs of fecal coliforms in a freshwater temperate lake.
In the summer, periphyton-associated concentrations of fecal coliforms peaked at 105 CFU/cm2 . Using genetic subtyping techniques,
Ksoll et al. (2007) determined that waterfowl and sewage were the
major fecal sources of the E. coli contributing to water samples
overlying the periphyton. They also identiﬁed some E. coli strains
that persisted over time but could not be attributed to a source,
postulating that these strains may belong to a group of “naturalized” E. coli. As this study was conducted prior to the recognition
of the Escherichia cryptic clades, it is possible that this last subset of “E. coli” could potentially belong to the cryptic clades rather
than naturalized E. coli. Moreira et al. (2012) isolated strains of E.
coli from periphyton in freshwater lakes and established that they
had enhanced bioﬁlm formation capability when compared with
E. coli strains isolated from bovine and human fecal sources. As
noted in other studies, Moreira et al. (2012) suggested that bioﬁlm
formation may give persistent E. coli strains a selective survival advantage in aquatic environments (Di Sante et al. 2018; Ingle et al.,
2011; Liang et al., 2016; Tymensen et al., 2015; Zhi et al.,
2019).
A mesocosm study measured the interaction of genetic markers between the water column and periphyton in an experimental stream facility subjected to wastewater inputs (Li et al., 2018).
The genetic markers targeted E. coli, enterococci, and human fecal markers. As seen in the study of Stocker et al. (2019) for E. coli
and enterococci (Table 4), the researchers established that the periphyton can act as environmental reservoirs for these genetic markers and presumably, the bacteria they target. The net ﬂux shifts
between concentrations of each marker in the water inﬂow compared with the outﬂow showed that the genetic markers can be resuspended from the periphyton but that partitioning of the markers between the water column and the periphyton is dynamic and
complex (Li et al., 2018). The study of FIB concentrations in a rural creek over approximately 3 km of its course showed signiﬁcant



M.L. Devane, E. Moriarty and L. Weaver et al. / Water Research 185 (2020) 116204

correlations between concentrations of E. coli in water, sediment
and periphyton and similar but lower correlations between enterococci and the three matrices (Stocker et al., 2019). There were consistently higher concentrations of FIB recovered from periphyton
than sediment samples collected in the same location (Table 4). FIB
levels in the periphyton were signiﬁcantly higher in the summer
samplings compared with winter and of the three matrices, the periphyton showed the highest variability followed by sediment. The
study concluded that FIB survivability was highest in periphyton,
followed by sediment and then water.
Overall, aquatic vegetation can harbor signiﬁcant loads of FIB
species in relation to their mass compared with the other matrices
(sediment and water) in aquatic environments, and therefore, have
the potential to contribute signiﬁcant concentrations of FIB to the
water column. The total mass and resuspension potential of each
matrix, however, needs to be evaluated to determine if these FIB
harbored by aquatic vegetation will be major contributors to FIB
water quality monitoring results.
3.6. Micro-invertebrates as an environmental reservoir of
microorganisms
The identiﬁcation of microorganisms in micro-invertebrates
adds another facet to the persistence of fecally-derived microbes in
the environment, with the micro-invertebrate hypothesized to act
as a Trojan horse (Barker and Brown 1994; McDougald and Longford 2020). Neogi et al. (2014) deﬁnes micro-invertebrates as organisms mostly in the range of 50–500 μm but up to 5 mm, and
includes copepods, rotifers, nematodes, protozoa, crustacean larvae
and some insect larvae.
As predators, micro-invertebrates can have a negative inﬂuence on the numbers of bacteria, as shown by the grazing rates
of some in vitro protozoa being estimated at 20 0 0 bacteria ingested per hour (Macek et al., 1997). However, some bacteria,
including pathogens, have developed mechanisms to evade predation post-ingestion, and survive within the micro-invertebrate
(Boamah et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2013). Evidence now suggests that
protozoa such as amoeba can act as vectors of various bacteria
including E. coli and the pathogens Campylobacter and Legionella
(Buse and Ashbolt 2011; Greub and Raoult 2004; Hasni et al.,
2020; Moreno-Mesonero et al., 2020). Another potential transmission route for dissemination of these bacteria could occur when
avian species ingest micro-invertebrates. Under these circumstances, microorganisms could survive and grow within the microinvertebrates and evade the host’s immune system (Neogi et al.,
2014). Recent evidence suggests that convergent evolution has occurred where pathogens like Legionella, which originally adapted
to micro-invertebrate invasion, are now primed for virulence in human macrophages (Hasni et al., 2020; Neogi et al., 2014; Park et al.,
2020). This phenomenon has raised concern because the protozoa and their intracellular bacterial companions are resistant to
the chlorine doses used in municipal drinking water sources posing a health risk from the Trojan horse carriage of these pathogens
(Codony et al., 2012; King et al., 1988; Shaheen and Ashbolt 2018).
Researchers have observed nematodes feeding on and producing viable and infective forms of the oocysts of Cryptosporidium,
and bacterial pathogens, thus acting as vectors of these diseasecausing organisms (Anderson et al., 2003; Huamanchay et al.,
2004). More recently, studies have demonstrated occasions of nematodes ingesting Legionella infected amoeba and the subsequent
colonization of the nematode intestinal cells by Legionella, suggesting that nematodes could be another environmental reservoir of
pathogenic Legionella such as L. pneumophila (Hellinga et al., 2015;
Rasch et al., 2016).
The intracellular carriage of FIB and pathogens by microinvertebrates has implications for all water environments including

17

drinking water. Reported growth of microorganisms including E.
coli within these micro-invertebrate vectors could lead to the dissemination of FIB and pathogens into the water environment once
the micro-invertebrate decays and the cell wall ruptures resulting
in the release of high levels of FIB/pathogens.
3.7. Poikilothermic animals as reservoirs for E. coli and enterococci
Poikilothermic animals such as ﬁsh, snails and frogs have body
temperatures that vary in relation to their environment as compared to the homeostatic temperature of mammals or birds. In an
Australian study, E. coli was isolated from the feces or lower intestinal tract of vertebrates, including 12% of the frogs examined
(n = 106), with most of the frog isolates being associated with
urban environments (Gordon and Cowling, 2003). Reptiles such as
crocodiles, turtles and snakes were also noted to carry E. coli with
33%, 4% and 2% prevalence, respectively. In the same study, E. coli
was isolated from 10% of the ﬁsh examined (n = 138). Gordon and
Cowling (2003) used the Clermont 20 0 0 PCR to characterize the E.
coli isolates into the four known phylogroups of the time (A, B1,
B2, and D). Although sample numbers were too low for meaningful statistical analyses, the E. coli phylogroup B1 was identiﬁed as
having the highest prevalence in ﬁsh, frogs and reptiles.
A recent study identiﬁed high levels of E. coli and enterococci
in the guts of ﬁsh, frogs and gastropods (Frick et al., 2018). The
mean E. coli concentration in ﬁsh, frogs and gastropods (snails and
slugs) ranged between 4.2 and 5.2 log10 CFU/g of feces, with prevalence ranging from 68 to 85% (Table 4). Enterococci were similarly
present with a mean concentration ranging between 3.3 and 5.1
Log10 CFU/g, and a prevalence of 68 to 96%. E. coli were not identiﬁed in earthworms, but enterococci were present in low abundance. Researchers noted the concentrations of FIB in these poikilothermic organisms were similar to concentrations isolated from
mammals and bird feces in the same study (Frick et al., 2018). They
suggest that their ﬁndings challenge those of early researchers
(such as Geldreich and Clarke, 1966) that E. coli and enterococci
are not permanent members of the ﬁsh intestinal ﬂora. However,
Geldreich and Clarke (1966) did identify that the FIB intestinal concentration was dependent on the degree of fecal contamination
present in the aquatic environment. Frick et al. (2018) noted that
microbial results from waterways identiﬁed with low concentrations of FIB require careful interpretation, as the FIB may not be
from conventionally recognized fecal pollution sources. That study
and its conclusions are supported by another investigation of freshwater ﬁsh (trout, eel, inanga and bullies) in New Zealand where
E. coli and enterococci were recovered from 71% and 76% of fecal samples, respectively (Coxon et al., 2019). Concentrations of FIB,
although highly variable between individual ﬁsh samples, reached
maximum levels of 2.1 × 104 E. coli and 1.3 × 106 enterococci/g feces. Furthermore, concentrations of FIB in the water column were
recorded at substantially lower levels (for example, four orders of
magnitude less), suggesting potential replication or concentration
within the intestinal tract of ﬁsh (Coxon et al., 2019).
The isolation of E. coli and enterococci from poikilothermic organisms such as ﬁsh and reptiles prompts the question of whether
these aquatic organisms are providing an intestinal habitat for colonization of FIB and thus acting as a reservoir in aquatic environments. Another possibility is that the isolated FIB are members of a transient microbial community ingested from water and
passing through the gut of these aquatic species. Geldreich and
Clarke (1966) noted that FIB concentrations were not stably maintained as colonizers of ﬁsh intestines unless there was a continuous source of fecal contamination in the water. If recent research
establishes that FIB are colonizing the gut of ﬁsh species rather
than transiting the gut, this evidence would raise additional questions. It would be relevant to ask whether colonization of FIB in



18

M.L. Devane, E. Moriarty and L. Weaver et al. / Water Research 185 (2020) 116204

aquatic organisms is as a result of ongoing, high levels of fecal contamination in our chronically polluted aquatic environments. This
premise would change the original view that FIB are not a normal
part of the ﬁsh intestinal ﬂora as observed by Geldreich (1966).
This again raises the validity of FIB as indicators of mammalian fecal contamination inputs to our waterways.
Future research should identify if FIB populations within
aquatic species are diverse or made up of certain clonal strains
such as E. coli phylogroup B1, which is often identiﬁed as a persistent phylogroup isolated from waterways (Jokinen et al., 2019;
Tymensen et al., 2015). Furthermore, E. coli B1 was identiﬁed in
the earlier study of Gordon and Cowling (2003) as the main phylogroup in poikilothermic animals. Another question is whether the
Escherichia cryptic clades colonize the ﬁsh intestine, thereby suggesting that poikilothermic species may act as an unidentiﬁed fecal
reservoir for these naturalized Escherichia.
4. Conclusions and recommendations for future research
The FIB belonging to the genera Escherichia and Enterococcus
are widely identiﬁed in/on non-host environments including
soil, sediment, and aquatic vegetation including algae. Their
widespread presence in the environment has the potential to
confound water quality monitoring, which is typically based on
FIB as indicators of fecal contamination.
• Recent evidence suggests that FIB may be part of the microbiota of some aquatic organisms. Research is required to investigate whether the original hypothesis that E. coli and enterococci do not colonize the guts of aquatic organisms such as
reptiles and ﬁsh remains valid in the chronically polluted waters of current environments. If FIB are colonizing the intestine
of aquatic organisms then these organisms are acting as fecal
reservoirs for FIB with the potential to impact conventional water quality monitoring.
• Genomic studies have revealed that there are two groups of
“naturalized” FIB consisting of those defecated into the environment and able to persist under favourable conditions (indicators of non-recent fecal inputs); and those that are ancient
relatives of E. coli or enterococci lineages and naturally inhabit
the environmental reservoirs of waterways. This latter group is
identiﬁed as FIB by conventional water testing methods but because they are not derived from a fecal contamination event are
not correlated with health risk.
• For enterococci, there are many different species and some of
those species are truly environmental, while there is also evidence to suggest that some enteric enterococci species such as
E. faecalis have strains that have adapted their genome to an
environmental non-host lifestyle.
• Genes have been identiﬁed in enterococci that may be targets for differentiation of the enteric from naturalized enterococci. Further research is required to validate these enterococci
biomarkers.
• In the case of the Escherichia genus, there are two different
types of naturalized bacteria, which have the potential to confound water quality monitoring.
• One type of naturalized Escherichia are represented by the eight
phylogroups of E. coli and are derived from a mammalian/avian
fecal origin. These naturalized E. coli are able to survive postdefecation in the environment and reside in reservoirs such as
soil and river sediment where they may replicate. Within these
phylogroups, the B1 group has been identiﬁed as the most
prevalent E. coli phylogroup in environmental reservoirs.
• The other type of naturalized Escherichia, termed cryptic clades,
are identiﬁed as E. coli using conventional E. coli water quality
testing methods but in fact belong to separate species within
the Escherichia genus. Typical biochemical tests used to dif•

ferentiate E. coli from other Escherichia species do not distinguish these naturalized Escherichia cryptic clades from E. coli.
Escherichia cryptic clades have been rarely identiﬁed in human
clinical or mammalian fecal specimens and have low levels of
antibiotic resistance and few virulence genes. These ﬁndings
suggest that cryptic clades are likely to be poor indicators of
pathogens derived from fecal sources.
• Additional studies on fecal sources are required to determine
the environmental reservoirs of Escherichia cryptic clades, including aquatic poikilothermic species, avian and feral animals.
• In the search for biomarkers that distinguish between FIB
adapted to environmental versus enteric habitats, it is important to determine whether the environmentally- associated
strains have the ability to switch between their environmental reservoirs and the enteric environment by expressing genes
required for either lifestyle or whether those genes are absent
from their genome. Advances in whole genome sequencing and
metagenomic assays will aid the identiﬁcation of genes peculiar
or “enriched” in particular ecotypes that enable discrimination
between the enteric and naturalized FIB.
• Naturalized FIB that originate from a non-recent fecal contamination event, may be associated with fecal pathogens that also
endure in sediments. Pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium are
able to persist as hardy oocysts and may potentially be infectious post-defecation when harbored in soil and sediments.
Naturalized FIB derived from a fecal input, therefore, may still
represent a health risk.
