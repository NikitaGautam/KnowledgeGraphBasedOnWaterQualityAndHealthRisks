Background Microbial water-quality indicators, in high concentrations in
sewage, are used to determine whether water is safe for recreational
purposes. Recently, the use of these indicators to regulate recreational water bodies, particularly in sub/tropical recreational
marine waters without known sources of sewage, has been questioned. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the risk to
humans from exposure to subtropical recreational marine waters
with no known point source, and the possible relationship between
microbe densities and reported symptoms in human subjects with
random-exposure assignment and intensive individual microbial
monitoring in this environment.
Methods

A total of 1303 adult regular bathers were randomly assigned to
bather and non-bather groups, with subsequent follow-up for
reported illness, in conjunction with extensive environmental
sampling of indicator organisms (enterococci).

Results

Bathers were 1.76 times more likely to report gastrointestinal illness
[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94–3.30; P ¼ 0.07]; 4.46 times more
likely to report acute febrile respiratory illness (95% CI 0.99–20.90;
P ¼ 0.051) and 5.91 times more likely to report a skin illness (95%
CI 2.76–12.63; P < 0.0001) relative to non-bathers. Evidence of a
dose–response relationship was found between skin illnesses and
increasing enterococci exposure among bathers [1.46 times (95% CI
0.97–2.21; P ¼ 0.07) per increasing log10 unit of enterococci exposure], but not for gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses.

Conclusions This study indicated that bathers may be at increased risk of several
illnesses relative to non-bathers, even in the absence of any known

source of domestic sewage impacting the recreational marine
waters. There was no dose–response relationship between gastroenteritis and increasing exposure to enterococci, even though many
current water-monitoring standards use gastroenteritis as the major
outcome illness.

Traditionally, analogous to drinking water, monitoring of microbial water quality for coastal waters
used for recreational purposes has been regulated by
measuring the concentrations of indicator microbes.
These microbes are those typically found in human
faeces in high concentrations, and are not pathogenic.
Thus, an elevated concentration of these indicator microbes in coastal waters should indicate that these
waters have been contaminated by human sewage,
and are unsafe for recreational use.1–5
Recently, the use of indicator microbes to regulate
the recreational use of coastal waters has come into
question, particularly in subtropical marine environments characterized by no known source of human
sewage (i.e. non-point source). Studies conducted in
subtropical areas have shown collectively that, in the
absence of any known sources of human faecal materials, indicator microbes are consistently present,
and may be recovered in high concentrations in the
environment.6–14 It is thought that indicator microbes
may re-grow due to climate conditions conducive for
re-growth, and thus may not be representative of any
pathogens that might be present. However, the regulator is presented with a perplexing situation where
the possibility of micro-organisms or pathogens
within urban run-off might be responsible for an
increased risk of illness among bathers. In addition,
within subtropical waters, it remains unclear which
indicator microbe(s) should be utilized, and once
the data are obtained, how these data should be
interpreted.5,15
Several epidemiological studies have found that
bathing in temperate recreational waters with
known point sources of faecal contamination (such
as domestic sewage or storm-drain runoff) has been
associated with an increased risk for transmission of
infectious diseases (including gastroenteritis, and febrile respiratory, skin, eye and ear illnesses).3,16–26 The
few epidemiological studies conducted in subtropical
environments have shown no statistically significant
relationship between human health and current US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended indicator microbes for evaluating beach
water quality in subtropical regions.2,8,12,27 The objective of this study, the first prospective randomized exposure study in non-point source subtropical

recreational marine waters, was to evaluate the risks
to human health in recreational marine environment
with no known source of domestic sewage, and the
use of indicator organisms to assess these exposures
and risks.

Methods
The design of the epidemiological study was based on
past studies at the study site and on the work of
Fleisher et al.11,14,16–19,28–30 The investigators conducted a prospective randomized exposure study
with participant exposure randomly assigned to
either marine recreational waters or to beach-only
exposure. The epidemiological study data-collection
activities were conducted over 15 individual study
days beginning 15 December 2007 and ending 21
June 2008.

Epidemiological study protocol
Local adult residents (518 years of age) who reported
regular bathing in recreational marine waters were
recruited to participate using word of mouth, email
and local publicity as recruitment tools. After recruitment, the participants were screened for current illnesses and symptoms, possible alternative risk factors
for the study illnesses, and a brief health history; they
were then given an appointment for the study
beach-exposure day. Members of the same household
or family members were recruited, but subject to the
same randomization procedures as all other study
participants. Possible secondary spread of infection
among family members was ascertained by asking
‘Did any member of your family become ill before
or after recruitment into the study?’, with control in
subsequent statistical analyses.
On the study beach-exposure day, participants read
and signed the consent form. At this point, participants were again interviewed briefly about any current illnesses and symptoms, food consumption and
beach exposure since the baseline recruitment interview. Study subjects were then randomly assigned to
either (exposed) bather group or (unexposed)
non-bather group. The bathers were assigned to the
bathing station where staff members supervised the
exposure activity of each bather, including the time,
location, unusual activities and duration each

Introduction



THE BEACHES STUDY

Disease endpoint criteria
The disease endpoints of interest in this study were
self-reported symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal illness, acute febrile respiratory illness [i.e.
International Classification of Diseases 9: 461–466,
480], eye or ear infections and skin infections occurring within 7 days of beach exposure.
The following definitions were used to derive disease
endpoint categories prior to data analysis based on
the results of the seventh-day follow-up questionnaire. ‘Gastrointestinal illness’ was defined as a

report of the following symptoms: all cases of vomiting or diarrhoea, or all reported cases of indigestion or
nausea accompanied by a fever; ‘diarrhoea’ defined as
having three or more runny stools within a 24-h
period; ‘acute febrile respiratory illness’ defined as
report of at least one of each of the symptoms listed
in each of the three categories: (i) fever; (ii) headache
and/or body-aches and/or unusual fatigue and/or loss
of appetite; and (iii) sore throat and/or runny nose
and/or dry or productive cough; ‘skin illness’ defined
as report of at least one of the following symptoms:
(i) skin rash; (ii) skin ulcer/sore; or (iii) itching/irritation; ‘ear illness’ defined as report of an ear infection (sore/discharge); ‘eye illness’ as report of an eye
infection on the follow-up questionnaire. These illness
definitions were compatible with past studies carried
out by the investigators in Europe, and are roughly
compatible with the ‘highly creditable illness’ definitions used in the majority of the US recreational
water cohort studies.3,16–19,22

Environmental sampling and microbial assays
The study site had been well characterized by the
investigators previously in terms of the indicator organisms in the water and sediments as being a
non-point source subtropical beach with periodic use
by people, dogs and birds as well as seasonal heavy
rains.14,28–33
As described above, while each study participant
was in the water, each subject collected their own
environmental water sample from the demarcated
bathing lanes. All samples were collected in the morning between 8 am and 12 pm on each sampling day
concomitant with the epidemiological study. As
described above, water samples were collected in
knee-deep water by each study participant using
5 litres sterilized plastic containers; sampling points
from the shoreline ranged from 10 to 40 m depending
on tidal stage corresponding with the knee height.
Samples taken by each study participant were
assayed for enterococci by membrane filtration using
the method recommended by the US EPA.34,35
Randomization, epidemiological study
database and statistical analyses
Block randomization into bather and non-bather
groups was used to maximize the probability of
achieving an equal number of study participants in
the two groups under study. Block size consisted of
a random ordering of blocks of two, four and six
study participants per individual block. It should be
noted that the random ordering of block size eliminates any chance of study personnel discovering the
blocking pattern. Participants were only informed of
their randomized status after completing the
pre-exposure day interview at the beach. The sample
size was calculated to obtain a difference in gastrointestinal illness between bathers and non-bathers of 5/
100 at a ¼ 0.05 and b ¼ 0.80.

individual bather spent in the water. Bathers were
required to spend 15 min in knee-deep water (due
to the relative shallowness of the study site), and to
immerse their head three times completely under
water. Using ropes, a 30–40-m stretch of beach was
subdivided into 5-m intervals forming six to eight
bathing exposure zones, with exposure of any individual bather restricted to their own individual swim
zone that was 5 m wide. Each subject was instructed
to take their own water sample at 5-min intervals
near the surface before their head immersion, as
well as provided with an appropriate individual
water-sampling container. Staff members instructed
participants to thoroughly rinse the collection container before filling completely with the marine
water, as well as the avoidance of microbial contamination of the collection container by the participant.
When the subjects left the water, they gave their individual water samples to the environmental research
study staff for microbial analysis processing
(described below). No bather was allowed to enter
the water more than once during the actual study
exposure. The participants in the randomized
non-bather group were restricted to sitting on chairs
on plastic sheeting in a covered roped-off area distant
from water and sand exposure for 15 min.
After participating in the beach-day protocol, all
participants were given a US$50 gift card, and an
appointment to complete an extensive follow-up
phone questionnaire 7 days after the beach visit.
After completing the follow-up questionnaire, study
participants received an additional US $25 gift card
to compensate them for participating in the study.
Informed consent documents and study questionnaires were provided in English and Spanish, and
approved by the Florida Department of Health and
University of Miami Human Subjects Committees.
The questionnaires (as well as the study design)
were adapted from those of Dr David Kay and Dr
Jay M. Fleisher from the prospective randomized exposure studies in the UK and Europe.16–19,22
Adaptations included some language changes to
‘American’ English, as well as logistical changes (in
particular, instead of follow-up at 7 days and 3 weeks,
due to resources and logistics, these follow-ups were
combined into a single follow-up questionnaire given
7 days post exposure via telephone).

Results
Of 1341 subjects who participated in the 15 beach
study days, 38 (2.9%) were lost to follow-up, resulting in a final total study cohort of 1303 with a
follow-up of 97.1%. Of note, 80% of the 1303 subjects
were successfully followed up within 7 days of exposure, and the remaining 20% within 3 weeks. After
randomization, there were 652 bathers and 651
non-bathers. Randomization of subjects into bather
and non-bather exposure for the purposes of the

study was successful in terms of equal distribution
of demographics with no significant differences
(Table 2).
The distribution of enterococci exposure among
bathers was: for all 668 bathers, the mean enterococci
exposure was 71 enterococci/100 ml [standard deviation (SD) 244]; the median ¼ 19 enterococci/
100 ml; the minimum exposure below the detection
limit of 2 enterococci/100 ml; and the maximum
enterococci exposure ¼ 3320 enterococci/100 ml. We
recorded the number of days between the exposure
study day for each individual participant and the
day of onset of their symptoms. For gastrointestinal
illnesses, the average time for bathers to the onset of
symptoms was 6.10 (SD 2.81) days and for
non-bathers 7.78 (SD 3.15) days (P ¼ 0.16); for
acute febrile illness, bathers 5.18 (SD 2.44) days and
for non-bathers 12 (SD 2.82) days (P ¼ 0.004]; for
skin illnesses, bathers 4.36 (SD 2.56) days and for
non-bathers 5.55 (SD 2.17) (P ¼ 0.19); for eye illnesses, bathers 5.75 (SD 2.56) days and for
non-bathers 9.20 (SD 7.19) days, (P ¼ 0.41); and
for ear illnesses, bathers 3.67 (SD 1.75) days and for
non-bathers 9.67 (SD 0.58) days, (P ¼ 0.0008).
For every illness outcome, the un-exposed
non-bathers reported a longer time to onset than
the exposed bathers.

Bathers vs non-bathers
Bathers reported more gastrointestinal illness
(P ¼ 0.08), respiratory illness (P ¼ 0.04) and skin illness (P ¼ 0.0001) relative to non-bathers (Table 3).
After controlling for non-water-related risk factors/
possible confounders for each of these illnesses
using multiple logistic regression analysis, subsequent
to 7 days of follow-up from beach exposure, bathers
were 1.79 times [odds ratio 1.79; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.94–3.43; P ¼ 0.07] more likely to
report gastrointestinal illness relative to non-bathers;
bathers were 4.46 times (95% CI 0.99–20.97;
P ¼ 0.051) more likely to report acute febrile

The statistical software packages Statistical Analysis
Software (SAS), and where necessary StatXact, were
used to perform all statistical analyses. Initial analyses
evaluated the effects of randomization for all demographic variables to insure equal distribution of demographic risk factors among exposed (i.e. bathers) and
the unexposed (i.e. non-bathers). Subsequent basic
analyses were geared to answer two questions: (i)
‘Was there an excess of the illnesses under study
among bathers vs non-bathers?’; and (ii) ‘Was there
a dose–response relationship between indicator
organism density and the incidence of the outcome
illnesses studied among bathers?’. Participants reporting a particular illness on the study day were
excluded from the statistical analysis of that particular illness. Statistical analyses included univariate
analysis using chi-square and, where expected cell
size was <5, the Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed).
Unconditional logistic regression modelling was
then used to control for possible confounders/
non-water-related risk factors among bathers vs
non-bathers. Non-water-related risk factors or possible confounders for all outcome illness under analysis were evaluated separately in univariate analyses
(Table 1). Inclusion criterion for the potential confounders was P < 0.15, with a model retention criterion of P < 0.05. A backward stepwise elimination
strategy was employed.

Enterococci exposure was modelled as a continuous
variable (data not shown). Enterococci exposures
were transformed via log10 prior to inclusion into
the model. The results showed that the risk of a
skin illness increased by 1.46 times (0.97–2.21;
P ¼ 0.07) per increasing log10 unit of enterococci exposure, while controlling for gender and for the question ‘Have you heard anything about chemical
pollution and bathing waters?’ as a measure of risk
perception (P ¼ 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). A plot of
the probability of bathers contracting skin illness with
increasing enterococci exposure (after log10 transformation) with 95% CIs is illustrated in Figure 1.
With regard to gastroenteritis, the same method of
analysis was used, but demonstrated no relationship
with the increasing levels of enterococci (1.39 per
increasing log10 unit of enterococci exposure (0.74–
2.61; P ¼ 0.31), and thus no dose–response
relationship).

Discussion
This study was the first randomized exposure study of
bathers with individual exposure assessment in subtropical recreational marine waters with no known
source of domestic sewage. The results demonstrated
bathers to be at increased risk of reported gastrointestinal, acute febrile respiratory and skin illnesses relative to non-bathers. In addition, there was evidence
for a dose–response relationship between bather exposure to increasing levels of enterococci and an
increased risk of reporting skin illness.
The fact that we found no dose–response relationship between respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses
and enterococci exposure remains unexplained, and
may be a result of the study sample size. Based on
our prior studies, some contribution to each individual participant’s enterococci exposure may have come
from their own bacterial shedding; however, our prior
research has indicated that this is not the major
source of enterococci exposure in non-point source
subtropical recreational marine waters.29,32,33 It
should be noted that the actual pathogens responsible
for all of these illnesses remain unknown; they may

illness. No substantial confounding was observed between any of these three illnesses and the
non-water-related risk factor/confounders (Table 4).
No differences between bathers and non-bathers for
ear and eye illnesses were observed (Table 3).

risk for gastroenteritis was 3.17/100 (P ¼ 0.01); for
acute febrile respiratory illness, the excess risk was
1.28/100 (P ¼ 0.04); and for skin illness, the excess
risk was 6.03/100 (P < 0.0001).

CFU, colony forming units

vary from study site to study site, and thus, the apparent lack of correlation with enterococci exposure
reported herein. Although ‘urban runoff’ is a probable
source of pathogen(s), we cannot rule out other
micro-organisms that are naturally present in subtropical marine waters and not the result of contamination by man and other animals. If this is the case,
we would not expect a correlation with any indicator
organism. Since this study was the first randomized
prospective exposure of bathers performed in subtropical recreational marine waters with no known point
source, additional studies need to be performed to
confirm and explore our results further.
This is the only study of the association between
concentrations of microbial water contamination and
subsequent illnesses in which the bathers collected

their own water samples at the same time they
were being ‘exposed’. This should provide the most
accurate estimate of individual exposure to
water-borne microbial indicators, including enterococci, to date. This should aid to minimize the
misclassification of exposures associated with
non-randomized cohort designs, which would likely
be non-differential, and thus result in an underestimation of the risk. It must, however, be emphasized that
the bather cohort used in our study consisted of regular adult bathers. Care must therefore be used when
interpreting these findings, especially with respect to
susceptible subpopulations such as small children or
anyone with a compromised immune system.15,36
In addition to individual exposure assessment, another strength of our study was that, unlike the designs of almost all other published epidemiological
studies which used a prospective cohort design, the
basic unit of measurement was the individual bather
rather than the average rates of illness among many
bathers on different study days. This use of an aggregated measure of individual exposures (i.e. rates or
rate differences) as the basic unit of measurement
in all previous prospective cohort designs would lead
to significant misclassification of exposure bias.16 The
design of the study reported herein would minimize
this source of misclassification of exposure bias. In
addition, the randomization of individual study participants who reported bathing regularly in recreational marine waters into exposed and unexposed
groups solely for the purposes of the study further
avoided another bias possibly inherent in the prospective cohort design: the hypothesized phenomena
that persons who report regular non-bathing might
constitute a less healthy group relative to regular
bathers, leading to a self-selection bias.17,37,38 In the
presence of such selection bias (unavoidable in previous prospective cohort studies), the comparison of

KEY MESSAGES
 The objectives of this study were to evaluate the risk to humans from exposure to subtropical
recreational marine waters with no known point source of microbial pollution.
 This study indicated that bathers may be at increased risk of several illnesses relative to non-bathers,
even in the absence of any known source of domestic sewage impacting the recreational marine waters.
 Interestingly, no dose–response relationship between gastroenteritis and increasing exposure to
enterococci was detected, given that many current water monitoring standards use gastroenteritis
as the major outcome illness and enterococcus as the recommended indicator organism for monitoring purposes.

bathers with non-bathers might lead to results of
questionable validity.
In a regulatory context, the results we report can be
transformed into the probability of illness, attributable risk and other measures of risk, thus avoiding
the use of rates as the basic unit of measurement
published in previous prospective cohort designs,
which inevitably introduce misclassification of exposure. Thus, the methods used in this study will supply
the regulator with more accurate estimates of risk
upon which to build criteria in the future.
The implications of the findings of this study are far
reaching. Our findings suggest that there is an
increased risk to bathers even when using marine recreational waters with no known source of domestic
sewage. We also observed a correlational dose–response
association between skin illnesses and increasing enterococci exposure. These findings might indicate that microbes from non-point sources are causing increased
risk from pathogens introduced by urban run-off, and
thus from a regulatory viewpoint,20 the notion of zero
additional risk to bathers could be challenged.15
Further epidemiological and laboratory studies will be
necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
