Concentration and analysis of bather-collected composite samples

50

Bather-collected composites were analyzed for many different microbes including the EPA-recommended

51

marine bacterial indicator, enterococci, using three methods: membrane filtration (MF), chromogenic

52

substrate (CS), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), additional microbial indicators (fecal

53

coliform, E. coli, C. perfringens, and coliphage), human and dog-associated microbial source tracking

54

(MST) markers including Bacteriodales (B. thetaiotaomicron , BacHum-UCD, HF8, and Dog-specific),

55

human polyomavirus (HPyVs) and the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium. Pathogens evaluated included:

56

bacteria (S. aureus by MF, and Vibrio vulnificus by MF with confirmation by PCR); protozoa

57

(Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. via microscopy and qPCR); and viruses (pan enterovirus,

58

norovirus, and hepatitis A via qPCR). Given the range of microbes analyzed, 30 to 50 L bather-collected

59

composite water samples were split between several laboratories to facilitate analysis as follows. One liter

60

was used for the analysis of enterococci (MF), fecal coliform, E. coli, C. perfringens and S.aureus at the

61

University of Miami. Three liters were aliquoted to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric

62

Administration (NOAA) Hollings Marine Laboratory Center of Excellence located in Charleston, SC, for

63

the analysis of coliphage while 1 liter was aliquoted to the University of South Florida for the analysis of

64

polyomavirus. Six liters were used for the analysis of enterococci(CS), enterococci(qPCR), and

65

Bacteriodales (BacHum-UCD, HF8, and Dog-specific) at the NOAA, Miami lab. Enterococci(qPCR) and

66

these Bacteriodales analyses resulted from the same DNA extraction. One liter was aliquoted to the

67

University of Missouri for the analysis of B. thetaiotaomicron and one liter was used by BCS laboratories

68

for the analysis of Vibrio vulnificus and Enterococcus faecium esp gene. Finally ten liters were used for

69

the analysis of protozoa and viruses by PCR at the University of Florida laboratories. The actual volumes

70

analyzed for each microbe, as well as the methods used in the analysis, are summarized below.

2



71

Fecal indicator microbes. Fecal coliform, E.coli, C. perfringens and enterococci (MF) were analyzed in

72

triplicate for the composite samples by standard MF methods. In brief, water samples were vacuum

73

filtered through 0.45μm pore size, 47 mm membranes. Sample volumes analyzed ranged from 5 to 50 ml

74

to allow for detection of a wide range of concentrations. Sample volumes below 50 ml were raised to 50

75

ml using PBS to allow for a more uniform distribution of colonies on the filter. Filter membranes for

76

fecal coliform analyses were placed on mFC agar and incubated for 24 h at 44.5 ± 0.2°C. Target blue

77

colonies were counted and reported as colony forming units (CFU) 100 ml-1 as per Standard Method 9222

78

D (APHA 1998). Filter membranes for E. coli analyses were placed on selective and differential medium,

79

modified mTEC agar, incubated at 35 ± 0.5°C for 2 h to resuscitate the injured or stressed bacteria, and

80

then incubated at 44.5 ± 0.2°C for 22 h. Target red or magenta colonies were counted and reported as

81

CFU 100 ml-1 as per USEPA Method 1603 (USEPA 2002). Filter membranes for C. perfringens analyses

82

were placed on mCP agar and incubated anaerobically for 24 h at 44.5 ± 0.2°C. Upon exposure to

83

ammonium hydroxide, yellow straw-colored colonies, which turned dark pink to magenta, were counted

84

as C. perfringens and reported as CFU 100 ml-1 (USEPA 1995). Filter membranes for enterococci

85

analyses were placed on mEI agar and incubated for 24 hours at 41 + 0.5 ºC. Target blue colonies and

86

colonies with blue halos were counted and reported as colony forming units CFU 100 ml-1 as per USEPA

87

Method 1600 (USEPA 2002).

88

Enterococci were also analyzed in triplicate by the chromogenic substrate (CS) method and by

89

qPCR. CS analysis followed the manufacturer’s instructions with sample volumes of 10 and 2 ml diluted

90

to 100 ml and placed in a tray (Quantitray-2000™, IDEXX™, Westbrook, ME), which distributed the

91

sample into a series of wells which permitted for enumeration based upon a most probable number

92

(MPN). The analysis of enterococci by qPCR was conducted by filtering 1000 ml of the water sample

93

through 0.45 μm pore size, 47 mm membranes. The filters were then rolled up and placed in bead beating

94

tubes. Whole cells of Lactococcus lactis (105) were added to each filter to provide a measure for

95

extraction efficiency and inihibition. DNA was extracted from the filters into a 100 µl volume solution

96

using the Fast DNA® Spin Kit (Cat# 6540-600, MP Biomedicals). Specifically, 1.0 µl of the sample,
3



97

0.125 µl each of forward and reverse primers, 0.100 µl of TaqMan probe, 12.5 µl of two times master mix

98

(Qiagen Quantitect Cat#204343), and 11.15 µl of sterile PCR grade water (from master mix kit) were

99

used giving a total volume of 25 µl. The primers and probes followed those as specified by Haugland et

100

al. (2005). Enterococcus faecalis cultures from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used as

101

genomic control standards. Values for qPCR analysis were reported in units of genome equivalence units

102

(GEU) per 100 ml. More details are available in the supplement to Sinigalliano et al. 2010.

103

Both male-specific (F+) and somatic (F-) coliphages were enumerated in this study following US

104

EPA Method 1602, the Single Agar Layer Procedure (USEPA 2001). Coliphage are viruses that infect E.

105

coli and other coliform bacteria. Male-specific coliphage (F+) infect their bacterial hosts by attachment

106

to the F- pilus of the cell. They can only infect hosts which contain the F+ plasmid. Somatic coliphages

107

(F-) infect bacterial hosts by direct attachment to cell walls and not through an F- pilus. Briefly, water

108

samples were mixed with host bacteria, magnesium chlorine and double strength molten agar medium.

109

The host used for enumeration of F+ coliphages was E. coli Famp (ATCC 700891) while somatic

110

coliphages were isolated on E. coli CN13 (700609). To prohibit growth from other bacteria within each

111

water sample, culture media for detection of F+ coliphages was supplemented with streptomycin (final

112

concentration 15µg/mL) and ampicillin (final concentration 15µg/mL). Culture media for somatic

113

coliphages was supplemented with nalidixic acid (final concentration 100µg/mL). Sample mixtures were

114

then poured into 5-6 large Petri dishes. The plates were allowed to dry, and then incubated overnight at

115

37oC. All plates from a single sample were examined for plaque formation, as indicated by zones of

116

clearning on the bacterial host lawn. Plaques were totaled per sample, and the coliphage concentration

117

was expressed as plaque forming units (PFU) per 100 mL.

118
119

MST Markers. Bacteroidales were analyzed in triplicate using qPCR while using a set of three different

120

primers, two for human-specific Bacteriodales (HF-8, Bernhard and Field 2000 a,b and BacHum-UCD,

121

Kildare et al. 2007) and one for the dog-specific Bacteroidales (Dick et al. 2005). One microliter aliquots

122

of the DNA extract described earlier for the enterococci analysis via qPCR were used for Bacteroidales
4



123

analysis. The remaining steps were the same as for enterococci with the exception of the primers, probes,

124

and the controls. Bacteroides dorei cultures were used as genomic controls for both human specific

125

Bacteroidales (HF-8 and BacHum-UCD), and Invitrogen pCR-Blunt2-topo plasmid was used as the

126

control for the dog-specific Bacteroidales. The HF-8 and BacHum-UCD values are reported in GEU per

127

100 ml and the dog-specific values are reported in target sequence copies (TSC) per 100 ml. More details

128

are available in the supplement to Sinigalliano et al. 2010.

129

For B. thetaiotaomicron analysis, 400 mL of water from each sample was filtered through a 0.20

130

μm polycarbonate filter (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The polycarbonate filter was placed into a

131

15mL conical tube. The tube was vortexed for 2 minutes and the filter removed. Conical tubes were first

132

concentrated by centrifugation at 2052 g for 15 minutes at 4ºC. The supernatant was discarded, except for

133

200 μl, which was used to resuspend the pellet. DNA was extracted with the Powersoil DNA Extraction

134

Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc.). The extracted DNA was analyzed for presence of B. thetaiotaomicron by

135

PCR (Eppendorf Master Mix 2.5, Brinkman Instruments, Inc, Westbury, NY) with primers (B.thetaF and

136

B.thetaR).

137

The presence of the E. faecium esp gene was assessed in water and sand eluate samples according

138

to previously published methods with some modifications (Scott et al. 2005). Specifically, following

139

filtration of 300 ml and 20 ml of water and sand eluate samples, respectively, mEI plates were incubated

140

at 37°C rather than 41°C and following this incubation, the membranes were lifted, placed into azide

141

dextrose broth (BD BBL™, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated for an additional 6 hours to enrich the

142

culture prior to DNA extraction. The incubation temperature was decreased because it was found to

143

enhance the recovery of enterococci which possess the esp gene.

144

Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) were concentrated from 600 ml of water samples. Briefly, the

145

pH of the samples were adjusted to 9.5 using 1M NaOH and the samples were then passed through a pre-

146

filter to prevent clogging at the final filtration step. Next, the pH of the eluate was adjusted to 3.5 using

147

2N HCl to promote electrostatic interactions between the viral capsid and filter. The viruses were then

148

concentrated on 47-mm, 0.45µm nitrocellulose filters. The filters were placed into 30-ml polypropylene
5



149

tubes and the viruses were eluted off the filters using 2-ml of 3% beef extract (pH 9.3). DNA was

150

extracted from the beef extract eluent using QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen™, Valencia, CA).

151

HPyVs were detected using a nested PCR assay according to a pre-published method (McQuaig et al.

152

2006).

153
154

Pathogens. S. aureus was isolated in triplicate from 50 mL water samples using a standard membrane

155

filter (MF) followed by growth on selective media, Baird Parker agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company,

156

Sparks, MD) with Egg Yolk (EY) Tellurite Enrichment (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD).

157

Filter membranes were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for a minimum of 24h. After incubation, colonies

158

found to be black, shiny, convex, 2-5mm in diameter, and surrounded by clear zones (BP) were

159

considered presumptive S. aureus, and subjected to confirmatory tests. Presumptive positive isolates

160

were transferred to Mannitol Salt agar for the determination of mannitol fermentation, and incubated

161

aerobically at 37 °C for 16-24h. Mannitol-fermenting isolates were transferred to Trypticase Soy Agar

162

with 5% Sheep Blood (TSA II, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) and subjected to latex

163

agglutination test for clumping factor and protein A using the Remel BactiStaph Latex Agglutination Test

164

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS). Whole cell extract of each positive isolate was obtained using the

165

Amplicor MTB Sputum Specimen Preparation Kit (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Indianapolis, IN)

166

according to the manufacture’s recommendations, and served as template DNA in real-time polymerase

167

chain reactions (PCR) to amplify the S. aureus specific gyrA gene for organism confirmation.

168

Oligonucleotide primers and thermal cycling conditions were used as described previously (Mertz et al.

169

2007), with the minor modification that 5-µl of crude lysate was used as template in initial PCR reactions

170

instead of purified chromosomal DNA. Bacterial isolates determined to be positive for S. aureus specific

171

gyrA were subjected to additional PCR to test for the methicillin resistance gene, mecA, as a marker for

172

MRSA (Mertz et al. 2007).

6



173

V. vulnificus was analyzed by filtering 300 ml of water onto a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose filter.

174

Filters were then placed on VVA agar, prepared as per the Bacteriological Analytical Manual Online to

175

isolate V. vulnificus (Kaysner and DePaola 2008). Yellow colonies were counted as presumptive V.

176

vulnificus. Genomic DNA was extracted from all the filters using the Qiagen™ QiaAmp DNA Mini Kit

177

following manufacturer’s instructions and DNA extracts were confirmed for the presence of V. vulnificus

178

DNA as per Gordon et al. 2008. Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, Pan enterovirus, norovirus, and

179

hepatitis A virus were concentrated using five liter filtrations through the bi-layer filtration system and

180

analyzed via qPCR. The bi-layer filtration system (Abdelzaher et al. 2008; Abdelzaher et al. 2009)

181

utilizes two 0.45 μm, 90 mm membranes placed in series in a stainless steel filter holder. The top PVDF

182

filter captured protozoa by size exclusion while the bottom HA-type membrane captured viruses using

183

electrostatic forces. Filtration volumes were 2 to 5 L for water and 450 to 1000 ml for sand eluates.

184

Filtration progressed until 20 to 40 ml of the sample volume remained suspended above the top

185

membrane. This suspension was collected for protozoan analysis. The top membrane was eluted with 10

186

ml followed by 5 ml of PBS +0.01% Tween 20 solution adapted from the IDEXX™ FiltaMax™ method.

187

This was done by placing the membrane in a sterile Whirlpack™ bag and rubbing for 3 minutes then

188

adding the eluent to the 20 to 40 ml suspended volume for a concentrate of less than 50 ml. The DNA

189

from the sample was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA kit (MO BIO Laboratories™, Carlsbad, CA)

190

according to the manufacturer’s protocol with a few modifications. Briefly, 10 freeze/thaw steps

191

alternating between liquid nitrogen and 65°C were performed in the kit’s lysis buffer supplemented with

192

100μg/mL proteinase K. The purified DNA was then subjected to qPCR analysis using primers described

193

in pre-published methods (Guy et al. 2003).

194
195

The bottom membrane was eluted first with 7 ml then another 3 ml of guanidinium hydrochloride

196

detergent solution (AL/ASL solution in a 1:1 ratio from the Qiagen Blood kit plus 0.1 ml of Antifoam A

197

per 120 ml of elution solution to prevent foaming). This combined solution was intended to inactivate as

198

well as elute the viruses from the membrane, which passed the top membrane and were captured on the
7



199

bottom. The elution was accomplished by placing the bottom membrane in a sterile Whirlpack™ bag

200

along with the elution solution and rubbing for 3 minutes for a final volume of less than 10 ml. These

201

eluates were then subjected to additional concentration by the Qiagen Blood kit following the

202

manufacturer’s instructions. The purified and concentrated RNA was then further processed using Trizol

203

reagent (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA) and the RNA pellet was re-suspended in nuclease-free water. RNA

204

was reversed transcribed using the cDNA First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA) with

205

random hexamers. The cDNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers and probes previously described for

206

norovirus, hepatitius A, and enterovirus (DeLeon et al. 1990).

207
208

Concentration and analysis of personnel-collected composite samples

209
210

Personnel-collected composite samples consisted of two large drums of approximately 225 L. The water

211

in one of the drums was used for protozoan analysis (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp) while the

212

water in the other was used for enterovirus analysis. These larger volume samples were used in order to

213

detect lower concentrations which would not be possible with the bi-layer filtration method for the bather-

214

collected composite samples. Protozoan filtration and analysis for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia

215

spp. utilized PALL™ Envirocheck™ filters, with subsequent elution and analysis using EPA Method 1623

216

(USEPA 2005). In brief, the filtration was conducted at an average flow rate of 2L/min and the operating

217

pressure did not exceed 75 psi. An exception to the EPA Method 1623 filtration setup was the addition of

218

an overflow valve installed upstream of the filter to provide for more control on the flow rate and filter

219

pressure. Filters were eluted, the pellet was concentrated, and Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp

220

were purified using immuno-magnetic separation. The purified pellet was stained with a fluorescent

221

antibody and the numbers of oocysts/cysts were counted using a microscope. Positive and negative

222

controls were included in the analysis as per standard protocols.

223

Virus concentration and analysis was conducted predominantly as per USEPA 600/R-95/178 (ICR

224

Microbial Laboratory Manual1996). However, electronegative filters (0.45 um pleated fiberglass filter
8



225

cartridges, Pall Corporation, USA) were utilized in this study because electropositive filters lack the

226

efficiency in salt water systems. This was conducted as per Standard Methods for the Analysis of Water

227

and Wastewater, Section 9510 C (APHA 2005). The pH of the filtered water was adjusted to 3.5 by the

228

addition of 1 N hydrochloric acid as described in SM 9510 (APHA 2005). Salt addition was not

229

necessary due to the salinity of the filtered marine water. Acid was added using an equilibration basin

230

instead of a fluid proportioned system as this was found to be easier to control. The elution of

231

viruses from the filters was conducted using US EPA 600/R-95/178. In brief, collected filters were held

232

at 4 °C until processing. Filters were eluted at the laboratory with 3.0% beef extract solution containing

233

glycine. The eluant was concentrated by organic flocculation, and the concentrate was assayed for total

234

culturable enteroviruses using BGM and MA104 cells as the host culture. Cultures were examined

235

periodically for 14 days post inoculation for cytopathic effect (CPE) development. During the incubation,

236

the media was changed regularly. Following the incubation period, the flasks were frozen at - 70 °C and

237

thawed rapidly at 37 °C for a total of two cycles. Ten percent of the media from each culture flask was

238

passaged onto a new (< 3 day) culture. These cultures were incubated and monitored for an additional 14

239

days . Samples were recorded based on cytopathic effect development as "positive" or "negative". For

240

samples demonstrating positive CPE, the most probable number (MPN) of infectious units per volume of

241

sample analyzed was calculated using EPA MPNCALC software. Positive and negative controls were

242

included in the analysis as per standard protocols.
