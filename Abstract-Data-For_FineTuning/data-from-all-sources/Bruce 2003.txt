Context: Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of hundreds of

strains of the gram-negative bacterium E coli, has been
implicated in numerous lake-borne outbreaks of infection during the past decade. In August 1999, several children who later became ill with E coli O157:H7 infection
reported swimming in a lake in Clark County, Washington. The lake was closed and an investigation begun.
Objectives: To identify the source of the outbreak and

determine risk factors for infection with E coli O157:H7.
Design, Setting, and Patients: Two case-control studies were performed among residents of and visitors to
Clark County in August 1999 by using community and
campground-registrant control subjects.
Main Outcome Measure: Risk factors for infection with

E coli O157:H7 among Clark County residents or visitors.
Results: We identified 37 case patients (including 29

primary-case patients) with a median age of 5 years (age
range, 1-14 years for primary-case patients). Eight children were hospitalized, 3 with hemolytic uremic syn-

drome; none died. With analysis restricted to primarycase patients, illness was strongly associated with
swimming in the lake (18 of 18 case patients vs 1 of 18
neighborhood-matched and age-matched control subjects; matched odds ratio undefined; P⬍.001). All primarycase patients were children younger than 15 years who
swam in the lake. Illness was associated with placing the
head underwater, getting lake water in the mouth, or swallowing lake water (26 of 27 case patients vs 43 of 62 control subjects; matched odds ratio=11.5; P=.005). Cultures of lake water yielded E coli O157:H7 that matched
the outbreak strain according to results of pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis.
Conclusions: To date, this is one of the largest documented outbreaks of E coli O157:H7 infection associated with unchlorinated recreational water and represents the first outbreak in which the strain was isolated
from lake water. Guidelines are needed to decrease the
risk of enteric illness associated with swimming in recreational lakes.

SCHERICHIA COLI O157:H7 is
a prominent cause of both
epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis in the United
States.1-5 Infection with E coli
O157:H7 can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a devastating and sometimes fatal
complication characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.1,6,7 In population studies, age-specific attack rates for hemolytic
uremic syndrome have been highest among
children younger than 5 years.8-11
The most common modes of transmission of E coli O157:H7 are ingestion
of contaminated food or water and personto-person spread.12,13 Occasionally, outbreaks due to E coli O157:H7 have occurred in association with swimming in
freshwater lakes, the ocean, or poorly chlorinated swimming pools.3-5,14-24 These outbreaks have predominantly affected chil-

dren and presumably occur as a result of
the swimmers’ inadvertent ingestion of water contaminated with feces of human or
animal origin (Table 1). In none of these
swimming-associated outbreaks have E coli
O157:H7 bacteria been identified in environmental samples.
In 1987, Washington was the first state
to mandate public health reporting of E coli
O157:H7 infections by physicians and diagnostic laboratories. All patients with reported cases were interviewed in depth and
questioned about possible sources of infection. Clinical laboratories in Washington State send all isolates of E coli O157:H7
to the Washington State Public Health
Laboratory (WPHL) for subtyping, and in
1995, the WPHL began to perform pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on all E coli
O157:H7 isolates.
In late August 1999, the number of
reported cases of E coli O157:H7 infec-

tion increased in Clark County in southwestern Washington. Initial interviews indicated that all cases occurred in children who swam in a popular recreational
lake in a nearby state park. An investigation was conducted to identify the extent of the outbreak and determine its source.
METHODS
BACKGROUND
Battle Ground Lake is a freshwater volcanic lake 28 acres
(11.3 hectares) in area that is fed by underwater springs that
flow through large lava tubes. There is a steep caldera rim surrounding the lake. The lake sits within Battle Ground Lake
State Park, a multiuse facility that includes campgrounds with
a capacity of 200, picnic areas, playgrounds, a concession
stand, a swimming area, and a boat launch for fishing and
pleasure craft. The swimming area comprises a shallow
swimming area for children (stagnant water ⱕ2 ft [0.6 m]
deep with a mud bottom) and an adult swimming area (ⱖ4 ft
[1.2 m] deep), with the total beach area measuring 125 ft
(38.1 m) long. The toilet facilities closest to the beach are 300 ft
(91.4 m) up the steep caldera rim. The park is visited by an
estimated 400 day users and 200 overnight campers on an average summer day; however, in August 1999, warm weather
and low precipitation levels were noted, and the park had as
many as 2500 weekend visitors.
DEFINITIONS AND CASE FINDING
We defined a case patient as any resident of or visitor to Clark
County with diarrhea onset after August 15, 1999, and either
isolation from stool of the outbreak strain of E coli O157:H7,
as determined by means of PFGE, or serologic diagnosis with
an IgM or IgG antibody titer of 1:320 or more. A case was defined as primary if there was no close contact with another case
patient in the 10 days before symptom onset and as secondary

if there was close contact with another case patient during this
period. Case patients were identified through routine laboratory and physician reports; telephone calls to the health department by physicians, laboratories, and the public after extensive news coverage; and telephone calls to persons who had
visited the state park between August 13 and August 28, 1999.
Once the outbreak was recognized, we encouraged area physicians and laboratories to consider E coli O157:H7 infection
and use appropriate cultures.
We interviewed all residents of or visitors to Clark County
with reported E coli O157:H7 infection and onset of diarrhea
after August 15, 1999. Serum samples were collected from persons who met all aspects of the case definition but from whom
stool samples were not available.
For primary-case patients, the incubation period was defined as the number of days between the swim date and the date
of symptom onset. When multiple swim dates were given, the
date closest to symptom onset was used.
CASE-CONTROL STUDIES
Two consecutive case-control studies were performed to determine risk factors for infection. Only primary-case patients were
included in this analysis. Using a standardized questionnaire administered by telephone, we obtained demographic and risk factor information from all case patients and control subjects (or their
parents). Because most cases were among children, control subjects were limited to children younger than 15 years. Parents of
children without symptoms were interviewed about their child’s
potential exposures, including lake water, drinking water, and
food consumption while at Battle Ground Lake State Park. They
were also asked about other potential exposures, such as consumption of undercooked meat, raw milk, and sprouts; contact
with diapered children; and handling livestock.
Community Control Subjects
An age-matched and neighborhood-matched case-control study
was performed in the Battle Ground municipal area. We per-

formed a 1:1 match for age (±1 year) and neighborhood to distribute these 2 potential confounding variables in an identical
manner among both groups. Telephone numbers were chosen
by using a forward-digit dialing protocol that involved dialing
the first 5 digits of the case patient’s 7-digit telephone number, then replacing the last 2 digits sequentially starting at 00,
then 01, and so on, up to 99 until neighborhood-matched and
age-matched control subjects were selected. Parents were interviewed about children without symptoms living in the household who were closest in age to the case patient. No child with
an episode of diarrhea in the preceding 3 weeks was included
as a control subject. If 2 children within the household matched
the age criterion, then the control subject closest in age to the
case patient was selected.

the remaining filter was placed in a modified trypticase soy broth
with agar.
Both clinical and environmental isolates were subcultured on appropriate media and incubated at 37°C overnight.
Genomic DNA from the isolates was prepared and analyzed with
the PFGE method described by Gautom.27
ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

LABORATORY INVESTIGATION

Environmental health specialists inspected the waste water systems closest to the swimming beach to assess their integrity and
placed fluorescein dye in these systems to look for leakage into
the swimming area. Operations and food-handling procedures
of the sole food concessionaire were reviewed. Drinking water
from water fountains near the swimming area was tested for evidence of fecal contamination by using a fluorescent reagent test
(Colilert; IDEXX Laboratories Inc, Westbrook, Me) on August
29, 1999. Before the identification of the outbreak, water from
the child and adult swimming areas of the lake was not routinely tested. However, after 2 children reported becoming ill after swimming at the lake, 2 samples of lake water were collected on August 26, 1999 (2 days before the outbreak was
identified and the lake closed) and tested for fecal coliforms by
using standard methods. Once the outbreak was identified, additional samples of lake water and sediment were collected on
August 29 and September 3, 1999, from multiple sites in and
around the child and adult swimming areas of the lake. All samples
were sent to the WPHL and tested for E coli O157:H7.

Clinical Isolates

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Standard procedures were followed at the WPHL for the recovery of E coli O157:H7 from clinical samples. Stool samples
from Cary-Blair transport medium were cultured on sorbitolMacConkey agar. Sorbitol-negative colonies were identified as
E coli O157:H7 by means of latex agglutination (E coli O157
Test Kit; Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, England) and confirmed biochemically. The flagellar antigen H7 was identified
by means of agglutination (RIM E coli O157:H7 Latex Kit; Remel Inc, Lenexa, Kan).
Serum specimens obtained by means of venipuncture were
sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga, and were assayed for antibodies to E coli O157:H7
lipopolysaccharide antigens as described elsewhere.25 Any IgM
or IgG titers of 1:320 or more were considered positive for E
coli O157:H7.

Univariate odds ratios and univariate matched odds ratios were
calculated by using commercially available software (Epi Info
version 6.04b; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
P values were 2-tailed, and values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.

Camper Control Subjects
The campground registration list, which included advance reservations, was used to identify another group of control subjects. Each telephone number on the list was called in an effort
to identify children with no diarrhea in the preceding 3 weeks
who were younger than 15 years and had either camped or spent
1 or more days at Battle Ground Lake State Park during the outbreak from August 13 through August 28, 1999. Any child who
had not been to the park during the outbreak or who had had a
diarrheal illness in the preceding 3 weeks was excluded.

Environmental Isolates
At the WPHL, 10-g sediment samples and 10-mL water samples
were incubated overnight at 42°C in A-1 broth. The initial concentration of A-1 broth was such that the addition of environmental samples did not reduce ingredient concentrations to less
than that of the standard medium. Immunomagnetic separation with beads coated with anti-O157:H7 (Dynabeads antiE.coli O157; Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) was performed on
overnight enrichments from A-1 broth and plated on tellurite
cefixime sorbitol-MacConkey agar. Typical E coli O157:H7 colonies were picked from tellurite cefixime sorbitol-MacConkey
agar plates and confirmed by using standard biochemicals and
latex agglutination. In addition to the A-1 method, lake water
samples were tested by using the standard membrane filtration procedure for drinking water.26 The total volume of water
filtered was 100 mL. Four filters were made: 1 was used after
the usual procedure with m-endo broth (Millipore Corp, Billerica, Mass), 2 were placed on selective plating media (tellurite cefixime sorbitol-MacConkey agar and Fluorocult E coli
O157:H7 agar [Merck & Co Inc, Darmstadt, Germany]), and

RESULTS

DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGIC FINDINGS
We identified 37 cases of E coli O157:H7 infection (35
culture confirmed, 2 serologically confirmed) (Figure 1).
All 29 primary-case patients had visited the lake from August 13 through August 28, 1999. Swim dates were available in 28 of the 29 primary-case patients; the median
incubation period from swim date to symptom onset was
3.5 days (range, 1-11 days). Median age in all case patients was 5 years (age range, 8 weeks to 39 years); all
primary-case patients were younger than 15 years.
Twenty-four case patients (65%) were male. Eight secondary cases occurred among household or other close
contacts. According to self-report, all 37 case patients had
diarrhea, 31 (84%) had abdominal cramps, 24 (65%) had
bloody diarrhea, 17 (46%) had nausea, 17 (46%) had fever, and 8 (22%) received antibiotics during their illness. Eight children were hospitalized, including 3 with
hemolytic uremic syndrome; none died.
EXCLUSION OF
POTENTIAL CONTROL SUBJECTS
Thirty-eight of 100 potential camper control subjects contacted were excluded because of diarrheal illness. No community control subjects reported diarrheal illness.

CASE-CONTROL STUDIES
Community Control Subjects
Of the 29 total primary cases identified in this outbreak,
18 case patients were available when the first casecontrol study was performed. In a matched univariate
analysis, illness was strongly associated with swimming
in the lake (18 of 18 case patients vs 1 of 18 neighborhoodmatched and age-matched control subjects; matched odds
ratio undefined; P⬍.001). No other risk factors were significantly associated with disease.
Camper Control Subjects
Of the 29 total primary cases identified in this outbreak,
27 case patients were available at the time that the second case-control study was performed. In a univariate
analysis, case patients were significantly more likely than
camper control subjects to have taken lake water into the
mouth (P = .002) and to have swallowed lake water
(P=.002). Case patients were also more likely to have put
their head underwater than were control subjects, although this difference was not statistically significant.
When all 3 water exposure variables were combined into
1, case patients were more likely than control subjects
to report at least 1 of the 3 (26 of 27 case patients vs 43
of 62 control subjects; matched odds ratio=11.5; P=.005).
They also tended to spend more time in the water than
did control subjects (P = .007) (Table 2).
BACTERIAL SUBTYPING

indistinguishable from one another.

cialists revealed an intact system functioning properly,
and fluorescein dye study results showed no evidence
of leakage into the swimming area. No irregularities
were detected in a review of operations and procedures
used by the food concessionaire. Drinking water
samples from water fountains near the swimming area
were negative for coliforms. The 2 samples of lake
water collected August 26, 1999, showed fecal coliform
levels at 18 and 93 organisms per 100 mL, which is less
than the Washington State regulatory standard of 100
organisms per 100 mL for recreational water quality.
The WPHL’s testing of lake water and sediment samples
collected September 3, 1999, from the children’s swimming area identified E coli O157:H7 in the sediment
sample. Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting with PFGE
of these environmental isolates revealed patterns that
exactly matched the outbreak pattern of the clinical isolates obtained from swimmers and their close contacts
(Figure 2). In addition, results of a separate laboratory
investigation at the University of Washington (Seattle)

COMMENT

This outbreak of 37 confirmed cases of E coli O157:H7
infection was caused by contamination of a freshwater
lake. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest documented outbreaks of E coli O157:H7 infection from unchlorinated recreational water.
Previous investigators have inferred that the dose
of E coli O157:H7 required to cause illness is low (⬍100
bacteria),16,29 and although the major reservoir is cattle
and other mammals, the organism can survive for lengthy
periods in the environment.30-32 Both these observations
are supported by the results of our investigation. Many
case patients reported inadvertent ingestion of small
amounts of lake water, which could result in a low infectious dose. In this outbreak, the exposures to the implicated lake among ill persons occurred during a 16day period, and the outbreak strain was recovered from
lake samples obtained 21 days after the first reported exposure, which indicates that the organism could have survived in the lake at least 3 weeks.
Our findings are limited by a lack of information
about the number of swimmers in the lake per day; therefore, we were unable to calculate attack rates. For the 28
primary-case patients from whom swim dates were available, 7 (25%) swam on August 19, 1999; including these
7 patients, 24 (86%) swam between August 19 and August 26, 1999, which implies a relatively high rate of contamination of the lake for these 8 days (Figure 3).
In both case-control studies, misclassification bias
could have occurred from parents inaccurately reporting their child’s exposure. Media coverage was intense
and may have contributed to recall bias. Sick control subjects were excluded to limit misclassification bias toward the null that could have occurred if persons with E
coli O157:H7 infection had been included in the control
group; however, persons with asymptomatic E coli

O157:H7 infection could have been classified as control
subjects, which would result in a misclassification bias
toward the null.
All primary cases occurred in children younger than
15 years, 3 of whom developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. In other reported lake-associated outbreaks of E
coli O157:H7, children have also been disproportionately affected.14-24
The source of contamination was likely the bathers
themselves. No agricultural sources of contamination were
identified, and illness was not associated with food or beverage exposures. Children may have contributed to contamination of the lake through fecal accidents or dirty
diapers. During the investigation, we received a report
about a feces-laden diaper having been rinsed in the lake
near the children’s swimming area. It is likely that E coli
O157:H7 from feces was introduced into the shallow still
water of the children’s swimming area sometime in the
early to middle part of August 1999 and that the organism survived for a time in the lake or was periodically
reintroduced via fecal accidents (Figure 1).
A possible contributing factor in this outbreak was
the lack of appropriate diaper-changing stations in the area.
Additionally, the distance of toilets from the beach was 300
ft (91.4 m), and the lack of nearby hand-washing facilities may have made it difficult for parents to take their children on bathroom breaks regularly and wash their hands
after using the toilet. Human fecal contamination has also
been suggested as the likely source of pathogens in other
swimming-associated outbreaks.14,15,18,24
Before the outbreak, lake water was not routinely
monitored. Testing of lake water after 2 children reported becoming ill and shortly before the lake was closed
revealed allowable levels of fecal coliforms. Results from
other outbreaks also illustrate that levels of indicator organisms may be within acceptable limits at the time swimmers acquire infection with E coli O157:H7.14,15,17 The US
Environmental Protection Agency has recently established guidelines for microbial quality in fresh recreational water, with E coli (monthly geometric mean ⬍126
organisms per 100 mL) or enterococci (monthly geometric mean ⬍33 organisms per 100 mL) as the preferred proxy
indicators in lieu of fecal coliforms (http://www.epa.gov
/waterscience/beaches/local/sum2.html). Numerous pathogens in addition to E coli O157:H7 have caused outbreaks of gastroenteritis and other syndromes associated
with swimming or wading in freshwater lakes, including
Shigella, Leptospira, viral agents, Cryptosporidium, and schistosomes that cause dermatitis.3-5
Lakes can become contaminated by a variety of
mechanisms, and although monitoring may contribute
to some level of safety, no freshwater lake should be considered risk free, even with intensive monitoring. Recognizing that complete safety in fresh recreational water cannot be ensured, the challenge is to minimize risk
so that families can continue to enjoy lake swimming.
Results of this investigation point out the need for guidelines to decrease the risk of transmission of infectious
diseases from recreational freshwater sources. Assessing the availability of enough convenient toilets, diaperchanging stations, and hand-washing facilities may be
more important than testing the water for microbes.

What This Study Adds
During the past decade, numerous outbreaks of infection with E coli O157:H7 have been reported in association with swimming in recreational water. This association has until now been made with epidemiologic
evidence alone.
Our investigation results demonstrated epidemiologic evidence implicating the lake, as well as laboratory evidence confirming the existence of a strain of E
coli O157:H7 in the lake that matched the clinical outbreak strain identified with PFGE. In addition, we were
able to determine specific risk factors associated with
swimming that may help in future prevention efforts.

The swimming area at the lake reopened 2 years after the outbreak after implementation of measures aimed
at reducing the possibility of recurrence. These measures included provision of toilets, hand-washing facilities, and stations for diaper changing in closer and more
accessible areas; prevention of children younger than 4
years from entering the lake; distribution of educational
pamphlets about healthy swimming; periodic monitoring of E coli; and improved surveillance through continued education of physicians and laboratories about the
importance of prompt disease reporting.
