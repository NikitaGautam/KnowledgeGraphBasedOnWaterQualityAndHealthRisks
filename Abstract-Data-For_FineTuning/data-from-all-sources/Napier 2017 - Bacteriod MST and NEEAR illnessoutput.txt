Abstract
Background: Fecal indicator bacteria used to assess illness risks in recreational waters (e.g., Escherichia coli,
Enterococci) cannot discriminate among pollution sources. To address this limitation, human-associated Bacteroides
markers have been proposed, but the risk of illness associated with the presence of these markers in recreational
waters is unclear. Our objective was to estimate associations between human-associated Bacteroides markers in
water and self-reported illness among swimmers at 6 U.S. beaches spanning 2003–2007.
Methods: We used data from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 12,060 swimmers surveyed about beach activities
and water exposure on the day of their beach visit. Ten to twelve days later, participants reported gastroinestinal,
diarrheal, and respiratory illnesses experienced since the visit. Daily water samples were analyzed for the presence
of human-associated Bacteroides genetic markers: HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, HumM2. We used model-based
standardization to estimate risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed whether the
presence of Bacteroides markers were modifiers of the association between general Enterococcus and illness among
swimmers using interaction contrast.
Results: Overall we observed inconsistent associations between the presence of Bacteroides markers and illness.
There was a pattern of increased risks of gastrointestinal (RD = 1.9%; 95% CI: 0.1%, 3.7%), diarrheal (RD = 1.3%; 95%
CI: -0.2%, 2.7%), and respiratory illnesses (RD = 1.1%; 95% CI: -0.2%, 2.5%) associated with BsteriF1. There was no
evidence that Bacteroides markers acted as modifiers of Enterococcus and illness. Patterns were similar when
stratified by water matrix.
Conclusions: Quantitative measures of fecal pollution using Bacteroides, rather than presence-absence indicators,
may be necessary to accurately assess human risk specific to the presence of human fecal pollution.

Background
Fecal contamination of waters used for drinking, shellfish harvesting, and recreation is an important public
health concern because of possible exposure to a wide
range of disease-causing microorganisms. For example,
an estimated 170 million enteric and respiratory illnesses
worldwide are attributed to swimming in polluted water
each year [1]. Water pollution comes from a variety of
point (e.g. sewage) and nonpoint (e.g. surface runoff,
wildlife, leaky septic systems) sources. Fecal indicator
bacteria (FIB) such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), fecal coliforms, and Enterococci are useful for monitoring water
quality because their presence has been associated with
fecal contamination and swimming-associated illness,
usually gastroenteritis [2–4]. These FIB have long been
used because they are non-pathogenic, are found in high
levels in sewage and feces, and can be correlated with
human health effects. However, because they are found
in both animal and human feces they cannot be used to
distinguish pollution sources [5].
Human fecal contamination is generally considered of
greater health risk than fecal contamination from nonhuman sources due to the high density and range of potentially pathogenic microorgansims that can be found
in sewage [6]. In particular, enteric viruses (e.g. Hepatitis
A virus, rotavirus, and norovirus), which do not readily
transmit infection to a host of a different species [7], are
often, but not always [8, 9], believed to be the primary
etiologic agent causing swimmer illness in epidemiologic
studies of US beaches and outbreaks [10–13]. Thus,
water with elevated concentrations of FIB resulting from
human sources are more likely to contain humanspecific pathogens [7] and pose a greater risk. Swimming
in fecally-contamined waters has been associated with
self-limiting enteric and respiratory illness but can also
lead to more severe illness that results in medical treatment, hospitalization, and/or lost days of school or work
[4, 8, 9].
Previous epidemiologic studies that reported an increased risk of gastroenteritis [2, 3, 14], respiratory illness [14, 15], ear ailments [15], or skin illness [14, 16,
17] among swimmers exposed to increasing FIB levels
relied on proximity to sewage effluent from wastewater
treatment plants as a proxy for human fecal water contamination but lacked water quality measures to confirm
the extent to which human fecal contamination impacted the beach on any given day. In recent years, microbial source tracking tools capable of distinguishing
human from animal fecal matter have been developed
and validated [5]. These tools include both hostassociated microbial genetic markers, such as those from
the genus Bacteroides, and rapid methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), for detection
of these markers. Bacteroides have been at the forefront

Page 2 of 15

of efforts to develop methods that target human sources
for a number of reasons [18]: their abundance in the gut
of warm-blooded animals [19], the existence of hostspecific strains, their high concentrations in sewage [20,
21], their poor survival for long periods in the environment [21], and their persistence during wastewater treatment compared to conventional indicators like E. coli.
Molecular methods for detection of highly humanassociated Bacteroides spp. have already been developed
and have proven robust [22].
Questions that remain to be answered include whether
these markers are associated with human illness and
whether they represent an improvement over general,
non-specific FIB in terms of characterizing risk. Although a few studies have investigated these relationships, they were limited in size and scope [10, 17, 23,
24]; this paper seeks to address this gap. The primary
objective of this study was to estimate the association
between four human-associated Bacteroides markers and
self-reported gastrointestinal (GI), diarrheal, and respiratory illness among swimmers at six U.S. marine and
freshwater beaches enrolled in the National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational
Water (NEEAR) study from 2003 to 2007. A secondary
objective was to determine whether these Bacteroides
markers modify the association between a general Enterococcus indicator and GI and respiratory illnesses.

Methods
Study design and participants

The present analysis used data from the NEEAR study, a
prospective cohort study conducted to determine relationships between water quality and swimmingassociated illnesses. We included 12,060 participants
who enrolled in the NEEAR studies at six beaches from
2003 to 2007, met our requirements for body immersion
water exposure, and reported incident enteric or respiratory illnesses.
The beaches were located within 7 miles of treated
sewage effluent discharges believed to impact beach fecal
contamination. They included four freshwater Great
Lakes beaches and two temperate marine beaches (Fig.
1; Table 1). Criteria for beach selection and data collection were described previously [2, 3, 25].
Briefly, adult visitors to the beaches on weekends and
holidays in summer completed a survey at enrollment
consisting of demographic information and pre-existing
illnesses for each household member. Upon departure,
these participants answered questions about water exposure (extent, time, duration and location) and other
beach activities, such as food and drink consumption
and contact with animals. A follow-up telephone interview was completed 10–12 days after the beach visit to
determine incident symptoms of gastrointestinal illness,

diarrhea, and respiratory illness each household member
experienced following the beach visit. Consistent with
previous reports [2, 3, 24, 26], “GI illness” referred to
any of the following: (1) diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in a
24-h period); (2) vomiting; (3) nausea with stomach
ache; or (4) nausea or stomach ache and interference
with regular activities (missed time from work/regular
activities due to illness). Diarrhea alone was also
assessed as a separate outcome. “Respiratory illness” referred to any two of the following: sore throat, cough,
runny nose, cold, or fever. Participants were ineligible if
they had already completed the study in the previous
28 days, were unaccompanied minors (<18 years), or did
not speak English or Spanish.
Because we were interested in illness resulting from
exposure to Bacteroides markers present in water, we restricted our analysis to participants reporting “body
immersion” to the waist or higher (i.e. swimmers). Of
the 25,288 NEEAR participants enrolled in the six beaches, 48% (n = 12,060) were body immersion swimmers
and 36% (n = 9091) reported no water contact (i.e. nonswimmers) (Additional file 1: Table S1). Compared to
non-swimmers, swimmers were younger (mean age
22.8 years vs. 35.5 years); disproportionately male (48%
vs. 37%); disproportionately Hispanic (13% vs. 10%);
travelled farther to the beach (mean of 45 miles vs.
38 miles); and reported more sand contact (56% vs.
21%). A quarter of both swimmers and non-swimmers
reported having a chronic illness at the beach interview
and few (≤6%) reported acute illnesses in the 3 days
prior to their beach visits. The amount of missing and
incomplete data was negligible (<5%). Participants
reporting water contact, but not “body immersion” were
excluded from analysis because they comprise a group
with heterogeneous water exposure. Other categories of
water exposure (i.e. head immersion, swallowed water)
were considered in sensitivity analyses described below.
Participants who became ill within the 3 days prior to
their beach visit were excluded from analysis of the outcome related to their baseline symptoms, but were eligible to be included in analyses of other outcomes.
For the original NEEAR study, procedures, questionnaires, protocols and consent process were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NEEAR
participants gave verbal informed consent. For the
present analysis, IRB exemption was granted by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as the dataset was
de-identified (# 13–2274).
Bacteroides exposure assessment and analysis

Exposure to human fecal contamination was assessed
using archived water samples, in which we determined
the concentration of four human-associated Bacteroides
markers: HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, and HumM2. Procedures for water sample collection and filtration for the
human-associated Bacteroides genetic markers have
been described elsewhere [2, 27]. Briefly, water samples
were collected three times per day (8:00 AM, 11:00 AM,
and 3:00 PM) along three transects perpendicular to the
shoreline. At each transect, 1 L of water was collected in
waist-high water (1 m deep) and 1 L of water was collected in shin-high water (0.3 m deep) for a total target
of 18 samples each day. After collection, samples were
maintained on ice at 1–4 °C in coolers for up to 6 h before polycarbonate membrane filtration. The filters were
kept at −20 °C, shipped on dry ice to EPA (Cincinnati,
OH), and stored at −40 °C for approximately two to 6
years before qPCR analysis. DNA was extracted from
the filters by a simple bead milling procedure and aliquots corresponding to two-thirds of the total crude extracts were concentrated 2-fold and purified using a
commercially available 96-well silica column based system (DNeasy, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with binding and
elution buffers from another system (DNA-EZ, GeneRite, North Brunswick, NJ) as previously described [28].
To determine the concentration of Bacteroides
markers present in water collected from the beaches,
purified DNA extracts were analyzed for Bacteroides
markers using four qPCR assays. QPCR assays targeting
16S rRNA gene markers of highly human-associated
Bacteroides species clusters included HF183 TaqMan
(hereafter HF183), BsteriF1, and BuniF2 [29] while the
HumM2 assay targets a gene encoding a hypothetical
protein potentially involved in remodeling surface lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides in other unidentified, highly human-associated Bacteroides species [30].
Among these assays, the HF183 and HumM2 assays



Napier et al. Environmental Health (2017) 16:103

have shown the greatest promise for human source
tracking due to their high sensitivity in detecting samples that are actually of human origin (e.g. human feces
and sewage) as well as their low or nondetectable crossreactivity with feces from other animals [5, 29–32]. The
BsteriF1 and BuniF2 assays have similarly shown high
human source sensitivity, but lower specificity due to
substantial cross-reactivity with feces from several animal groups including cats and dogs for BsteriF1 and
pigs, sheep and chickens for BuniF2 [30, 31]. In addition,
total Bacteroides genetic markers were also analyzed as
indicators of general, nonsource-specific fecal pollution
using the GenBac3 qPCR assay [33]. Details of qPCR
amplification conditions, including blanks, are described
in the Supplement. Out of a total of 2422 initial water
samples, 2336 samples passed quality control measures.
We were unable to calculate an average daily concentration for each Bacteroides marker due to limited detectable values and prolonged storage of samples, both
of which had an unknown effect on the accuracy of the
quantifed amount. Instead, we dichotomized exposure as
present (detected in ≥2 samples/day) or absent (detected
in 0–1 sample/day). Though we lost some detail by dichotomizing this way, it allowed us to maximize our
sample size. Dichotomizing exposure conventionally
with presence defined as being detected in ≥1 sample/
day would have resulted in small numbers over a number of days and therefore unstable effect estimates.
Confounders

We used directed acyclic graphs [34] (visualized using
DAGity [35]) to evaluate potential confounding factors
plausibly associated with poor water quality and illness.
The final models included age (0–4, 5–11, 12–19, 20–
34, ≥35), beach (categorical: Fairhope, Goddard, Huntington, Silver, West, Washington Park), mean number
of bathers (continuous), rainfall totals from 3:00 PM the
previous day to 8:00 AM on the current day (continuous), sand exposure (binary where 1 = digging in sand
or burying body in sand), and, for GI illness and diarrhea, water temperature (continuous). Indicator variables
representing beach were included in all models to control for differences in baseline illness among beaches.
Robust standard errors were calculated to account for
dependence of observations within a household [36].
Statistical analysis

The association between exposure to each Bacteroides
marker (HumM2, HF183, BsteriF1, and Bunif2) and selfreported illness was investigated using multivariable regression models adjusted for potential confounders. We
used model-based standardization [37–39] to estimate
standardized marginal risks, risk differences (RD), and
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using the total group

Page 4 of 15

as the standard. Standard errors for the CI were computed using the delta method [40]. Logistic regression
was used to estimate predicted probabilities of the outcome for every value of observed confounders and then
combined as a weighted average separately for both
levels of the binary exposure. The predicted probabilities
were subtracted to produce a marginal estimate of the
risk difference comparing Bacteroides marker exposure
to no exposure. Modification of the Bacteroides-illness
effect estimates by water matrix (freshwater vs. marine)
was assessed by stratification.
To investigate the secondary objective of whether the
presence of Bacteroides markers of human fecal contamination strengthened the previously-observed association
between general, nonsource-specific Enterococcus (qPCR
Method 1611 [41] and culture Method 1600 [42]) and
illness [2, 3], we estimated RD modification with product
interactions of Enterococcus and Bacteroides markers
and then assessed for it with an interaction contrast
[43]. The interaction contrast is zero when the joint effects of two factors are simply additive [43]. For these
analyses, Enterococcus was the main effect and the binary Bacteroides marker was the modifier. We dichotomized quantitated values of Enterococcus according to
2012 EPA recreational water quality guidelines for fresh
and marine water. Assuming an illness rate of 36/1000
recreators, the threshold is a geometric mean (GM) of
470 calibrator cell equivalents (CCE)/100 ml for qPCR
or a GM of 35 colony forming units (CFU)/100 ml for
culture Method 1600. Assuming an illness rate of 32/
1000 recreators, the threshold is a GM of 300 CCE/
100 ml for qPCR or a GM of 30 CFU/100 ml for culture
[44]. Enterococcus densities above these guidelines necessitate remedial action, whether beach advisory, closure, or other actions, and so were a practical choice for
a binary value. RD modification analyses were also performed with Enterococcus coded continuously (average
log10 count of Enterococcus CCE/100 ml per day).
We investigated the robustness of our estimates
through sensitivity analyses that tested alternate ways of
classifying swimming and Bacteroides exposure. First, we
repeated our analyses using two additional definitions of
swimmer: as participants who reported immersing their
head under water, and participants who reported swallowing water. Second, we explored alternate exposure
classifications since our primary one did not take into
account intensity (i.e. cannot distinguish between situations when Bacteroides is detected in 10 vs. 2 samples
per day). We therefore explored exposure defined as a
count of the number of Bacteroides markers detected in
≥2 samples/day: 0 if none of the four markers were detected in ≥2 samples/day, 1 if one of the four markers
were detected in ≥2 samples/day, 2 if two of the markers
were detected, and so on up to 4. We also explored



Napier et al. Environmental Health (2017) 16:103

binary exposure with presence defined conventionally as
being detected in ≥1 sample/day.
All analyses were completed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results
Descriptive characteristics of NEEAR participants by
body immersion status are provided in Additional file 1:
Table S1.
The percent of water samples with human-associated
Bacteroides markers that were detected, below the limit
of detection (undetected), and missing are shown in
Table 2 along with the false positive rate for each
marker. While human-associated Bacteroides markers
were detected at every beach, the frequency of markers
varied widely by beach and by assay (Fig. 2). Silver and
Goddard Beaches had the highest frequencies of

Fig. 1 Freshwater and marine beach sites

Page 5 of 15

detection, regardless of marker, while Fairhope Beach
had the lowest. Regardless of beach, BuniF2 and BsteriF1
markers were generally detected more frequently than
HF183 and HumM2. For BuniF2, the proportion of detects ranged from 15% (Fairhope) to 63% (Silver) of samples; for BsteriF1, the range was 11% (Fairhope) to 46%
(Goddard). HF183 markers were detected in between 4%
(Fairhope) and 49% (Silver) of samples. HumM2 markers
were detected least often across all beaches, with 2%
(Fairhope) to 17% (Silver) of samples testing positive.
General, nonspecific Bacteroides were detected in neary
all (>98%) samples tested using the GenBac3 assay.
Overall, the frequency of non-detection among the
markers ranged from 58% (BuniF2) to 90% (HumM2)
(Table 2).
Frequencies and standardized marginal estimates of
the RD (95% CI) for illness comparing presence of each
Bacteroides marker to its absence are shown in Fig. 3

and Additional file 1: Table S2a-c. When the BsteriF1
marker was present, swimmers had approximately 2%
more GI illness than when it was absent (RD = 1.9%
(0.1%, 3.7%)). Smaller and less precise risks of approximately 1% were observed for diarrhea and respiratory illness (RD = 1.3% (−0.2%, 2.7%) and RD = 1.1% (−0.2%,
2.5%), respectively). Detection of the Bunif2 marker was
also associated with an increased risk of GI illness of almost 2% as well (18 per 1000 swimmers), and HF183
with increased risk of respiratory illness by 8 per 1000
swimmers. None of the associations with HumM2 and
HF183 were consistently positive. Similar patterns were
seen when fresh and marine water were examined separately with the exception of BuniF2. Detection of Bunif2
in freshwater was associated with greater magnitude of
risks for all three outcomes: of 25 per 1000, 18 per 1000
and 27 per 1000 swimmers for GI, diarrhea, and respiratory, respectively; for marine beaches, associations with
Bunif2 were less precise and closer to the null than fresh
water estimates.
Tables 3 and 4 show RDs and 95% CI for the association of Enterococcus assessed continuously (by qPCR
and culture Method 1600, respectively) and illness modified by each Bacteroides marker. As shown previously by
Wade et al. [2, 3], we saw a 1.4% and 1.1% increased risk
of GI illness and diarrhea with each 1-log10 increase in
Enterococcus measured by qPCR (RD = 1.4% (0.6%,

Fig. 2 Proportion of Bacteroides samples detected by beach

2.3%) and RD = 1.1% (0.6%, 1.7%), respectively). However, RD estimates did not differ when each Bacteroides
marker was present vs. absent and interaction contrast
estimates were imprecise overall. For one marker
(Bunif2) an inverse modification was observed (i.e., the
association between Enterococcus and illness was attenuated when Bunif2 was present) but no consistent patterns of effect modification were observed. RD estimates
for Enterococcus assessed dichotomously and illness did
not vary by any Bacteroides marker (Additional file 1:
Table S3–6).
There was no significant evidence of modification
judged by the interaction contrast when analyses were
restricted to marine beaches, but there was a pattern of
increasing risk of GI illness in the presence vs. absence
of HF183, BsteriF1 and BuniF2 when Enterococcus was
measured by qPCR (Additional file 1: Table S7–8).
Sensitivity analyses for alternate count and binary exposure categorizations and alternate swimmer definitions showed little evidence of association between
Bacteroides markers and illness. While we found no
clear dose-response pattern in which the presence of
more Bacteroides markers would lead to greater incidence of illness, the greatest risk of illness appeared to
occur when 2 or 3 of the four Bacteroides markers were
detected (Additional file 1: Table S9a-c). Estimates using
the more obvious binary categorization of exposure—as

8 am present day). CI, confidence interval; GI, gastrointestinal illness; RD, risk difference

0 (absent) vs. 1 or more samples (present)—were more
imprecise and unstable compared to the binary
categorization used in our main analysis above. This
may be due to the fact that there were few days when
HF183 and BuniF2 markers in particular were not detected in any samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). When

restricted to participants who had immersed their head
in water (Additional file 1: Table S10), findings were
consistent to those described above but less precise,
while findings from participants who swallowed water
(Additional file 1: Table S11) were generally farther from
the null, and less precise.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether the presence of
human-associated Bacteroides markers were associated
with self-reported GI, diarrheal, and respiratory illness
among swimmers in order to determine whether
human-associated markers could be useful indicators of
fecal contamination at recreational beaches. We report
inconsistent associations between the presence of
human-associated Bacteroides markers and illness,
though positive patterns with GI, diarrhea, and respiratory illnesses associated with BsteriF1 detection were observed. We did not detect evidence that Bacteroides
markers modified the association between the nonsource-specific general indicator Enterococcus and illness; however in marine waters there was a pattern of
an increased GI illness risk in the presence of HF183,
BsteriF1 and BuniF2 when Enterococcus was measured
by qPCR.
Human-associated Bacteroides markers were hypothesized to be predictors of swimming-associated

illness because of the human pathogens likely in human fecal matter. Of the patterns we identified, positive associations between the BsteriF1 and, to a lesser
extent, BuniF2 markers and GI, diarrhea, and respiratory illness are potentially informative. The BsteriF1
and BuniF2 assays have shown high sensitivity in detecting samples that are actually of human origin (e.g.
human feces and sewage). However, they also have
lower specificity than HF183 and HumM2 due to
substantial cross-reactivity with animal feces including
cats and dogs for BsteriF1 and pigs, sheep, and chickens for BuniF2 [30, 31]. It is uncertain why these
markers performed better than HF183 and HumM2,
but one possible reason is that BsteriF1 and Bunif2
were detected more frequently than HF183 and
HumM2.
Overall, we observed weaker and more inconsistent
associations between illness and Bacteroides markers
than we expected, especially with HF183 and
HumM2. There are several possible explanations for

this, related to both biological and uncontrollable factors inherent to the study. The first possibility is that
human-associated Bacteroides markers may be less
persistent than general Enterococcus markers in the
environment. Several studies have reported that general Enterococcus and Bacteroides qPCR markers such
as Entero1a, GenBac3, and AllBac, persist longer than
human-associated microbial source tracking genetic
markers, detected by the HF183 [45, 46], HumM2
[46], BacHum [45, 47], and BuniF2 [48] assays. These
studies suggest that human-associated markers are
most useful as indicators of recent human fecal contamination. If, as suggested by other studies, viral
pathogens are also relatively persistent [47, 49], this
may explain why health associations were previously
established with the general markers, but not among
the human associated Bacteroides markers examined
in this study.
A second possibility is that the densities of the human
markers may have been impacted by the long-term

freezer storage of the samples at −40 °C. Other analyses
have indicated that the densities of Enterococci and general Bacteroides markers in these archived samples were
significantly reduced in comparison to the originally analyzed NEEAR study samples [50]. Because of this, we
did not use quantitative estimates of the human markers
and instead classified exposure as presence-absence. It is
possible this approach reduced the study power to detect
associations due to misclassification of exposure (e.g.
high exposures were considered the same as low exposures). However, we report results of sensitivity analyses
restricted to marine beaches that had a higher correlation between the original and archived sample values of
general Bacteroides indicator GenBac3, [50], which
yielded similar findings to our main analysis.
A third possibility for our findings is that the humanassociated Bacteroides markers in this study were often
undetected. Among the four assays, from 58% to 90% of
all samples were negative for the tested Bacteroides
markers. These factors prompted our use of the



Napier et al. Environmental Health (2017) 16:103

presence-absence approach for data analysis, which may
have limited our ability to estimate associations, as discussed above. Findings were similar when using a categorical exposure definition in a sensitivity analysis
although risk estimates did improve with use of multiple
markers. Low target densities and frequencies also contributed to the finding of no association in a previous
study of health risks and human-associated markers; in a
study of 8797 visitors to a nonpoint source beach in
California, Colford et al. [23] concluded that the association between illness and human-specific viruses adenovirus 40, 41 and norovirus could not adequately be
evaluated because the viruses were rarely detected.
Finally, it is possible that the level of non-specific fecal
contamination may have been so high that the addition
of a human marker did not add any additional information to the estimation of illness risk. This analysis was
performed at beaches with known human sewage inputs
and general Bacteroides was detected in >98% of samples, indicating that fecal contamination was present at
all beaches throughout the study period. In beaches with
lower levels of overall fecal contamination or at sites
without a known source of sewage contamination, perhaps human markers would be more informative.
To the best of our knowledge, our study represents
the largest effort to date investigating human-associated
fecal markers and risk of illness, and the first conducted
in settings where disinfected effluent is the primary pollution source. Findings from three smaller previous studies reported no association, though each used assays
targeting different human-associated markers and all
were conducted at nonpoint source marine beaches. In a
prospective cohort study of 5674 people in an urban
runoff-impacted California beach, Arnold et al. reported
that Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis
densities were not consistently associated with swimmer
illness [10] using the Scorpion-2 qPCR assay. Similarly,
the previously mentioned Colford et al. [23] study of
8797 beachgoers at a different California beach found no
association between human-specific viruses and illness,
while Sinigalliano et al. [17] found no association with
the HF8 and UCD Bacteroides markers in a study of
1303 people randomized to water exposure on a South
Florida beach impacted by people, dogs, birds, and heavy
rainfall. However, in a runoff-impacted study at Doheny
beach in California, exposure to human fecal contamination measured by the Scorpion-2 Enterococcus qPCR
marker was associated with an increased risk of enteric
illness in 9525 individuals [24]. Our findings may help
inform this limited evidence base of studies investigating
human-associated bacterial fecal indicators and human
illnesses. The positive patterns of association we found
between the BsteriF1 markers and GI, diarrhea, and respiratory illness are novel findings, and may indicate that

Page 12 of 15

human markers are indeed associated with illness. Confirming an association necessitates future studies investigating HF183, HumM2, BsteriF1, and BuniF2. Such
studies would be strengthened by conducting timely
enumeration of Bacteroides marker densities by qPCR
following water collection. If possible, larger samples
may be needed to determine the disease risk of less
prevalent outcomes and potentially less abundant
human-associated Bacteroides markers.
Though few studies have investigated health risks from
human-associated fecal indicators, numerous studies
have demonstrated an increased risk of GI, diarrheal, respiratory, skin, eye, and ear illnesses among swimmers
exposed to elevated general FIB levels [2, 3, 14, 25,
51–53]. These studies demonstrated the value of fecal
indicators and many relied on proximity to sewage effluent as a proxy for human presence. Findings have
been less consistent for studies in which the predominant contaminants come from nonpoint sources.
Some have identified associations between illness and
bacteria or viruses [14, 16, 17, 24, 54], while others
have not [23, 24]. However it is possible that a human source of fecal contamination may have been
nearby even with nonpoint source beaches [14]. A
strength of our study is that it did not rely on a
proxy; instead, fecal contamination source was directly assessed from the water via the Bacteroides
markers. Also, because Bacteroides are among the
most dominant bacteria in the human gut [19], they
have been at the forefront of efforts to develop
methods that target human sources. This approach
may be of particular interest for investigating water
bodies impacted by nonpoint sources.
Several issues limit the findings of our study. We relied on measures of daily average water quality as a
proxy for an individual swimmer’s exposure. Although
these average daily measures may not be indicative of individual exposures, characterizing individual exposures
would have been prohibitively difficult. Body immersion
swimmers entered the water at multiple time periods
and locations and were exposed for varying durations of
time (mean duration = 65 min, range: 5–125 min). The
study design allowed for the collection of water samples
three times a day (8:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM), at
two water depths (shin (0.3 m) and waist height
(1.0 m)), and three beach locations to capture the variety
of fecal indicator exposures a participant may experience
in the water. The design also incorporated water quality
measurements over a wide range of study days, so we
were able to capture varying water quality conditions.
Additionally, a common limitation of this type of largescale study of water quality is the reliance on selfreported, non-specific symptoms and signs that may
have obscured more specific effects of fecal indicators.



Napier et al. Environmental Health (2017) 16:103

However, the 10 to 12 day follow-up period reflected the
incubation time for likely pathogens that would cause
the symptoms of interest. Furthermore, by using selfreported outcomes, we captured the diversity of symptoms potentially associated with recreational water exposure. While the outcomes may have been affected by
recall bias, it is unlikely that recall would be differential
by varying levels of water quality. In the future, investigators may be able to use non-invasive, objective measures of illness such as multiplex saliva assays to
examine the immunoprevalence of pathogens in a population [55].

Conclusions
Positive patterns with GI illness and diarrhea were noted
with the presence of BsteriF1 and BuniF2, but neither
these nor other human-associated markers positively improved the association of general indicators already in
use at beach sites impacted by sewage effluent. Other
human-associated Bacteroides markers were inconsistently associated with swimming-associated illness.
Quantitative measures, rather than a presence-absence
categorization, may more accurately characterize the associations between human markers of fecal contamination and swimming associated illness risk.
