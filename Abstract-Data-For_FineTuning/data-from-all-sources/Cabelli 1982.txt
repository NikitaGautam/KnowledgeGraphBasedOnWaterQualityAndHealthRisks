A direct, linear relationship between swimming-associated gastrointestinal
illness and the quality of the bathing water was obtained from a multi-year,
multiple-location prospective epidemlologlc-microblologic research program
conducted in New York City, 1973-1975, Lake Pontchartraln, Louisiana, 19771978, and Boston, Massachusetts, 1978. Several mlcrobial Indicators were
used In attempting to define the quality of the water; and, of those examined,
enterococci showed the best correlation to total and "highly credible" gastrointestinal symptoms. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms also had
a high degree of association with distance from known sources of municipal
wastewater. A striking feature of the relationship was the very low enterococcus and Eacherlchla coll densities In the water (10/100 ml) associated
with appreciable attack rates (about 10/1000 persons) for "highly credible"
gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, the ratio of the swimmer to nonswimmer
symptom rates indlpated that swimming In even marginally polluted marine
bathing water is a significant route of transmission for the observed gastroenteritis.
gastroenteritis; swimming; water microbiology

In an earlier report (1), the authors
presented evidence from a prospective
epidemiologic-microbiologic study that
there are measurable health effects associated with swimming in sewagepolluted waters. In some cases, these effects were observed even in waters that
were in compliance with existing recreational water quality guidelines and stan-

dards (2). The swimming-associated illness observed was an acute, relatively
benign gastroenteritis which had a short
incubation period and duration. The accompanying symptoms, as pointed out in
another report (3), suggested that the
etiologic agent might be the human
rotaviruses or Norwalk-like viruses. The
water-related nature of one of these
agents, the Norwalk-like virus, recently
has been confirmed in a shellfish-assoc iated outbreak of gastroenteritis in

when Stevenson (6) and Moore (7) obtained seemingly contradictory results.
Therefore, studies similar to those reported for New York City beaches (8, 9)
were conducted at two other locations in
the United States: Lake Pontchartrain,
Louisiana and Boston, Massachusetts.
The results obtained at these two sites
were essentially the same as those found
in the New York City study.
This report describes the quantitative
relationship of the swimming-associated
gastroenteritis to the mean enterococcus
density of the water as obtained from all
the epidemiologic-microbiologic studies
conducted in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study sites. Studies were conducted at
three general locations: New York City
(beaches on Coney Island and the Rockaways) in 1973-1975; Lake Pontchartrain,
Louisiana (Levee Beach and Fontainbleau Beach) in 1977 and 1978; and Boston, Massachusetts (Revere Beach and
Nahant Beach) in 1978. The beaches were
chosen because they were near large metropolitan areas and, hence, used by large
numbers of individuals who swam on
weekends but not during midweek days.
This was an essential requirement of the
experimental design for reasons to be
given.
The sources of pollution reaching the
beaches in the New York City study were
reasonably well defined as those emerging from the mouth of the Hudson River.
They were less defined in the Boston
study, and least defined in the Lake
Pontchartrain study. Moreover, in order
to determine which, if any, symptoms or
groups of symptons were both swimmingassociated and pollution-related (a major
objective of the first two years of the
New York City study), a relatively unpolluted beach at the Rockaways was
paired with a barely acceptable beach
on Coney Island. The latter was adjacent
to a beach area classified by local au-

607

thorities as unsafe for swimming. The
paired beaches were also chosen so that
they would have demographically similar
populations. The results obtained with
reference to this objective of the New
York City study have been published (1).
Study design. A prospective cohort design was used in all the studies. The essential features of the design, which have
been described previously (1, 9, 10), are
as follows:
1. Discrete trials were conducted only
on Saturdays and Sundays. Potential participants were recruited at the beach, preferably as family groups. Trials were limited to weekend days to maximize the size
of the beachgoing population, especially
the portion that comes to the beach only
on weekends. By excluding from the study
those individuals who swam in the five
midweek days before and after the
weekend in question or at other locations
on either weekend day, exposure to bathing water was limited to that at the
specific beach during a single day, or two
days at the most. This decreased the confounding effect of beach-to-beach and
day-to-day variability in pollution levels
on the illness-pollution relationships
sought. In addition, it allowed the analyses of the data by trials (study days) or
by groups of trials when the pollution
levels as indicated by the mean indicator
densities in the water were similar.
2. Demographic information was obtained at the initial beach interview and
during the subsequent telephone followup survey. The information included age,
sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status,
as determined from a persons-to-rooms
ratio.
3. Information on bathing activity was
obtained at the initial beach interview.
Swimming was stringently defined as
complete exposure of the head to the
water. This characteristic was determined by direct inquiry and by observation, i.e., whether or not the hair of the
subject was wet. Individuals who did not

immerse their heads in the water were
considered nonswimmers. The validity of
the respondents' information on bathing
activity was evaluated at the New York
City beaches in 1972 by comparing their
responses to information collected by
teams of observers. Good agreement was
obtained with regard to immersion of the
head in the water, but not the duration of
immersion or even the time spent in the
water with the head not necessarily immersed. Recruitment of the participants
at the beach as family groups and their
designation as swimmers and nonswimmers provided a nonswimming but beachgoing control (cohort) population which,
in general, came from the same family
groups as the swimmers.
4. One or two days after the initial contact, participating families were sent a
reminder letter asking them to note any
illnesses that might occur in the week following the beach activity. In the first year
(1973) (pretest) of the New York City
study, a telephone number was provided
so that follow-up medical or laboratory
examinations could be obtained by individuals with subsequent illnesses. Very
few individuals called the number, and
this approach toward confirming the reported symptomatology was abandoned.
A substitute for the approach is described
below.
5. Eight to 10 days after the initial
beach interview, the participants were
contacted by telephone and information
on symptomatology and demographic
characteristics was obtained. Participants
were questioned about gastrointestinal,
respiratory, "other" and disabling symptomatology. The categorized symptoms
are shown in table 1. Follow-up inquiries
for information on a variety of symptoms
were consistent with another requirement of the experimental design, that no
prejudgment would be made as to which
are the "important" illnesses, diseases or
symptoms. In fact, only gastrointestinal
symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, nausea or

stomachache) were consistently both
swimming-associated and pollutionrelated (1, 9). Therefore, only gastrointestinal symptomatology was examined relative to the indicator densities in the bathing water. Disability was estimated by
asking whether the respondents remained home, remained in bed or sought
medical advice. Hospitalization was not
reported by any of the subjects, and the
observation period was too short to identify illness with long incubation periods.
6. As an alternative to follow-up medical and laboratory examinations, the credibility of the information obtained on
gastrointestinal symptomatology was
confirmed by comparing the rates and
trends for total gastrointestinal symptoms to those in a subset designated
"highly credible." Highly credible gastrointestinal symptoms included all cases
of vomiting, instances of diarrhea that
were accompanied by a fever or that were
disabling, or cases of nausea or stomachache that were accompanied by a fever.
Henceforth, highly credible gastrointes-

formulae, the r and p values and 95 per
cent confidence limits for the lines are
shown in figure 2. These relationships
predict the illness rates from the mean
enterococcus densities.
The relative importance of swimming
in sewage-polluted water as a route of
transmission for enteric illness was determined by examining the ratio of
swimmer to nonswimmer gastroenteritis
rates against the mean enterococcus density. It was assumed that all the cases acquired by all the routes other than swimming in sewage-polluted waters were included in the nonswimmer rates. The
regression lines obtained for the trials
clustered by indicator densities are shown
in figure 3. It can be seen that the rates

for both total and highly credible gastrointestinal symptoms were equal at a mean
enterococcus density of about 17100 ml. At
a level of 10/100 ml, the rates for total and
highly credible gastrointestinal symptoms were 1.5 times for swimmers and
twice those for nonswimmers, respectively. The higher ratios for highly credible than for total gastrointestinal symptoms are of interest because of their implications concerning the reliability of the
respondents' information to the illness
queries.
DISCUSSION

The results clearly show that the risk of
gastroenteritis associated with swimming
in marine waters impacted with municipal wastewaters is related to the quality
of the water as indexed by the mean enterococcus density in the water. More-

FIGURE 2. Regression of swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GD symptom rates on the mean enterococcus densities in the water Data are from all US studies. The 95 per cent confidence limits (CL) for the
lines are as shown. The slopes, intercepts, r andp values for GI symptoms are, respectively, 24 2, -5.1, 0.82
and <0 001. For highly credible GI symptoms, they are, respectively, 12 2, 0.2, 0 75 and <0.001.

over, the risk is detectable at extremely
low levels of pollution. According to the
criteria suggested by Hill (19), there is
a strong suggestion of causality. First,
the association is a good one; in some
trials, the swimming-associated gastroenteritis rate was three to four times
greater than the nonswimming rate.
Second, there was a consistency in the
association in that it was observed at
multiple locations over multiple years.
Third, the association between enteric
disease and fecal contamination is a reasonable one by its very nature. Fourth,
the association is a coherent one since
there is a precedent for such a relationship by other waterbome routes of transmission, i.e., in shellfish (20) and potable
water (21).
It was also understandable that, of the
indicators examined, enterococcus den-

sities in the water correlated best with
the rates for the swimming-associated
gastroenteritis. The two salient indicator
characteristics required for the specific
association obtained are a consistent fecal
source and "good" survival during sewage
treatment and transport in the aquatic
environment. Of the indicators examined,
enterococci and E. coli best satisfy the
first requirement (22, 23); and, of the two,
enterococci have the best survival characteristics (24), although their densities in
raw or treated sewage are 1-2 orders of
magnitude less than those of E. coli (25).
These two differences are consistent with
those observed in the slopes andX axis intercepts of the regression lines for the two
indicators. That is, the slopes of the regression lines should become shallower
and the lines should cross the X axis at
lower indicator densities as the survival

characteristics of the indicator become
poorer relative to those of the etiologic
agent(s).
There are two implications from the
finding of rather high gastroenteritis rates
(1 per cent) associated with the ingestion
of one to five enterococci (the accidental
ingestion of 10-15 ml of water (26) whose
enterococcus density was about 10/100
ml). The first is that even enterococci
may not survive as well as the etiologic
agent for the gastroenteritis. The second
is that the agent must be present in the
bathing waters and, hence, municipal
wastewaters in very large numbers, be
highly infectious, survive very well in
the marine environment or, most probably, a combination of all three.
The analysis of the ratios of the swimmer to nonswimmer gastroenteritis rates
would suggest that, for individuals of
"swimming age," swimming in sewagepolluted waters is not an insignificant
route of transmission for the disease.
Moreover, the risk of gastroenteritis is

present even at relatively low pollution
levels, as seen from the indicator densities. The higher ratio of the swimmer
to nonswimmer rates observed with
highly credible as opposed to total gastrointestinal symptoms suggests that
nausea, stomachache and even diarrhea
are disproportionately reported by nonswimmers. This, in turn, suggests that
the swimming-associated rates for total
gastrointestinal symptoms are underestimated.
Finally, the finding of swimmingrelated rates of gastroenteritis associated
with very low indicator densities, i.e., the
ingestion of one to five enterococci, has
some interesting implications with regard
to the existence of sporadic cases of this
illness by the other potential waterassociated routes of transmission, e.g.,
shellfish, drinking water and even aerosols generated from municipal sewage
and its receiving waters. These possibilities should be pursued by prospective
epidemiologic investigations.
