In most industrialized countries, Campylobacter organisms are, along with Salmonella organisms, the most
common cause of foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis [1,
2]. Previous studies have shown that Campylobacter infection is frequently acquired through consuming undercooked poultry and other meats, drinking untreated
water, having contact with pets or farm animals, and
traveling abroad [3–10]. Even if there is evidence that
cross-contamination between raw meat and other foods
during meal preparation is responsible for a consequent

Background. To better document the risk factors for sporadic Campylobacter infection in France, we conducted
a national case-control study from September 2002 to June 2004.
Methods. Cases with confirmed Campylobacter infection were sampled through the national surveillance laboratory network. Cases and controls who were matched for age, as well as attending physicians, were interviewed about
foods consumed, food preparation practices, travel history, contact with cases and animals during the 8 days before
the onset of infection, and any antibiotic use occurring during the 30 days before onset. Matched odds ratios [ORs]
were calculated using conditional logistic regression and multiple imputation methods.
Results. A total of 285 pairs of cases and matched controls were enrolled. “Ate undercooked beef” (OR, 2.86; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.65– 4.95), “ate at restaurant” (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.23–3.93), and “poor utensils hygiene in
the kitchen” (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.33–3.37) were the main independent risk factors for infection. Cases infected with
a ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter jejuni strain were more likely than controls to have used antibiotics in the
month before onset.
Conclusion. Good hygiene practices in the kitchen remain a strong recommendation to avoid crosscontamination. However, studies are needed to explore the mechanism of contamination throughout the food chain.
The use of antibiotics in humans may favor the development of a resistant infection.
number of cases, this factor has not been identified in
epidemiologic studies [5–7, 9, 11–13]. In addition, what
were identified as risk factors in some studies were found
to be protective factors in others, even in studies performed in the same country [14]. The specific immunity
conferred by Campylobacter infection suggests that susceptibility should vary by age and exposure [15]. Because of their inability to multiply in food products,
Campylobacter organisms have a low outbreak potential;
however, they have been responsible for several large
outbreaks, most of them waterborne [16 –19].
Campylobacter infection is usually self-limited, but extraintestinal infection or septicemia may occur and may
require treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Since the
beginning of the 1990s, the resistance of Campylobacter organisms to antibiotics has increased. Epidemiologic studies, modeling, and experimental studies have documented
a strong association between the increase in resistance to
quinolones/fluoroquinolones in human isolates and the
use of these antibiotics in animals [20 –22].

Surveillance of Campylobacter infection was expanded in 2002
in France to monitor the incidence of and trends associated with
bacterial resistance of Campylobacter infection [23, 24]. So far,
very little information has been available on risk factors in
France. We therefore performed a prospective case-control
study of sporadic Campylobacter infection among French residents.

RESULTS
Study population. During the 21-month study, 2743 patients
with culture-confirmed Campylobacter infection were notified.
Of the 954 cases (34.8%) sampled, 285 (29.9%) were included in
the study. Cases that were excluded (n ⫽ 669) included 15 cases
with an undetermined date of onset, 285 with a notification delay of ⬎10 days from the date of onset, 174 who could not be

Study design. A “case” was defined as a resident of metropolitan France who had clinical symptoms of campylobacteriosis
(i.e., gastroenteritis, systemic infection, or extradigestive infections) and a culture-confirmed Campylobacter isolate identified,
from 15 September 2002 to 30 June 2004, either in stool or in a
biological liquid that is normally sterile. When samples from ⬎1
household member yielded Campylobacter species, or when the
case was either part of a household in which there was a cluster of
instances of gastroenteritis or part of a recognized outbreak, only
the first identified case was enrolled.
The present study was a collaboration between the National
Reference Center (NRC) for Campylobacter and Helicobacter
(Centre National de Référence des Campylobacter and Helicobacter) and the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance
(Institut de Veille Sanitaire) in France, conducted as part of their
routine activity. Potential cases were recruited through the national Campylobacter surveillance network, which is based on a
voluntary network of private (n ⫽ 342) and public (n ⫽ 92)
laboratories that send their isolates to the NRC [24]. Laboratories notified the cases to the French Institute for Public Health
Surveillance by fax, to reduce the delay until an interview could
be conducted. Each working day, a maximum of 4 cases with the
shortest delay between the date of isolation and the date of notification were sampled. A letter was faxed to the case’s physician
to request from the case or the case’s parents informed consent
to participate in the study.
Each case was matched, by age, sex, and geographic area, with
one control selected from the patient registry of the case’s physician. The age groups of the matched pairs were defined as ⬍6
months, 6 months to 3 years, ⬎3 to ⬍15 years [⫾3 years], and
肁15 years [⫾10 years]. Cases and controls were not matched by
sex before 15 years of age, under the assumption that food habits
were similar by sex. Potential controls were excluded from the
study if they had experienced diarrhea within 1 month before or
1 week after the onset of infection in the matched case or if they
were identified ⬎15 days after the date that a Campylobacter
isolate was identified in the matched case. If a potential control
refused to participate or could not be reached after 5 attempts, a
search for another control was conducted.
The study received ethics approval from the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés.

Interviews and questionnaires. Cases and matched controls were contacted and interviewed by telephone by the same
interviewer, who was not blinded to the case/control status. For
children 聿12 years of age, a parent or a person who was familiar
with the usual environment and food habits of the children was
interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic characteristics; medical history, including use of any antibiotic within the month before onset of
infection in the matched case; clinical symptoms; occupational
activity; and specific exposures. Information on food consumption, the level of cooking of meat, food handling practices, travel
history, animal and water (i.e., drinking or swimming) exposures, and contact with a person with diarrhea was recorded for
cases and controls during the 8 days before onset in the matched
case.
Susceptibility testing of Campylobacter isolates. Campylobacter isolates were tested at the NRC for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, and tetracycline,
by use of the agar diffusion method, on Mueller-Hinton agar enriched with 5% sheep blood, with use of antibiotic disks according
to the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology [25].
Analysis. The level of cooking was classified as “undercooked” when the meat or poultry consumed was raw, rare, or
pink in color and as “cooked” when the meat or poultry consumed was well done or overcooked. Food handling hygiene
practices were classified as “poor utensils hygiene in the kitchen”
when hands or utensils used in the kitchen were not cleaned or
were dried only with a dish towel in between the handling of
meat or poultry and other foods and as “good utensils hygiene in
the kitchen” when hands or utensils were cleaned with water
only or a detergent or when utensils changed.
Variables that were associated with the outcome and for
which P ⬍ .2 in matched univariate analysis were considered for
multiple conditional logistic regression analysis. Matched odds
ratios (ORs) for which P ⭐ .05 were considered to be significant
in the multivariate analysis. We repeated the analysis after imputing for missing responses [26, 27]. All analyses were performed using Stata software (version 9; Stata Corporation).
The risk associated with the use of antibiotics within the
month before onset of illness was analyzed by comparing cases
with an antibiotic-resistant strain with (1) their matched controls and (2) cases with an antibiotic-susceptible strain.

reached after 5 attempts, 117 who refused to participate, 42 for
whom a matched control was not found, and 36 who were excluded for other reasons. The 285 enrolled cases were younger
(mean age, 19.5 years) than the cases who were excluded from
the study (mean age, 28.5 years) and were comparable with respect to sex (percentage of cases that were male, 60.1% vs. 56.3%,
respectively) and region of residence (data not shown). The
mean age of the cases and controls was 19.5 and 20.0 years, respectively. The median delay between the time of onset of disease
and the time when the interview was conducted was 15 days
(range, 5– 44 days), and the median delay between the time that
interviews were conducted for cases and controls was 4 days
(range, 0 – 64 days).
Clinical description. Of the 235 isolates in which the
Campylobacter species was fully identified, 192 (81.7%) were C.
jejuni, 36 (15.3%) were C. coli, 3 (1.3%) were C. fetus, and 4
(1.7%) were C. lari. The main symptoms were diarrhea (in 96.5% of
patients), abdominal pain (in 90.0%), and fever (in 71.6%). Bloody
diarrhea and vomiting were more common in children ⬍15 years
of age (table 1). Diarrhea lasted longer (1) in cases ⬎15 years of age
(median duration, 5 days) than in younger cases (median duration,
4 days) (P ⫽ .002) and (2) in cases with C. fetus infection (median duration, 13 days) than in cases with C. jejuni or C. coli
infection (median duration, 5 days) (P ⬍ .001). Forty-one
(14.4%) of the 285 cases were hospitalized (median duration, 2
days; range, 1–10 days).
Risk factors. Sixteen cases (5.6%) reported traveling abroad
in the 8 days before onset, compared with 7 controls (2.4%) (OR,
2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 – 6.4). Countries visited
included North Africa (n ⫽ 8), Europe (n ⫽ 8), Burkina Faso
and Ethiopia (n ⫽ 2), and Tahiti and Thailand (n ⫽ 5). Because
travelers were likely to have exposures that were remarkably different from those of nontravelers, and because exposures occurring during travels have not been investigated, travelers were

excluded from the univariate and multivariate matched analysis,
regardless of whether they were cases or controls.
In matched univariate analysis, consumption of undercooked
beef was associated with an increased risk of campylobacteriosis
(OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.4) (table 2). Cases were not more likely
than controls to report consumption of any poultry or other
meat, even that which was undercooked (data not shown). Eating in a restaurant increased the risk significantly (OR, 1.9; 95%
CI, 1.1–1.3). Cases were less likely than controls to have eaten
raw vegetables, fruits or berries, and fish or seafood.
Tasting or handling raw meat in the kitchen was not a risk
factor, whereas poor hygiene of hands and utensils in the kitchen
was; 30.0% and 37.4% of cases had poor hands hygiene or poor
utensils hygiene, respectively, between handling raw meat and
handling other food, compared with 21.0% and 26.1% of controls, respectively (table 2).
Contact with any pet or farm animals was not a significant risk
factor (table 2). Having contact with a person who had diarrhea
in the 8 days before onset increased the risk of Campylobacter
infection (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 – 4.4). Of the 51 cases (19.0%)
who reported contact with a person(s) with diarrhea, 28 reported contact with individuals in the same household, 12 reported contact with children outside the household who had
diarrhea, 7 reported contact with friends or colleagues at work,
and 4 reported contact with children, friends, or colleagues.
Multivariate analysis. Fourteen variables have been included in the multivariate model, both for the complete-case (CC)
and the multiple imputation (MI) analyses. No significant firstorder interaction was detected. In both models, having contact with
a person with diarrhea (ORCC, 3.32 [95% CI, 1.72– 6.4]; ORMI, 2.27
[95% CI, 1.24 – 4.14]), eating undercooked beef (ORCC, 2.26 [95%
CI, 1. 2– 4.24]; ORMI, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.65– 4.95]), and eating at restaurant (ORCC, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.26 – 4.74]; ORMI, 2.20 [95% CI,
1.23–3.93]) were independent risk factors for Campylobacter infection while eating beef bought from a butcher shop, farm, or market,
and eating raw vegetables was associated with a decreased risk of
infection (table 3). Poor utensils hygiene when preparing foods in
the kitchen (ORMI, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.33–3.37), which was found to be
a significant factor in univariate analysis, remained in multiple imputation analysis.
Antibiotic treatment and resistance. Of the 285 strains,
233 (81.8%) were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Results of
testing susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline, and gentamicin
were missing for 15 strains, and results of testing susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin were missing for 10 strains. Eighty-nine (48.0%) of
218 strains were resistant to ampicillin; 67 (30.7%) of 218, to
tetracycline; 60 (26.9%) of 223, to ciprofloxacin; 4 (1.7%) of 233,
to erythromycin; and 2 (0.9%) of 218 to gentamicin. The duration of illness was longer for cases infected with a strain resistant
to any antibiotic (median, 8.0 days; range, 1–38 days) than for
cases infected with a susceptible strain (median, 6.0 days; range,
2–30 days) (P ⫽ .02).

Nine (40.9%) of the 22 indigenous cases who reported receiving any antibiotic treatment in the month before onset were
infected with a ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni strain, compared
with 27 (17.9%) of the 151 indigenous cases who did not report

Fifteen (12.9%) of 116 cases 肁15 years of age, compared with
2 (1.7%) of 116 controls, reported receiving treatment with antibiotics during the month before the onset of illness (OR, 7.5;
95% CI, 1.7–32.8). No difference in the receipt of antibiotics was
noted between cases and controls ⬍15 years of age. Cases with
ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter infection (due to any
Campylobacter species or due to C. jejuni) were more likely to
have received any antibiotic before onset than were the controls
(21.4% for those with C. jejuni infection vs. 0% for controls;
OR, undefined), regardless of whether they had traveled abroad
(table 4). Antibiotic use was a risk factor for indigenous
ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni infection, compared with
ciprofloxacin-susceptible C. jejuni infection, and it was not a risk
factor for ciprofloxacin-susceptible infection when compared
with the matched control (table 4).

chicken as a risk factor for Campylobacter infection is often difficult. Furthermore, eating undercooked chicken may play a major role through cross-contamination from the juice of raw
chicken rather than through the direct risk associated with consumption of undercooked chicken. A social desirability bias
could have also hidden the association, with cases being less
likely than controls to report consumption of undercooked
poultry. However, this is unlikely, because cases were more likely
than controls to report poor hygiene in the kitchen, an exposure
for which social desirability bias may play a greater role.
Eating raw vegetables was associated with a decreased risk of
Campylobacter infection. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, including artifacts, bias, or
confounding associated with lifestyle and food habits not explored in the study, as well as a causal effect [12, 32, 38].
The use of poor utensils hygiene in the kitchen when handling
raw meat and other foods was an independent risk factor for
infection. Although previous studies explored hygiene practices
in the kitchen during food preparation, to our knowledge, no
study has been able to show an independent increased risk for
Campylobacter infection [5–7, 9, 11–13]. Hygiene practices perceived to be acceptable are not sufficient to prevent crosscontamination between a contaminated source (i.e., chicken)
and a vehicle (i.e., other food), which is the direct route of infection [12, 39]. Vehicles with low-level contamination are sufficient to cause Campylobacter infection [40]. Drying utensils or
hands with a dish towel in between handling meat or poultry and
other foods may be wrongly perceived as an acceptable measure,
although it does not prevent cross-contamination.
Person-to-person transmission of Campylobacter organisms
is thought to be rare. Other pathogens, like Salmonella organisms, that are mainly transmitted through food consumption
can be transmitted from person to person, particularly among
children [41]. For more susceptible hosts, this mode of transmission may occur more frequently in association with poor hygiene conditions, and for Campylobacter organisms, it may be
facilitated by its low infective dose. In the present study, contact
with a person who had diarrhea in the 8 days before onset was an
independent risk factor. Most contacts with a person with diarrhea occurred in the family household or with children who had
diarrhea outside the home. Our design did not allow differentiation of whether more frequent diarrhea among contacts before
the onset of infection was related to a common source of infection or truly revealed person-to-person transmission. However,
Campylobacter organisms may account for a large number of
household foodborne outbreaks that are unreported [42].
Like other studies, our study shows an association between
travel abroad and acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant
Campylobacter infection. Africa and Asia are the more common
destinations for French travelers, whereas, in northern European countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway), France and

lobacter infection. Receipt of antibiotic treatment within the
month before onset of illness increased the risk of developing a
ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni infection.
The most important food-specific risk factor was consumption of undercooked (raw, rare, or “pink”) beef. Few studies have
shown that beef was a food vehicle for Campylobacter infection.
In the United States, the fact that riding in a shopping cart next to
meat or poultry has been identified as risk factor in children
suggests that contamination may occur through direct contact.
Investigators discussed the risk of cross-contamination through
indirect exposure—that is, via the hands of caretakers as a result
of the external contamination of retail meat packages [28]. In
other studies, “ate red meat at barbecue/open fire,” “ate other
raw or undercooked meat or fish,” and “ate nonpoultry meat
prepared at restaurant” were identified as independent risk factors, without specification as to whether the meat could be pork,
veal, or beef [5, 7, 9]. Our finding may reflect a different food
habit in France or in southern European countries. Most casecontrol studies have been conducted in northern European
countries, and results may not reflect the food habits of individuals in southern Europe. The lack of association between consumption of beef and development of Campylobacter infection
in studies performed in the northern European countries could
be due to the less frequent consumption of undercooked beef in
those countries. Beef ranks third among the animal products
consumed in France, following pork and poultry in popularity
[29], and it is often eaten undercooked (rare or pink) or even
raw. In the present study, 59.3% of cases and 36.5% of controls
ate undercooked beef. Campylobacter organisms are known to
contaminate the gut and carcass of cattle [30, 31]. However, the
interpretation of this finding is complex, because Campylobacter
organisms are present only on the outside of beef. Eating undercooked beef may not reflect a direct mode of transmission but,
rather, may be a marker of cross-contamination when foods are
prepared in the kitchen. Eating at a restaurant, which has also
been identified as a risk factor in other studies, may be related to
consumption of undercooked, contaminated meat or to poor
hygiene practices used in the kitchen.
In this study, several food exposures identified as risk factors
in other studies were not found to increase the risk of Campylobacter infection. Although many studies identified consumption of chicken or poultry—and, more specifically, consumption
of undercooked chicken [3–10]—as a risk factor [5, 7, 9, 11, 32],
this was not the case in the present study. However, the lack of an
increased risk associated with poultry or chicken consumption
has been previously reported in several studies [13, 33–35], and
one study even found that eating chicken prepared at home was
protective [14]. Several reasons may explain these divergent results. In France, 80% of all broilers are colonized by Campylobacter species [36, 37]. Because chicken is widely consumed in
France, it is very likely that many people have immunity to
Campylobacter species, and those who are the most often ex-



results, because cases enrolled in the case group were not completely representative of those identified by the surveillance system (i.e., they were younger and represented a smaller proportion of cases that occur in summer). Cases were also recruited
from laboratories and could, therefore, differ from cases with
Campylobacter infection not diagnosed microbiologically.
Despite these limitations, the present study identifies important risk factors that are modifiable through changes in behavior,
particularly when they relates to cooking habits and hygiene
practices that favor cross-contamination during the preparation
of food in the kitchen. However, prevention of transmission of
Campylobacter organisms should be considered at each stage of
the food chain transformation, from animal feed to food that is
ready to eat. Efforts are needed to decrease contamination; in
particular, poultry and meat (including beef) have to be considered as a potential source of contamination. The present study
also strongly suggests that antibiotics used in humans have an
influence on the risk of Campylobacter infection and may contribute to select infection with antibiotic-resistant strains.

other European Mediterranean countries are at risk for foreign
travellers [43, 44]. However, traveling abroad accounted for a
low proportion of cases of Campylobacter infection.
An increased risk for acquiring ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni infection and Salmonella infection after receipt of any antibiotic treatment has been reported in few studies [45, 46]. This
increased risk was observed when cases infected with a resistant
strain were compared with healthy controls, as well when
they were compared with cases infected with a susceptible
strain, thereby suggesting that antibiotic use may facilitate
ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni infection. Such an effect is likely
related to disruption of the normal flora in a person taking antibiotics for another reason, and it may be also related to the
selection of a resistant strain related to the antibiotic used. If so,
in addition to their use in veterinary medicine, antibiotics used
in human medicine may contribute to the occurrence of
ciprofloxacin-resistant C. jejuni infections in humans. However,
we were not able to document precisely the antibiotics used, and
we cannot assess whether this increased risk is more related to
the use of a particular class of antibiotics [45]. Also, the limited
number of cases for which the analysis was done according to
Campylobacter species and antibiotic resistance profile reduced
our ability to explore this association in detail.
Our results need to be interpreted with caution, however. The
fact that this exploratory study assessed many exposures could
have led to several random findings. Two factors reduced the
statistical power of the study: (1) the planned sample size was not
attained, and (2) data on specific exposures were missing. However, in comparison with complete-case analysis, the multiple
imputation method increased the statistical power, allowing 2
additional risks factors to be identified and more-precise estimates of the odds ratios to be obtained.
Although we made important efforts to reduce the delay between the time of onset of the disease and the time when cases
and controls were interviewed, memory effects cannot be excluded, particularly when many factors, including food consumption and cooking behaviors, were explored retrospectively.
These memory effects could lead to recall bias. In the present
study, such bias may more likely be nondifferential than differential, which tends to bias toward the nil rather than create a
biased association. Missing data may be generated by the same
memory effects, and a nonresponse bias could occur when the
proportion of missing data differs between cases and controls for
each exposure variable [47, 48]. In the present study, the proportion of data that were missing was similar for cases and controls. Because the results obtained using CC and MI analyses
were similar, and because the assumptions made during the use
of the MI analysis were met, the nonresponse bias was probably
negligible. When many factors contribute to the disease, as for
Campylobacter infection, we may also miss interaction or confounding variables for which the analysis cannot account. We
also need to be cautious regarding the external validity of our
