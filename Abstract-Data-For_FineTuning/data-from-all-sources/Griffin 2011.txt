Saliva has an important advantage over serum as a medium for antibody detection due to noninvasive sampling, which is critical for community-based epidemiological surveys. The
development of a Luminex multiplex immunoassay for measurement of salivary IgG and IgA
responses to potentially waterborne pathogens, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii,
Cryptosporidium, and four noroviruses, involved selection of antigens and optimization of
antigen coupling to Luminex microspheres. Coupling conﬁrmation was conducted using
antigen speciﬁc antibody or control sera at serial dilutions. Dose–response curves
corresponding to different coupling conditions were compared using statistical tests. Control
proteins in the speciﬁc antibody assay and a separate duplex assay for total immunoglobulins G
and A were employed to assess antibody cross-reactivity and variability in saliva composition.
200 saliva samples prospectively collected from 20 adult volunteers and 10 paired sera from a
subset of these volunteers were used to test this method. For chronic infections, H. pylori and
T. gondii, individuals who tested IgG seropositive using commercial diagnostic ELISA also had
the strongest salivary antibody responses in salivary antibody tests. A steep increase in antinorovirus salivary antibody response (immunoconversion) was observed after an episode of
acute diarrhea and vomiting in a volunteer. The Luminex assay also detected seroconversions
to Cryptosporidium using control sera from infected children. Ongoing efforts involve further
veriﬁcation of salivary antibody tests and their application in larger pilot community studies.

1. Introduction
Waterborne infections can be caused by a number of
bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens (Reynolds et al.,
2008). Outbreaks of waterborne infections in the US are
typically associated with treatment failures, contamination of
untreated groundwater, or secondary contamination of

drinking water in the distribution system (Liang et al.,
2006; USEPA, 2007). Low levels of pathogens can also be
present in drinking water during normal operation of public
water systems. It has been estimated that millions of sporadic
waterborne infections occur annually in the US (Messner
et al., 2006; Colford et al., 2006). In order to reduce public
health burden of waterborne infections, USEPA promulgated
new regulations that imposed more stringent treatment and
monitoring requirements on public water systems (USEPA,
2006a,b).
Risk assessments provide theoretical estimates of public
health effects of drinking water pollution that are used in
support of USEPA's rulemaking. The Safe Drinking Water Act
also mandates USEPA to conduct epidemiological studies of

waterborne infections to verify these risk assessments (104th
Congress, 1996). However, a randomized prospective intervention study in a US community did not demonstrate an
association between tap water consumption and sporadic
self-reported gastroenteritis (Colford et al., 2005), while
earlier studies in other countries produced inconsistent
results (Payment et al., 1991, 1997; Hellard et al., 2001).
Using fecal sampling in such prospective studies proved to be
problematic due to low rates of compliance and pathogen
detection. The invasive nature of blood sampling also limited
the application of serology in prospective surveys, especially
in children.
Oral ﬂuid (hereafter referred to as “saliva”) is a promising
alternative to serum in evaluating immune responses to
common waterborne infections (Gammie et al., 2002; McKie
et al., 2002). Because it is easy and safe to collect, saliva has been
used in large-scale, inexpensive, cross-sectional population
surveys of several infections (Morris-Cunnington et al., 2004a,
b; Quoilin et al., 2007). These previous studies used monoplex
salivary immunoassays. A multiplex assay capable of simultaneous quantitation of salivary antibody responses to several
pathogens would be highly advantageous. In this project, a
multiplex immunoassay was developed using Luminex xMAP
microsphere-based technology (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX).
Several pathogens transmissible through drinking water were
chosen based on their importance for public health, prior
research on salivary antibody responses, and availability of
puriﬁed or recombinant immunogenic proteins. Selection
included causative agents of chronic or latent infection
(Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii), and transient
acute infection (noroviruses and Cryptosporidium).

Proteins were conjugated to unique sets of ﬂuorescent
Luminex microspheres according to manufacturer's recommendations. Brieﬂy, 5 × 106 carboxylated microspheres were
pelleted by centrifugation and washed in 100 μL of reagent
grade water. For surface activation, beads were resuspended
in 80 μL of 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4
with subsequent addition of 10 μL of 50 mg/mL N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)
and 10 μL of 50 mg/mL 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, Pierce), followed by
20 min incubation at room temperature.
Four buffers were tested for coupling proteins to microspheres: (i) 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid
(MES), pH 5.0; (ii) 100 mM MES, pH 6.1; (iii) phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4; and (iv) 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM
NaHCO3, pH 9.5. Activated beads were washed twice in 250 μL
of coupling buffer and resuspended in 100 μL of coupling
buffer. Varying amounts of each protein were added to
determine an optimal coupling concentration. Total volume
was brought to 500 μL with coupling buffer, followed by
rotational mixing for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were
then pelleted and resuspended in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1%
BSA, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.4), washed
twice and resuspended in 1 mL of the same buffer, and stored
at 4 °C.

2. Materials and methods

2.3. Luminex analysis

The multiplex assay to measure speciﬁc salivary antibody
responses employed a mixture of different sets of microbeads
with unique ﬂuorescent characteristics, each set coupled to a
speciﬁc antigen. Two versions of this assay using isotypespeciﬁc detection antibodies were developed for measuring
speciﬁc IgG and IgA responses. A supplemental duplex assay
with two sets of beads coupled to anti-human IgG and IgA
capture antibodies was also developed to measure total
salivary immunoglobulins and quantify speciﬁc antibody
responses in relation to the total isotype-speciﬁc immunoglobulin content of the sample.

MultiScreen BV 1.2 μm ﬁlter microplates (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) were washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-0.05%
Tween 20) and aspirated by vacuum manifold. Microspheres
were diluted to a concentration of 100 microspheres of
each type per μL in dilution buffer (PBS-1% BSA). Then, 50 μL
of bead mixture and 50 μL of sample (primary antibody,
diluted serum or saliva) were added to wells. Plates were
incubated on a shaker for 1 h at room temperature at 500 rpm,
washed 3 times, and beads resuspended in 50 μL of dilution
buffer. Next, 50 μL of biotinylated detection antibody in
dilution buffer was added to wells, followed by incubation
for 30 min at room temperature at 500 rpm and three washes.
Beads were resuspended in 50 μL of dilution buffer, then 50 μL
of dilution buffer with streptavidin R-phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to wells. After
incubation for 30 min at the previous conditions and three
washes, beads resuspended in 100 μL of dilution buffer were
analyzed using a Luminex-100 ﬂow cytometer at default
settings. Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of the reporter
signal estimated from at least 100 beads of each type was used
in data analysis.

2.1. Saliva and serum samples
Twenty USEPA scientists donated 200 saliva samples on
a weekly or monthly basis over two weeks to nine months.
Saliva was collected by rubbing the gums with an Oracol
sampler sponge (Malvern Medical Developments, Worcester,
UK) for 1 min, separated from sponges by centrifugation,
and stored at − 80 °C until use. Ten volunteers also donated
ﬁnger tip blood samples. Human study protocols were
approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, operating under an agreement
with USEPA. Written informed consent was acquired from all
volunteers.
This project also employed de-identiﬁed human sera from
individuals seropositive to H. pylori (gift of Dr. Harry Kleanthous,

2.2. Coupling proteins to microspheres

2.4. Data analysis
Luminex output data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Four-parameter S-shaped weighted
logistic dose–response curves (De Lean et al., 1978; Plikaytis



S.M. Grifﬁn et al. / Journal of Immunological Methods 364 (2011) 83–93

et al., 1991; Findlay and Dillard, 2007) were ﬁtted using PROC
NLIN. The basic four parameter logistic equation is as follows:
Y =a+

b−a
 d
X
1+
c

where Y is Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI), X is
concentration of primary antibody or sample dilution factor,
a and b are the lower and upper asymptotes respectively, c is
the location parameter (same units as X), and d is the
dimensionless shape parameter. The weighting function was
chosen based on variability in the response and set equal to 1/
(Y)1.8 (Marchese et al., 2009).
Dose–response curves for each protein were compared to
identify the coupling conditions producing the highest
reactivity of primary antibody at the lowest concentrations.
Regression models that allowed individual parameters a, b, c,
and d for each coupling condition were initially ﬁtted to the
data. These full models were compared with reduced
(constrained) models that forced one or more parameter(s)
to be shared by all curves using standard F tests as previously
described (De Lean et al., 1978).
Below is an example of a curve equation with common
parameters a, b, and d for all k coupling conditions, and
condition-speciﬁc parameter c:
b−a
d
X
c0 + m1 Z1 + … + mk−1 Zk−1



Y =a+
1+

where c0 is the location parameter for the reference category,
Z1 to Zk − 1 are binary indicators for k coupling condition
categories and m1 to mk − 1 are parameters reﬂecting the
effect of changing coupling conditions on the location
parameter c.
The reference category was always deﬁned as coupling
buffer pH 5.0 and the highest protein coupling concentration
tested. If a higher pH was not associated with a signiﬁcantly
(α b 0.05) better result, the default pH 5.0 was selected as
“optimal”. The highest concentration of protein tested was
assumed “optimal” if the second highest concentration
produced signiﬁcantly worse results. If the difference was
not signiﬁcant, the next highest concentration was selected
until the effect of reducing the protein concentration became
signiﬁcant.
Four-parameter logistic dose–response curves were also
ﬁtted to puriﬁed human antibody data obtained from the
total immunoglobulin assay. The resulting equations were
then rearranged and applied to the results of saliva analyses
to estimate concentrations of salivary immunoglobulins from
the MFI data.

Kleanthous, Acambis), recombinant ﬂagellin, Vac toxin, and
small subunit urease (HPA-5040-5, HPA-5010-5 and HPA5020-5 respectively, Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) were
coupled to different sets of microbeads. Coupling conﬁrmation
tests were conducted using de-identiﬁed positive control sera
(gift of H. Kleanthous), rabbit anti-H. pylori polyclonal antibody
(B92310R, Meridian Life Science), rabbit anti-Vac polyclonal
antibody, and mouse anti-small subunit urease monoclonal
antibody (HPP-5013-9 and HPM-5021-5 respectively, Austral
Biologicals).
2.5.1.2. Toxoplasma gondii. Protein coupling experiments
involved soluble protein extract of strain RH tachyzoites
(R9A350, Meridian Life Science) and three sources of
immunogenic p30 membrane protein (all from Meridian):
(i) recombinant from E. coli (R18426), (ii) puriﬁed from
infected HeLa cells (R9A300), and (iii) puriﬁed from infected
mice (R86300). Recombinant p30 and p30 from mice were
dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against PBS (1 change) using SlideA-Lyzer 10 K molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) dialysis
cassettes (Pierce) to remove storage buffers containing
primary amines, which can bind to carboxyl groups on the
microsphere surface. Mouse monoclonal antibody to T. gondii
p30 protein (C86319M, Meridian Life Science) and goat
polyclonal antibody raised against tachyzoites of T. gondii
strain RH (OBT0969, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) were used for
coupling conﬁrmation.
2.5.1.3. Noroviruses. Puriﬁed recombinant P domains of major
capsid proteins from three noroviruses, Norwalk (genogroup
I, subgroup 1, GI.1), VA387 (GII.4), and VA207 (GII.9), and a
polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pigs against noroviruses
were gifts of Dr. Xi Jiang of Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH). Puriﬁcation of these GSTtagged proteins from E. coli and removal of GST tags were
performed as previously described; puriﬁed proteins formed
5 nm P-particles comprised of 12 P dimers (Tan and Jiang,
2005; Tan et al., 2008). Norovirus GII.4 Minerva virus-like
particles (VLPs) and two different polyclonal sera raised
against Minerva VLPs, one from guinea pig and another from
rabbit, were gifts of Dr. Alec Sutherland (Arizona State
University). These VLPs were prepared using a baculovirus
expression system as previously described (Jiang et al., 1992;
Jiang et al., 1995).
2.5.1.4. Cryptosporidium. Puriﬁed recombinant gp15 (15 kDa)
protein of C. hominis TU502 isolate and mouse anti-C. hominis
gp15 monoclonal antibody were gifts of Dr. Honorine Ward
(Tufts Medical Center). The protein containing thioredoxin,
His, and S tags, was cloned and puriﬁed as described
previously (Cevallos et al., 2000; Preidis et al., 2007).
Transformed E. coli strain BL21 culture expressing the
recombinant C. parvum 27 kDa protein with N-terminal
glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag and ascites ﬂuid containing mouse monoclonal antibody to this protein were gifts of
Dr. Jeffrey Priest (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA). The protein was expressed and puriﬁed as
described previously (Priest et al., 1999; Moss et al., 2004).
Goat anti-C. parvum polyclonal IgG antibody (ab20787,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was also used for coupling
conﬁrmation.

2.5.1.5. Internal controls. A set of beads coupled to GST (20237,
Pierce) was included in the multiplex assays to control for
non-speciﬁc reactivity, particularly with GST tags of certain
recombinant proteins. Rabbit anti-GST antibody (A-5800,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used in coupling conﬁrmation
experiments. Beads coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA,
A7030, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were also included in
multiplex assays to assess potential non-speciﬁc reactivity of
salivary antibodies with BSA-blocked microbeads.

2.6. Serological ELISA assays

2.5.2. Secondary antibodies and reporter
The following biotinylated secondary antibodies were
used in coupling conﬁrmation tests: donkey anti-goat IgG
(ab6884) from Abcam; goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-speciﬁc (115065-071), donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (706-065-148), donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (711-065-152), and donkey antihuman IgG Fc-speciﬁc (709-065-098), all from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA. Concentrations were prepared at 8 μg/mL for all secondary detection
antibodies and 10 μg/mL for SAPE.
Secondary detection antibodies for analysis of human saliva
were selected from among ﬁve biotinylated anti-human IgG
and three biotinylated anti-human IgA antibodies: donkey antihuman IgG Fc-speciﬁc (709-065-098), donkey anti-human IgG
H + L (709-065-149), goat anti-human IgG H + L (109-065003), all from Jackson ImmunoResearch, goat anti-human IgG
H + L (81-7140, Invitrogen), goat anti-human IgGγ (16-10-02,
KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), goat anti-human IgAα (109-065-011,
Jackson ImmunoResearch), goat anti-human IgA F(ab)′2
(AHI1109, Invitrogen), and goat anti-human IgA (16-10-01,
KPL). To determine an optimal antibody concentration, selected
detection antibodies were assayed at 7.5 to 37.5 μg/mL with
several serially diluted saliva samples. Next, a concentration of
SAPE was selected from a 2.5 to 17.5 μg/mL range at a constant
concentration of detection antibody.

2.7. Development of a duplex assay for total immunoglobulins
G and A

IgG responses to H. pylori and T. gondii in serum samples
collected from EPA volunteers were measured using commercial diagnostic ELISA kits (IB79236, IBL-America, Minneapolis,
MN and EG 127, Viro-Immun Labor-Diagnostika GmbH,
Oberursel, Germany, respectively) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Plates were read at 450 nm on a BioTek
Synergy HT (Winooski, VT) microplate reader.

2.7.1. Anti-human capture antibodies
Afﬁnity puriﬁed goat anti-human antibodies (capture
antibodies), speciﬁc to human IgGγ and IgAα (01-10-02
and 01-10-01, KPL) were used in this assay. Coupling
conﬁrmation tests were conducted using puriﬁed human
IgG and IgA (009-000-001, 009-000-012, Jackson ImmunoResearch) assayed at serial concentrations.

2.7.2. Secondary antibodies and reporter
Anti-human IgG and IgA detection antibodies had to be
from the same species (goat) as both capture antibodies in
order to avoid cross-reactivity. Biotinylated goat anti-human
IgG and IgA detection antibodies (16-10-02 and 16-10-01,
KPL) were used in this assay. To determine optimal secondary
antibody concentrations, saliva samples were tested with a
range of concentrations of each detection antibody, while
SAPE concentration was held constant at 8 μg/mL. At the next
step, saliva samples were analyzed with a constant concentration of detection antibodies and a range of SAPE concentrations from 1 to 10 μg/mL in order to select the optimal
SAPE concentration.

four-parameter logistic dose–response curves. These curves shared lower asymptote a and upper asymptote b. Values of the location parameters c are curvespeciﬁc. Two values of the shape parameter d were used: one for pH 5.0 to 7.4 and another for pH 9.5.

3. Results
3.1. Multiplex assay for IgG and IgA responses to microbial
antigens
The ﬁnal assay composition and coupling conditions for
each protein are described below and presented in Table 1.
Results pertaining to H. pylori sonicate are presented in greater
detail to demonstrate the methodology, while results for other
proteins are described more succinctly with additional
information available in on-line Supplementary materials.
3.1.1. H. pylori
For whole cell sonicate, coupling experiments were conducted at 25 and 100 μg/500 μL, and pH values 5.0, 6.1, 7.4, and
9.5. Coupling conﬁrmation tests using rabbit anti-H. pylori
polyclonal antibody demonstrated that optimal coupling
conditions were pH 5.0 and 100 μg/500 μL (Fig. 1, Table 2). A
reduced model with a common upper asymptote parameter b

did not differ signiﬁcantly from a full model. The 31,519 MFI
upper asymptote value approximates the maximum ﬂuorescence intensity for Luminex assays using biotinylated detection
antibodies and SAPE (manufacturer's data). Two dose–
response curves for experiments conducted at pH 9.5 were
signiﬁcantly less steep (smaller absolute value of d) than the
other six curves. A common value of d for these two curves was
justiﬁable (p N 0.05 for the difference). The smallest estimated
value of the location parameter c, suggesting the most efﬁcient
protein coupling, corresponded to pH 5.0 and 100 μg/500 μL
(reference category). Since values of c for higher pH buffers
were greater indicating less efﬁcient coupling, the default pH
5.0 was selected as “optimal”. The effect of using 25 μg/500 μL
of protein at pH 5.0 on c was short of being signiﬁcant,
suggesting that this lower concentration can be used to reduce
the expenditure of proteins (Table 1). However, since H. pylori
detergent extract is inexpensive and readily available from a
commercial source, using a higher protein concentration may
also be justiﬁable.

unique location parameter c. P values are provided for contrasts with the reference category (coupling buffer pH 5.0, concentration of protein 100 μg/500 μL).

coupling conditions for small subunit urease, Vac, and
ﬂagellin were pH 5.0 and 25 μg/500 μL of protein (not

Serial dilutions of saliva from seropositive individuals
were analyzed using a multiplex assay that included all of
the above antigens (Fig. 4). Salivary antibody responses to
H. pylori whole cell sonicate and recombinant urease were
strongest; therefore, these two were included in the ﬁnal

Serum ELISA, OD at 450 nm
Fig. 2. Veriﬁcation of Luminex test for salivary IgG responses to H. pylori
whole cell sonicate using diagnostic IgG ELISA of paired serum samples.
Saliva was analyzed at 1:4 dilution in the Luminex assay; serum was
analyzed at 1:100 dilution in ELISA.

Two EPA volunteers who tested seropositive using
diagnostic ELISA likewise had the strongest salivary IgG
responses to H. pylori sonicate (Fig. 2). Analysis of serially
diluted saliva samples from both seropositive (“infected”)
and selected seronegative (“not infected”) individuals using
the multiplex assay which included antigens of other
pathogens and internal controls demonstrated that salivary
IgG responses remained much stronger in seropositive
individuals, even at a 1:1024 dilution of saliva (Fig. 3).
For H. pylori urease, nine coupling experiments were
conducted at concentrations of 1, 5, and 25 μg/500 μL and pH
values of 5.0, 6.1, and 7.4. Coupling conﬁrmation tests
conducted using positive control sera demonstrated that the
best results were produced using pH 5.0 and 25 μg/500 μL
(reference category). However, results of coupling at pH 5.0
and 5 μg/500 μL were not signiﬁcantly different from the
reference category (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, use of pH 5.0 and 5 μg/500 μL of urease
at coupling can minimize use of this protein without

3.1.2. T. gondii
For soluble protein extract of tachyzoites, optimal coupling conditions occurred at a protein concentration of
100 μg/500 μL and pH 5.0 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Coupling
conﬁrmation tests indicated that only p30 protein from HeLa
cells produced satisfactory results compared to other sources
of this protein. Optimal coupling conditions for the p30
protein were 5 μg/500 μL at pH 5.0 (Table 1); increasing
protein concentration did not improve coupling efﬁciency
(not shown).
Two of 10 EPA volunteers who tested seropositive to
T. gondii using diagnostic serological ELISA, likewise had the
strongest salivary IgG responses to this parasite (Supplementary Fig. 3). Using the multiplex assay, salivary IgG responses
to soluble T. gondii proteins remained markedly higher in
both seropositive individuals compared to seronegative
controls at 1:64 dilution; in one seropositive individual, IgG
response remained elevated at 1:1,024 dilution of saliva
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
3.1.3. Noroviruses
Recombinant P-particles of Norwalk, VA387, and VA207
viruses, and VLPs of Minerva virus were coupled to microbeads
at pH 5.0 only. Concentrations at coupling varied from 1 to
10 μg/500 μL for P-particles and from 5 to 90 μg/500 μL for
Minerva VLPs. Analysis of dose–response curves (results for
VA207 are shown on Supplementary Fig. 5) indicated that

coupling at 10 μg/500 μL produced signiﬁcantly (p b 0.05) better
results than at 5 μg/500 μL, although these improvements
were not substantial. While 10 μg/500 μL, is optimal, coupling
at 5 μg/500 μL can minimize the use of valuable P-particles.
Anti-GST antibodies reacted strongly with beads coupled to
these norovirus proteins suggesting incomplete removal of
the GST tag during puriﬁcation. In further tests, salivary
antibody reactivity with GST-coupled beads was used as assay
background.
For Minerva VLPs, results of coupling at 5 μg/500 μL were
unsatisfactory, probably due to the much larger size of VLPs
compared to P-particles (30 nm vs. 5 nm). A substantially
higher concentration of VLPs at coupling, 90 μg/500 μL, was
selected for the ﬁnal assay (Table 1). Tests using the multiplex
assay showed that anti-Minerva antibodies cross-reacted
strongly with VA387 (both GII.4 noroviruses), but not with
Norwalk and VA207 antigens (Supplementary Fig. 6).

For analysis of immunoconversions, all saliva samples
from each EPA volunteer were assayed on one plate after the
end of follow-up. Two of 20 volunteers reported episodes of
acute diarrhea and vomiting, typical symptoms of norovirus
infection. One individual exhibited a characteristic steep
increase and subsequent gradual decline in salivary IgG and
IgA responses to VA387 norovirus after an episode of
symptoms (Fig. 5). Antibody responses to all other pathogens
in the assay, including Norwalk virus, remained practically
unchanged or slightly declined.
Convalescent phase paired serum and saliva samples from
this individual were analyzed for IgG and IgA responses at serial
dilutions using the multiplex assay. Ratios of antibody responses
to VA387 P-particles and GST were the greatest at 1:4 dilution of
saliva suggesting that this dilution was optimal in this case.
Salivary IgA exhibited a stronger non-speciﬁc reactivity than
IgG. For serum, optimal sample dilution was approximately

1:30,000 for IgA tests and N60,000 for IgG, demonstrating a high
intensity antibody response (Supplementary Fig. 7).
3.1.4. Cryptosporidium
Two recombinant proteins of Cryptosporidium spp.,
C. parvum 27 kDa protein and C. hominis gp15 (15 kDa),
were each coupled at pH 5.0, 6.1, and 7.4 and protein
concentrations 1, 5, and 25 μg/500 μL. For gp15 protein, best
coupling results were produced at pH 5.0 and 25 μg/500 μL.
However, results at pH 5.0 and 5 μg/500 μL were not
signiﬁcantly worse (Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, these
conditions are recommended when protein availability is
limited (Table 1). For the 27 kDa protein, optimal coupling
conditions were pH 5.0 and 25 μg/500 μL (not shown).
Control pre-infection and post-infection serum samples
from two Cryptosporidium-diagnosed children were analyzed
at serial dilutions from 1:100 to 1:409,600 using the
multiplex assay. Since the recombinant protein of C. parvum
contained a GST tag, the results for this protein and, for
consistency, the C. hominis gp15 protein, were expressed as
ratios of anti-Cryptosporidium and anti-GST antibody reactions. Both children seroconverted to both proteins following
infection (Fig. 6), but did not experience increases in antibody
reactivity with other antigens in the multiplex assay (not
shown). Pearson correlation between log-transformed speciﬁc antibody responses to Cryptosporidium in paired sera and
saliva from EPA volunteers was approximately 0.9 for IgA and
IgG antibodies.

antigen and GST

3.1.5. Selection and optimization of secondary antibodies
To select best performing anti-human IgG and IgA
detection antibodies for the multiplex assay, saliva samples
from volunteers with strong salivary anti-H. pylori, antiT. gondii, and anti-norovirus VA387 responses were assayed
at 1:4 to 1:1,024 dilutions and analyzed using ﬁve different
anti-human IgG antibodies and three anti-human IgA antibodies (see Section 2.5.2). All ﬁve anti-human IgG antibodies
produced similar MFI for antibody responses to the target
antigens in all positive individuals. However, biotinylated
donkey anti-human IgG Fc-speciﬁc antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) consistently produced two to three times

lower reactivity with GST and BSA, as well as Cryptosporidium
27 kDa protein compared with other four anti-human IgG
antibodies. All three anti-human IgA antibodies produced
similar results; goat anti-IgAα (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
was selected due to its slightly lower cross-reactivity and
lower cost. Optimal results were produced using 30 μg/mL of
these anti-IgG and anti-IgA antibodies; improvement due to
higher antibody concentrations was not signiﬁcant. The effect
of increasing SAPE concentration leveled off at 10 μg/mL (not
shown). All tests of saliva and serum samples described above
were conducted using the optimized multiplex assay.
3.1.6. Effects of multiplexing
Aliquots of saliva samples from individuals with strong
antibody responses to H. pylori, T. gondii, and VA387 norovirus
were analyzed using monoplex assays for these pathogens
and the full optimized multiplex assay. The effects of
multiplexing on antibody responses to H. pylori and T. gondii
were not detectable; however, there was approximately 15%
reduction in measured anti-VA387 antibody responses.
3.2. Supplementary duplex assay for total immunoglobulins
G and A
Goat anti-human capture antibodies were coupled to
microbeads at pH 5.0 (Luminex-recommended pH for
immunoglobulins) and concentrations from 5 to 125 μg/
500 μL. Coupling conﬁrmation tests using puriﬁed human
immunoglobulins indicated that optimal concentration of
both antibodies at coupling was 25 μg/500 μL (Table 1).
Higher concentrations did not result in signiﬁcant improvement (p N 0.05). The optimal concentration for each antihuman IgG and anti-human IgA secondary detection antibody
was 4 μg/mL, while optimal SAPE concentration was 8 μg/mL.
Cross-reactivity tests using serial dilutions of puriﬁed
human IgG or IgA demonstrated that, for each antibody
isotype, cross-reactivity with another isotype accounted for
less than 0.1% of the estimated antibody concentration.
Average intra-plate and inter-plate coefﬁcients of variation
(CoV) were 5.4% and 11.4%, respectively, for IgG, and 4.5% and
11.7% for IgA. The quantitation ranges for puriﬁed human IgG
were from 0.2 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and from 0.2 ng/mL to
80 ng/mL for IgA (Fig. 7). Total salivary IgG and IgA
concentrations were quantiﬁable in the dilution range from
1:5,000 to 1:200,000 (Supplementary Fig. 9). An optimal
dilution of saliva for the duplex total IgG and IgA assay was
between 1:20,000 and 1:60,000.
Volumes of saliva samples collected from EPA volunteers
using Oracol samplers were approximately normally distributed with mean 0.71 mL, standard deviation 0.33 mL, and
range 0.01–1.50 ml. Considering losses during sample preparation, a minimum initial saliva volume of 0.2 mL was
necessary to conduct all three tests (speciﬁc IgG and IgA, and
total immunoglobulins). Five percent of samples had volumes
less than 0.2 mL.
Concentrations of total IgG and IgA in saliva samples
approximated a log-normal distribution with geometric
mean (geometric standard deviation) 21 (2.6) and 50 (2.2)
μg/mL, respectively. Random intercept regression analysis
demonstrated that larger sample volumes were associated
with lower antibody concentrations: IgG and IgA were 43%

percentile of sample volume distribution compared to the

4. Discussion
This manuscript presents the ﬁrst stage of a pilot, proofof-concept project to develop a non-invasive salivary antibody technique for surveillance of waterborne infections. The
Luminex ﬂuorescent microsphere suspension method was
selected due to its multiplexing capabilities, which can
greatly reduce analysis costs and the necessary volume of
saliva.
Previous research demonstrated that pH 5.0 is optimal for
binding immunoglobulins to Luminex beads because it allows
for lysine residues in the antibody's constant region to bind
carboxyl groups on the bead surface. This orientates the
antibody binding region away from the surface (Martins et al.,
2006). Different pH values may be optimal for coupling other
proteins to beads (Martins et al., 2006). In this study, several
unrelated puriﬁed proteins were coupled to beads at pH
values from 5.0 to 9.5; pH 5.0 was selected as an optimal
condition for all proteins.
Salivary and serological IgG tests for H. pylori tend to have
similarly high sensitivity and speciﬁcity values (Luzza et al.,
1997; Reilly et al., 1997; Bode et al., 2002). Limited existing
data suggest that salivary IgG responses to several antigens of
T. gondii strongly correlate with systemic antibody responses
(Stroehle et al., 2005). In this study, results of Luminex tests
for salivary IgG antibodies to H. pylori and T. gondii matched
those of diagnostic serological ELISA tests. However, further
validation using a larger set of samples is necessary to
evaluate sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the Luminex assay.
Diagnostic serological tests for acute short-term infections, norovirus and Cryptosporidium, are not available.
Incidence of these infections cannot be reliably elucidated
from cross-sectional antibody data. While seroconversion can
serve as an indicator of incident infections, prospective
serological studies are few due to the invasive nature of

blood sampling. The non-invasive salivary antibody method
lends itself to prospective studies.
Serum and salivary anti-norovirus IgA antibodies increase
steeply within several days after infection and start to decline
within two weeks, while IgG antibodies typically peak
between two and three weeks post-infection, and then
gradually decline (Erdman et al., 1989; Lindesmith et al.,
2003, 2005). Previous studies deﬁned immunoconversion as
at least a fourfold increase in serum or salivary anti-norovirus
antibody responses (Monroe et al., 1993; Moe et al., 2004). In
this project, one volunteer experienced an immunoconversion to norovirus VA387 after an episode of symptoms typical
of norovirus infection. The large magnitude of an increase in
anti-VA387 antibody with no concurrent increases in
responses to Norwalk virus or other pathogens in the assay
provides strong evidence of infection with a genogroup II
norovirus (these samples were not tested for responses to
VA207 and Minerva noroviruses, which were added to the
multiplex assay at a later stage).
Two Cryptosporidium proteins that were included in this
assay have been shown to induce strong antibody responses
in humans (Moss et al., 1994, 1998a). The median half-life of
serum IgG to these proteins can vary from 12 weeks (Priest
et al., 2001) to almost 15 months (Sandhu et al., 2006), while
serum IgA response can decay to a non-detectable level
within 10 weeks post-infection (Moss et al., 1998a,b). In this
study, the multiplex immunoassay detected concurrent seroconversions to both C. parvum 27 kDa and C. hominis 15 kDa
proteins in two children with conﬁrmed Cryptosporidium
infections (species not determined). These results are consistent with previous research indicating the lack of species
speciﬁcity of antibody responses to these proteins (Sandhu
et al., 2006; Priest et al., 2006).
This salivary antibody assay remains to be validated using
saliva from individuals with diagnosed Cryptosporidium
infections. Previous research demonstrated elevated antiCryptosporidium salivary IgG and IgA responses in recently
infected individuals (Cozon et al., 1994; Moss et al., 2004).
Elevated salivary IgG responses to the gp15 protein have also

been statistically associated with recent episodes of diarrhea
(Egorov et al., 2010).
The Oracol samplers, designed to collect crevicular ﬂuid
enriched with serum antibodies (Nishanian et al., 1998; McKie
et al., 2002), are well accepted across age groups (Nokes et al.,
1998). This method produces higher titers of total IgG
compared with other saliva/oral ﬂuid sampling methods
(Vyse et al., 2001). The present study using Oracol samplers
demonstrated an inverse association between sample volume
(a function of sampling technique and individual saliva
output) and concentration of total salivary immunoglobulins.
Quantifying speciﬁc antibody responses in relation to the total
immunoglobulin content helped to account for sample-tosample variability in saliva composition and demonstrate a
strong association between episodes of diagnosed infections
or acute gastrointestinal symptoms and salivary antibody
immunoconversions to speciﬁc pathogens in subsequent pilot
surveys (manuscripts in preparation).
In summary, this project demonstrates that salivary
antibody has the potential to serve as a useful bioindicator
of selected infections. After further validation, this noninvasive method may facilitate relatively low cost epidemiological studies involving adults and children.
