E. coli and enterococci in recreational waters are monitored as indicators of fecal contamination,
pathogen presence, and health risk. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests for fecal
indicator bacteria can provide beach managers with same-day information about water quality, unlike
culture methods which provide that information the following day. The abilities of qPCR
measurements of indicator bacteria, as compared to culture measurements of indicator bacteria, as
predictors of pathogen presence or density in surface waters are not well understood. The purpose of
this study was to make such comparisons between water samples collected from Chicago area surface
waters, including rivers, inland lakes, Lake Michigan, and the Chicago Area Waterways System, which
is dominated by wastewater effluent. A total of 294 twenty-litre samples were collected and analyzed for
Giardia and Cryptosporidium. qPCR and membrane filtration methods were used to quantify E. coli
and enterococci. Correlation, logistic regression, and zero-inflated Poisson modeling were utilized to
evaluate associations between indicators and parasites. qPCR and culture measures of the indicator
bacteria were similar in their ability to predict parasite presence and density. Correlations between
parasites and indicators were generally stronger at waters not dominated by effluent. Associations
between indicator density and Giarida presence were observed more consistently than between
indicator density and Cryptosporidium presence. Associations between enterococci and parasites were
generally stronger than associations between E. coli and parasites. The use of qPCR monitoring in our
setting would generate more timely results without compromising the ability to predict parasite
presence or density.

Introduction
A variety of bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens have been
identified as causes of recreational waterborne illness outbreaks
in the US.1,2 Outside of the context of recognized outbreaks
approximately 2–4 percent of beachgoers develop sporadic cases
of acute gastrointestinal illness attributable to swimming at
freshwater and marine beaches.3,4 Rather than performing the
costly, time-consuming, and technically challenging tests for
a myriad of pathogens, easily measured bacteria that are associated with health risk have been monitored instead. At US
recreational waters, the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measured

Environmental impact
The quantitative polymerase chain reaction, because it is more rapid that culture measures of indicator bacteria, may become
a requirement of monitoring programs at US beaches. However, it is not know whether the new method of measuring indicators
actually ‘‘indicates’’ the presence of waterborne pathogens better than culture methods of measuring indicator bacteria. This
manuscript is the first to ask, and answer that question. These findings should help regulators and the scientific community select
measurement targets and methods for monitoring surface waters.

are Escherichia coli (for freshwater) and Enterococcus spp. (for
fresh or marine water). FIB densities are determined by counting
the colony-forming units after overnight incubation in culture
media. This method takes at least 18 to 24 h to complete, during
which time swimmers can be exposed to poor-quality water.5–7
The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been
used to detect and quantify the genetic material of indicator
bacteria within 4 h of arrival at the laboratory.8 Because qPCR
provides a faster method for assessing water quality, it has the
potential to reduce illnesses resulting from exposure to contaminated waters. In 2004, the National Research Council of the
National Academy of Sciences released the findings9 of
a committee that, among other tasks, sought to ‘‘evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of [candidate indicators] for reflecting
the presence, quantity, and viability of.important pathogens.’’
Little is known about how qPCR measures of FIB compare to
culture measures of FIB as predictors of pathogen presence and
density. Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum are
protozoan pathogens that have caused outbreaks of recreational
waterborne gastrointestinal illness.1,2 The present study
compares two methods (qPCR and culture) for quantifying fecal
indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) as predictors of
Giardia and Cryptosporidium presence and density.

sampling. Grab sampling was used to collect water for both
the culture and qPCR analyses of the indicator microbes. The
surface of the water (up to 10 cm of depth) was sampled with the
bottle’s opening facing against the current at an angle of
45 degrees. Samples were collected in sterile containers at 2 h
intervals at recreational access points. One to four rounds of
sampling took place per day, depending on the duration of
recreational activities of study participants. On days of sampling
CAWS recreation areas, samples were also collected at 6 h
intervals at locations approximately 3km above and 3km below
the WWTPs. Large-volume sampling methods were used to
collect samples for analysis of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium
spp. with the use of continuous flow centrifugation (CFC),
a method that concentrate protozoan parasite (oo)cysts.11 These
samples were collected 1–2 times per day at 6 h intervals. Grab
samples for analysis of indicator bacteria were generally collected
within one hour of large-volume sampling the parasites.
Precipitation data was obtained from the Illinois State Water
Survey (http://www.isws.illinois.edu/data.asp) and variables
were created to summarize the amount of rain in the 24, 48, 72,
and 96 h prior to each round of sampling.

Materials and methods

Culture methods. After transportation of samples on ice to
a commercial laboratory (Microbac, Inc., Merrilville, IN), E. coli
was analyzed according to U.S. EPA Method 160312 with
modified membrane-Thermotolerant E. coli (mTEC) agar (BD,
product # 214880). Enterococci was analyzed using U.S. EPA
method 160013 with modified membrane-Enteroccocus Indoxylb-D-Glucoside (mEI) agar (BD, product # 214881). For both
indicator bacteria, a minimum of five dilutions were performed
per sample in order to generate at least one plate per sample in
the optimal range of colonies for enumeration.

Setting
The Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and Recreation
Study (CHEERS) was a prospective cohort study performed by
researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of
Public Health (UIC) with the objective of investigating the health
risks of limited contact recreation on the effluent-dominated
Chicago Area Waterways System (CAWS) (Fig. 1). The CAWS
is a 126 km system of rivers and channels that diverts wastewater
and urban drainage away from Lake Michigan, the source of
drinking water for the Chicago area. Overall, about 75% of the
flow in the CAWS is secondary-treated (aerobic digestion)
effluent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.10
The effluent is not disinfected. During dry weather, effluent from
the WWTPs accounts for nearly all flow in the system. During
wet weather, storm runoff and combined sewer overflows
contribute to flow on the CAWS. In addition to the CAWS,
water was also sampled at locations not dominated by effluent,
such as Lake Michigan harbors and beaches, local rivers (Fox,
DuPage, Des Plaines) and inland lakes (Crystal, Maple, Busse,
Tampier, Skokie Lagoons, others). We refer to these other
waters, which are not dominated by effluent, as general use
waters (GUW). At Lake Michigan beaches, full-contact recreation takes place; at the other GUW sites, limited contact recreation predominates.
Sample collection
Water samples were collected between April and July 2009 at 17
CAWS sites and 28 GUW sites. Water was sampled at boat
launches, piers and other access points. Surface water sample
collection was performed according to U.S. EPA methods by two
main procedures, direct (‘‘grab’’) sampling and large-volume

Microbiological methods

qPCR methods. At UIC, under a laminar flow hood, 100 mL
aliquots of grab samples were poured into disposable filter funnels and vacuum filtered through 47-mm, 0.4 micrometre poresized Millipore Isopore polycarbonate membrane filters.
These membrane filters were then folded and placed into 2 mL
extraction tubes pre-loaded with 212–300 mm Sigma acid-washed
glass beads (Cat# S0205-50, GeneRite). These were stored at
80  C until transport to Mycometrics, Inc (Monmouth Junction, NJ) laboratory for real time PCR quantification.
Enterococci were analyzed by qPCR consistent with Method
A.14 E. coli were analyzed by qPCR using the EC23S857 target
recently described by Chern and colleagues.15 The primers and
probes used are listed in Table 1. Reactions were performed in
96-wells optical grade reaction plates (Cat# N801-0560, Applied
Biosystems) by addition of the following components: 12.5 mL of
TaqMan Universal Master Mix with AmpliTaq Gold  DNA
polymerase (Cat# 4318157, Applied Biosystems), 3.5 mL of
mixture of forward and reverse primers (5 mM each) and 400 nM
TaqMan probe, 2.5 mL of BSA 2 mg ml1 BSA (fraction V,
sigma), 1.5 mL of sterile H2O and 5 mL of DNA template. The
reactions were monitored in a 7300 Real Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were: 2
min at 50  C, 10 min at 95  C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95  C, and 1 min
at 60  C. Fluorescence values for determinations of cycle

threshold (Ct) were manually set at 0.03. Cycler settings were the
same for E. coli and enterococci analyses.
Three calibration standards were prepared for each sample
process as described in EPA Method A.14 Calibrator cells (Ent.
faecalis, ATCC 29212 and E. coli, ATCC 25922) were purchased
from ATCC and cultured in house at Mycometrics. A known
amount of 10 mL calibrator cell suspension (1  105 cells for
Enterococci and 5  105 cells for E. coli) was spotted onto the
clean polycarbonate filter in preloaded bead tubes (Cat# 0205-

50, GeneRite, NJ) of the three calibrator standards, each run in
duplicate for a total of six reactions. A preloaded bead tube
containing a clean polycarbonate filter served as the method
blank for each sample process.
All the sample filters, calibrator samples, and blanks (negative
controls) were placed in 600 mL of extraction buffer for a final
concentration of 0.2 mg mL1 salmon testes DNA (SigmaAldrich #D1626) and were processed by glass milling to release
total DNA. The concentration of salmon testes DNA stock was

determined by OD260 reading in a spectrophotometer. An OD260
of 1 is approximately equal to 50 mg/mL. After milling, the
extraction tubes were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 1 min and
400 mL of crude extract was transferred to clean, low-DNAbinding, 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Cat# S1203-17-PK,
GeneRite, NJ). 400 mL crude extract was centrifuged for 5 min at
12,000  g. 350 mL of clarified supernatant was transferred to
another 1.7 mL tube as undiluted clarified crude extract. A 50 mL
of aliquot of each sample was diluted with 200 mL of elution
buffer (Cat# S2401-50, GeneRite, NJ) to make 5-fold dilutions
for qPCR analyses.
The comparative cycle threshold (CT) method (also called
the DDCT method) was used to quantify the relative quantity
of target DNA. This method determines the calibrator cell
equivalents (CCE) of target DNA sequences extracted from an
unknown test sample compared to the quantity of target
sequences extracted from a known quantity (calibrator cell
standard) of target organism in a calibrator sample. This is
done after normalizing for the relative recoveries of total DNA
in the extraction process from the two samples by comparing
the recovered quantities of an external reference organism
added to both calibrator and test (water) samples. For each test
sample and corresponding calibrator sample reaction, a DCT
value is obtained by subtracting the CT value of the reference
assay (CTref) from the Ct value of the target sequence assay
(CTtarget). A DDCT value is obtained by subtracting the DCT
value of the calibrator sample from the DCT value of the test
sample. The ratio of the target sequences in the test and calibrator samples is described by AE DDCT, where AE is the
amplification efficiency of the target assay. The ratios are
multiplied by the known number of the target organism cell in
the calibrator samples to obtain estimates of the number of
target cells (also called calibrator cell equivalents) in each test
sample. The TaqMan Mix assays systems used in this study
was shown to have approximately equal AE for target
(E. facalis) and reference (Sketa 2) (96% and 93%, respectively).16 Samples that showed substantial inhibition (DCT of
the SPC in the test and calibrator sample $3) were excluded
from data analyses.
Parasites. Analyses of Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts
were performed according to U.S. EPA Method 1623.17
Twenty L samples were centrifuged at UIC, and CFC samples
were sent to Scientific Methods, Inc. (Granger, IN) for analysis. Pellets were processed by immunomagnetic separation
with Dynabeads GC-Combo (Dynal Cat. No. 730.12) to
concentrate and purify the (oo)cysts. The (oo)cysts were placed
on slide wells, then stained and fluorescently-labeled with
Aqua-Glo (TM) monoclonal antibodies G/C Direct (Waterborne Inc., Cat. No. A100FLR, New Orleans, LA). (Oo)cysts
were identified by fluorescence and differential interference
contrast microscopy and confirmed to be Giardia and Cryptosporidium qualitatively based on size, shape, color, and
morphology.
Quality monitoring. In order to monitor sample handling and
laboratory performance, field blanks, method blanks, matrix
spikes and sample splits were sent to the three commercial labs
performing analyses.

Indicator bacteria by culture. One field blank was collected
after the first round of sampling at every location sampled on
a given day. Field blanks were prepared by filling a sampling
container with sterile buffer solution at the location of surface
water sampling. For qPCR and culture methods of both indicator bacteria, a 2 L grab sample was split among three
containers; two were analyzed as splits to evaluate precision
while the third was spiked with BioBall material (BTF, Pty, Ltd.,
North Ryde, Australia). E. coli BioBalls either 550 and 10 000
CFU, depending on the density of E. coli previously observed at
a given location, were used for spiking. Between 1 and 10
enterococci 550 CFU BioBalls were used, depending on the
previously observed densities of enterococci at a given location.
Indicator bacteria by qPCR. One field blank was prepared
after the first round of sampling at every location being sampled
on a given day. Field blanks were prepared by pouring 1 L of
sterile buffer solution into an empty sample collection bottle at
the time and place of water sampling. One method blank was
prepared in the laboratory for every six sample aliquots by
filtering 100 mL of PCR-grade sterile buffer solution following
the same procedure used for the field samples. The same cell
suspension used for preparing calibrator samples was used for
spiking by micropipetting spike material directly into the filter
funnel containing a 100 mL aliquot of sample water (matrix
spike) or sterile buffer solution (blank spike) before filtration In
the first half of the study the spike solution concentration was
10 000 CE/100 mL and in the second half of the study it was
20 000 CE/100 mL.
Parasites. One blank sample per sampling date was prepared
at UIC by running 20 L of sterile water through the CFC system.
Ten percent of samples were collected as splits; the first split was
processed as a sample while the second split was processed as
a spike by adding a approximately 160 Giardia cysts and 160
Cryptosporidium oocysts in a 5mL spike solution (Wisconsin
State Laboratory of Hygiene) to the 20L cubitainer before
centrifugation.
Limits of detection for both Giardia and Cryptosporidium was
one (oo)cyst per 20 litres, as one (oo)cyst could be reported for
a 20L sample. The limit of detection for both bacterial indicators
was 1 CFU per 100 mL. For qPCR analyses, the limit of quantification was 100 CCE per 100 mL.
Statistical analysis
Microbe densities were log10-transformed prior to correlation
and regression analyses. Because of the large number of parasite
non-detects, the data were heavily skewed and therefore the
nonparametric rank order correlation analysis was performed to
calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient (rs). Non-detects
were assigned values of 0.1 the limit of detection; the results of
data analysis were compared to those obtained when the nondetects were assigned 0.5 the limit of detection. Because of the
large number of non-detects, particularly for Cryptosporidium,
zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression modeling was used. This
approach allows the modeling of a continuous measurement
among a variable with many zero values,18 in our case, the
density of parasite (oo)cysts. Poisson regression predicting

non-zero parasite counts and a logistic regression predicting nondetects were simultaneously estimated. This allows the use of
a common set of covariates for predicting both values among
non-zero counts and the occurrence of zero count observations.
Multivariate analysis was performed adjusting for location
group (CAWS versus GUW) and amount of precipitation in the
preceding 48 h based on the observed associations between these
variables and (oo)cyst densities (the dependent variable).
Because coefficients were not estimable for the ZIP models of
non-detects, simple logistic regression was used to model parasite
presence, a binary outcome variable, using indicator bacteria
densities as predictors. Our interest was in comparing estimates
of indicator bacteria measured by qPCR and culture rather than
constructing a model with the greatest predictive ability; for that
reason no attempt was made to use both indicator bacteria or
both measurement methods in the same model. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results
Quality monitoring of water microbiology data
Of the 392 method and field blank samples analyzed for
enterococci by qPCR, 82.9% were undetectable after 40 cycles
(Supplementary Data, Table 1). Of the blanks, 4.1% contained
enterococci targets at densities greater than 100 CCE/100 mL. Of
the 215 E. coli qPCR blank samples, only 44.6% were undetectable after 40 cycles (Supplementary Data, Table 2). Of the
215 blanks analyzed for E. coli, 32.1% had CCE greater than
1,000 CCE/100 mL. Although E. coli targets were frequently
detected in the blanks, the distribution of E. coli in the 215 blanks
(mean CCE, 95% confidence interval) 1,222 (962, 1,682) was
distinct from the distribution of E. coli targets in the 149 surface
water samples 82,269 (29,054, 135,483), Wilcoxon 2-sided
p-value < 0.0001.
All E. coli and enterococci laboratory blanks analyzed by
culture method showed no growth. Of the 174 field blanks
analyzed for enterococci by culture, 142 (81.6%) showed no
growth (Supplementary Data, Table 3). Thirteen (7.5%) of the
field blanks had densities of enterococci greater than 10 CFU/
100mL by culture. Of the 175 field blank analyzed for E. coli by
culture, 159 (90.9%) showed no growth (Supplementary Data,
Table 4). Six of the field blanks (3.4%) showed more than 10
CFU/100mL of E. coli. No false-positive results were observed
for tests for Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts in blank
samples. Control charts, plotting the results of blank samples
(field and method) against sampling time, demonstrated no
systematic errors or trends in positive method or field blank
samples. As noted in Supplementary Data, Table 5, recovery of
(oo)cysts and of indicator bacteria by culture were within EPA
method requirements.
Water quality
A total of 294 samples analyzed for parasites were linked to both
enterococci culture and qPCR data. Of those, 124 samples were
linked to both E. coli culture and qPCR data. Of the enterococci
and E. coli culture samples, 99% and 97%, respectively were
collected within one hour of the parasite samples. Summary

statistics for the log10 transformed values for all of the organisms
are shown in Table 2. Fewer samples analyzed for E. coli by
qPCR because the analysis for E. coli by qPCR was discontinued
due to the positive E. coli blanks. Giardia cysts were detected in
86.1% of CAWS samples and 47.1% of GUW samples. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 34.8% of CAWS samples and
22.1% of GUW samples. The E. coli freshwater criterion for
a single-sample maximum allowable density for a designated
bathing beach of 235 CFU per 100 mL was exceed in 69.6% of
CAWS samples and 36% of GUW samples. The enterococci
freshwater criterion for a single-sample maximum allowable
density for a designated bathing beach of 61 CFU per 100 mL
was exceeded in 116 of 168 (73.5%) CAWS samples and 75 of 136
(55.2%) of GUW samples.
The geometric mean (GM) indicator densities summarized
in Table 2 show that qPCR GM values were 2–33 times
higher than the GM culture values. The ratios of GM were
higher in the effluent dominated CAWS samples than in the
GUW samples, and higher for enterococci than for E. coli.
Densities of indicator bacteria measured by both methods, as
well as densities of parasites, were higher at CAWS locations
than GUW locations (p < 0.05). The impact of assigning
different values to below the limit of detection (LOD) samples
for FIB densities measured by culture was evaluated. The use
of 0.5 the LOD, rather than 0.1 the LOD had a minimal
impact, increasing GM of FIB densities by about 5% for
GUW samples only.
Statistically significant positive correlations were found
between Giardia and both indicator bacteria measured by both
methods, ranging from 0.446 to 0.684 (Table 3). Currently
available statistical methods do not allow determining whether
differences between Spearman (rank) correlation coefficients (rs)
are statistically significant (the significance of difference of
Pearson correlation can be compared, but our data were not
distributed normally nor lognormally, precluding Pearson
correlation analysis). Thus, we can only comment on the size of
the rs qualitatively rather than statistically testing differences in
correlation. All rs for Giardia and the FIB (both indicators, both
measurement methods) were greater than the corresponding rs
between Cryptosporidium and the FIB. The rs were larger for
indicator-pathogen correlations in samples collected in the noneffluent-dominated GUW locations than on the effluent-dominated CAWS. Clear and consistent differences between rs for
associations involving qPCR and culture measures of FIB were
not apparent.
Logistic models were used to evaluate FIB as predictors of
parasite presence because ZIP models did not generate stable
estimates of association between the indicator bacteria and
pathogen presence. Bivariate logistic models demonstrated
associations between Giardia presence and water type (CAWS vs.
GUW), orientation to the WWTPs, precipitation, and both
indicator bacteria measured by both methods (Table 4). The
strength of associations between parasites and either qPCR or
culture measures of FIB were comparable. Cryptosporidium was
associated with enterococci (by both measurement methods) but
not with E. coli (by either measurement method). In CAWS
samples, Giardia presence (but not Cryptosporidium presence)
was strongly associated with a downstream orientation relative
to the WWTPs.

Among samples with detectable parasites, density was estimable using the ZIP models, which included terms for precipitation and location type. The qPCR measures of both indicator
bacteria were associated with Giardia density and qPCR
measures of enterococci were associated with Cryptosporidium
density (Table 5). Culture measures of enterococci, but not E.
coli, were associated with Giardia density, and neither indicator
measured by culture was associated with Cryptosporidium. An
inverse association between E. coli measured by qPCR and
Cryptosporidium was observed. Stratifying the data by location
type (effluent-dominated vs. other) resulted in unstable parameter estimates for the indicator term.

Discussion
In this study, fecal indicator bacteria measured by qPCR, a rapid
molecular method, were compared to culture methods as
predictors of Giardia and Cryptosporidium presence and density.
This study involved a relatively large number of samples
analyzed for parasite (oo)cysts and sampling from diverse water
types. Measures of the two parasites differed from one another,

with more frequent detection and higher densities of Giardia
compared to Cryptosporidium. As expected, the odds of detecting
Giardia were considerably higher on the effluent-dominated
CAWS than on the general use waters, while the odds of
detecting Cryptosporidium on the CAWS (vs. GUW) were less
dramatically elevated. On the CAWS, Giardia cysts, but not
Cryptosporidium oocysts, were more likely to be present downstream (versus upstream) of the treatment plants. Given these
differences between the two parasites, Giardia appears to be
a better indicator of human fecal pollution (from wastewater
discharge or combined sewer overflow) than is Cryptosporidium
in our setting. We compared qPCR and culture measures of FIB
in association with parasites in three ways: rank correlation,
prediction of parasite presence/absence in simple logistic models,
and, among samples that contained detectable parasites, ZIP
models to evaluate indicators as predictors of parasite density.
Enterococci (both methods) density predicted Giardia and
Cryptosporidum presence, while E. coli (both methods) predicted
only Giardia presence. Among samples that contained quantifiable parasite (oo)cysts, enterococci, measured by both methods
predicted Giardia density, and by the qPCR method,

Cryptosporidium density. Culture measures of E. coli were not
associated with (oo)cysts density, while qPCR measures of E. coli
had a paradoxical inverse association with Cryptosporidium
oocyst density. Clear advantages were not apparent for qPCR vs.
culture measures of FIB in association with parasite (oo)cysts in
rank correlation, presence/absence, and (oo)cyst density
analyses.
A prior study evaluated qPCR measures of a fecal indicator
bacterium, Bacteroidales spp., as a predictor of the presence of
parasite (oo)cysts, as well as pathogenic bacteria.19 In that study,
the rank correlation between Bacteroidales and Cryptosporidium
was 0.213 (p ¼ 0.013), comparable to that between the bacterial
indicator fecal coliforms (measured by culture) and Cryptosporidium, 0.180 (p ¼ 0.035). The many differences between that
study and our own - sites, pollutant sources, measurement
methods, measurement targets - preclude drawing firm conclusions about indicator-pathogen relationships for qPCR and
culture measures of indicators. Nevertheless, neither study
demonstrated clearly stronger associations between parasite (oo)
cysts and indicators measured by qPCR than by culture. Another
study reported correlations between reduction in qPCR measures
of indicators and reduction in measures of viral pathogens
throughout the wastewater treatment process.20 The partial
correlations reported in that study were quite high – more than
0.9 in many cases. However, associations between viral pathogen
presence or density and indicator measures were not reported,
precluding comparison to our findings. Several studies in other
settings have shown absent correlations between indicator
bacteria culture and parasite levels at wastewater treatment

plants, but weak to moderate rank correlations in surface waters
(Table 6), consistent with our findings.
qPCR measures DNA, as opposed to culturable cells. The
DNA quantified in qPCR analyses may represent DNA from
lysed/damaged cells, nonviable cells, or cells in the viable but
nonculturable state.21 These sources of DNA can lead to the
overestimation of indicator bacteria measured by qPCR when
compared with the culture-based assays by an order of magnitude,22,23 as was the case in our setting. The qPCR method of
measuring enterococci has been shown to be a predictor of health
risks among swimmers at freshwater3 and marine beaches4 in the
National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of
Recreational water (NEEAR) study. Among NEEAR freshwater swimmers, enterococci qPCR a better predictor of GI
illness than was enterococci measured by culture.3 This suggests
that perhaps the persistence of entoercoccal DNA resulted in
stronger indicator-pathogen associations than associations
between culturable bacteria and pathogens. Our results do not
demonstrate substantially stronger correlations between parasite
(oo)cysts on one hand and either qPCR vs. culture measures of
FIB on the other. This observation, however, does preclude the
possibility of stronger associations between the relevant pathogens and qPCR measures of indicators compared to culture
measures of indicators, as it is not known whether GI illness
attributable to swimming in the NEEAR study was caused by
bacterial, viral, and/or protozoan pathogens.
The detection and densities of protozoan pathogens on the
CAWS several years prior to our study has been described (Rijal
et al., 2009). Our findings from CAWS locations are consistent

Limitations
In this study, water sampling took place in a single year,
primarily in late spring through mid-summer. Sampling
throughout the year may been informative, as in other settings
seasonal changes in the indicator-parasite relationship have been
reported.24 Also, this study only measured densities of the
parasites in surface waters and did not differentiate between (oo)
cysts that were infectious and those which were not, as has been
done in other studies.10,25 The CAWS is a unique engineered
waterway in which the majority of the flow is treated but nondisinfected wastewater. Thus, our observations about indicatorprotozoan pathogen associations on the CAWS may be of
limited generalizability.
The water tested for indicator bacteria and protozoa did not
come from a single larger sample that was then split. Rather,
grab samples were collected for the indicator bacteria and
separate 20-L samples were collected at the same location, but
not simultaneously (generally within the same hour). We speculate that the indicator-parasite associations would have been

with the observation of that earlier study, which noted higher
rates of detection and greater density of Giardia cysts than
Cryptosporidium oocysts. Clear differences in Giardia cyst presence downstream, compared to upstream, of the WWTPs were
less apparent in the earlier study than in our work, perhaps due in
part to differences in exact sampling locations, weather, and the
use of the centrifuge for concentrating (oo)cysts in our study.

Another limitation is that E. coli CCE enumerated by the
qPCR method used Taq polymerase which is produced from E.
coli. This has been described by others, most recently by Chern
et al., (2011) and likely resulted in the presence measurable E. coli
target sequences in the blanks (Supplementary Data, Table 2).
Because the blanks were negative for enterococci on qPCR
analysis, field or laboratory contamination seems less likely. We
used AmpliTaq Gold; others have noted better control for E.
coli DNA contamination by using AmpliTaq Gold, Ultra
Pure.15 In retrospect the discontinuation of qPCR analyses of E.
coli was unfortunate, as, despite the positive blanks the distribution E. coli CCE values did not overlap with the E. coli CCE
values of the surface water samples. Furthermore, despite the
positive blanks, the analyses clearly yielded valuable information, as the E. coli CCE data were correlated with Giardia presence and density.
Methods for qPCR laboratory methods and calculations are
evolving. A variety of sources of error, as well as ways of
addressing those sources, are being investigated in many laboratories. Variability in nucleic acid extraction and sample inhibition can be addressed to some degree by using the DDCT
method. Contamination of samples can be identified through
blank analysis; variability can be reduced by minimizing the
number of analysts that perform DNA extraction and sample
analysis. Using reagents from the same vendor and creating new
calibrations curves with each batch of reagents should reduce the
amount of random error in qPCR results. Further method

development research may identify a threshold of inhibition for
which adjustment using the DDCT method may not be appropriate (we excluded from analyses, rather attempting any
correction of CCE values, samples with a delay or three or more
cycles). It is possible that qPCR methods that utilize propidium
monozaide (PMA-qPCR) to differentiate target sequences of
viable bacteria from other sources (non-viable bacteria, cell-free
DNA) would generate different indicator-pathogen relationships,26 particularly for pathogenic bacteria; however, this
method was not used in our study.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare
the performance of the qPCR method and culture methods of
FIB as predictors of protozoan pathogen presence and/or
density. Relationships between indicator bacteria and protozoan
pathogens are complex, and depend upon the specific indicator
and the method of measuring the indicator. Generally, the rank
correlations between indicator bacteria and protozoa appeared
stronger at the inland lakes, rivers, and Lake Michigan than in
the effluent-dominated waters. In our setting, there may be
advantage to using enterococci, rather than E. coli, as a ‘‘parasite
indicator’’ because, while both microbes were associated with
Giardia, only enterococci was associated with Cryptosporidium
oocyst presence. On the other hand, Giarida cysts are more
strongly associated with wastewater discharge (effluent dominated vs. other waters and below vs. above the treatment plant on
the effluent-dominated waters) than Cryptosporidium oocysts.
For that reason E. coli, which was associated with Giardia but
not Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts, may be somewhat more specific
as an indicator of wastewater in our setting. The relevance of
a ‘‘parasite indicator’’ may be limited, however, as recent
modeling suggests that the most common causes of recreational
waterborne gastrointestinal illness may be viruses, rather than
protozoa.27 Given that qPCR methods generate more timely
results, there is a clear advantage to using that method for
indicator bacteria measurement; our results suggest that there is
no loss in ability to predict parasite presence and density using
the rapid molecular method for indicator monitoring.
