Abstract
Aims: The goal of this study was to characterize enteric virus concentrations
and their infectivity in a variety of limited-contact recreation and bathing
waters, including Great Lakes beaches, inland lakes, rivers, and an effluentdominated urban waterway. Additionally, we evaluated associations between
point sources of human faecal pollution and enterovirus and adenovirus presence and concentrations.
Methods and Results: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and two
cell culture lines were used to identify and quantify viruses in water samples.
The presence of human adenoviruses F was strongly associated with effluentdominated waters (odds ratio 6Æ1, confidence interval 2Æ3, 15Æ7), as was
adenovirus concentration; though, neither enterovirus presence nor concentration was associated with an effluent source. Samples with high concentrations
of qPCR targets all tested positive by cell culture on both cell lines, although
qPCR target concentrations were not correlated with culture values.
Conclusions: Adenovirus was strongly associated with point sources of human
faecal pollution while enterovirus was not, indicating that adenovirus measured
by qPCR is a better target than enterovirus for identifying wastewater discharges in recreational freshwaters.
Significance and Impact of the Study: The development of monitoring for
enteric human viral pathogens at recreational waters should include adenovirus
testing. Further research is needed to interpret the results of qPCR testing in
relationship to the presence of infectious viruses using cell culture.

Introduction
Recreational outbreaks caused by adenoviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and noroviruses in ambient freshwaters have been reported (Sinclair et al. 2009). Wastewater,
combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and stormwater are
sources of viruses which could significantly impact
recreational water quality and thus threaten public health
(Kay et al. 2004; ten Veldhuis et al. 2010). Most of the epidemiologic studies of the health risks of water recreation
1250

were set in waters that support full-contact recreation
such as swimming (Wade et al. 2008, 2010). Those studies also focused on faecal indicator bacteria, rather than
pathogens associated with waterborne illness, as predictors of health outcomes. In many parts of the world, limited-contact recreation, such as fishing and boating, takes
place on waters that may be heavily impacted by human
wastewater.
The Great Lakes provide one of the largest shorelines
in the northern hemisphere for freshwater recreation with

over 500 beaches. Lake Michigan is the second largest lake
in the basin and serves large urban communities including the city of Chicago, where the river, canals and other
inland water systems are used only for limited-contact
recreational activities.
Faecal indicator bacteria are limited as predictors of
viral pathogens in recreational waters (Jiang et al. 2001;
Miagostovich et al. 2008) because of their lack of correlation with viral persistence in the environment (Boehm
et al. 2009), their growth in sediments (Byappanahalli
and Fujioka 1998), sand (Whitman et al. 2003), algae
(Verhougstraete et al. 2010), and water (He et al. 2007).
To address these limitations, molecular tools are now
being used to identify and quantify human enteric viral
pathogens in recreational waters. Xagoraraki et al. (2007)
studied the human adenovirus concentrations at the two
beaches on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan and found
that these viruses are diverse and may be useful as faecal
indicators at Great Lakes beaches, and Fong et al. (2010)
found similar results in a river system influenced directly
by sewage and CSOs. Wong et al. (2009) revealed that
viral concentrations measured by qPCR could be used to
characterize the most contaminated beach, which was in
agreement to the virus cell culture most probable number
(MPN) assays.
The objectives of this study were: (i) to describe the
presence and concentrations of human enteric viral
pathogens (human adenoviruses F, enteroviruses and
noroviruses) in recreational freshwaters by qPCR and
then by two cell culture lines (A549 and BGM) for
selected samples and (ii) to evaluate associations between
point sources of human wastewater and the presence and
density of these viruses at Great Lakes waters and a
variety of inland waters.
Materials and Methods
Sampling areas
The sampling areas for this study are shown in Fig. 1.
Wastewater from the city of Chicago was historically
discharged into Lake Michigan via the Chicago River.
In the early 1900s, a series of channels and locks were
constructed for transportation, urban drainage and wastewater discharge. This system is known as the Chicago
Area Waterways System (CAWS). Today, the wastewater
flows away from Lake Michigan and ultimately into the
Mississippi River via the CAWS. The system receives discharge from wastewater treatment plants that carry out
secondary (aerobic digestion) treatment of the sewage but
disinfection is not performed. The CAWS also receives
discharges from combined wastewater and storm water
overflows. About 75% of the annual flows in the CAWS

Occurrence of adenovirus and other enteric viruses

are generated from the discharge of secondary-treated
municipal wastewater effluent from these facilities (Rijal
et al. 2009). Limited-contact recreation activities, such as
motor boating, canoeing, kayaking, rowing and fishing,
are allowed in this system. In the state of Illinois, all
waters other than the CAWS are designated for full-contact recreation. However, local authorities can restrict recreational activities in these areas based on water quality
and safety hazards to limited-contact recreation.
Water sampling was performed from December 2008 to
November 2009, and 82 of the total 85 surface water samples were collected during water recreation season of 2009.
Sampling locations (28 sites) were categorized into 13
different surface water groups (Table 1). In addition to the
surface water sampling locations, four samples were collected at a CSO pumping station during events in August
and October 2009. Additionally, one final effluent sample
was collected at a wastewater treatment facility (WWTP).
Sample collection
Water samples were filtered through 1-MDS filters for a
total sample volume varying between 20 and 200 l (median 75 l). The volumes filtered varied depending on the
type of the water whether it was a CSO effluent or a beach
sample. Waters with turbidity <10 NTU were filtered up
to 200 l. The pH of the sample before filtration was measured. If the pH was >7Æ5, the pH was titrated to or
slightly <7Æ5 using 0Æ05 N HCl. Temperature and turbidity
were also measured. All filters were held on ice, transported to the Water Quality and Environmental Molecular
Microbiology Laboratory at Michigan State University,
and viruses were eluted within 24 h. Virus elution and
secondary concentration were performed by organic flocculation as described (USEPA, 2001a). The filters were
backwashed twice with 0Æ5 l of beef extract solution (1Æ5%
[wt ⁄ vol] beef extract, 0Æ05 mol l)1 glycine, pH 9Æ0–9Æ5) to
elute adsorbed viral particles. Subsequently, the eluents
were flocculated by adding ferric chloride to a final concentration of 2Æ5 mmol l)1 and by lowering the solution
pH to 3Æ5. The flocs were collected by centrifugation at
2500 g for 15 min at 4C and resuspended in 30 ml of
0Æ15 mol l)1 sodium phosphate (pH of 9Æ0). The
re-dissolved precipitates were centrifuged at 6700 g for
10 min at 4C. Finally, the supernatants (c. 30 ml) were collected (pellet was discarded), neutralized (pH 7Æ0–7Æ5) with
1 M HCl, filtered through 0Æ45- and 0Æ22-lm pore-sized
filters, aliquoted and stored at )80C until further analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction
Viral nucleic acids were extracted from the concentrates
and from infected cell culture using an automated nucleic

72C for 10 s, with a final step for 30 s at 40C (Roche
LightCycler 1.5 instrument; Roche Applied Sciences).
Adenovirus hexon gene (380 bp) was amplified using a
published primer set (Jiang et al. 2005) with methods
described by Xagoraraki et al. (2007). The amplicon was
cloned into plasmid vector (pCR4-TOPO) based on the
one-shot chemical transformation described in the manufacturer’s instructions (TOPO TA Cloning Kit for
Sequencing; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Plasmid
DNA carrying the cloned hexon gene was purified using
Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and adjusted to
2 · 108 copies per ll for standard stock solution, and
working standards were obtained from the serial dilutions
from the stock.
Reverse transcription was applied before the qPCR on
enterovirus and noroviruses GI and GII. Each reverse
transcription reaction mixture included 2Æ5 ll of
10 lmol l)1 reverse primer, 1 ll of reverse transcriptase
(Promega), 4 ll of 5· transcriptor reaction buffer
(Roche), 20 U of Protector RNase inhibitor (Roche) and
2 ll of 10 mmol l)1 deoxynucleotide (Roche). The reaction conditions for all three RNA viruses were the same;

the reaction mixture was incubated at 55C for 30 min
and then at 85C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme.
For the human enterovirus assay, each 20 ll PCR mixture contained 10 ll of 2· LightCycler TaqMan Master
Mix, 1 ll of 10 lmol l)1 forward primer, 0Æ1 ll of each
10 lmol l)1 reverse primer, 0Æ6 ll of 10 lmol l)1 TaqMan
probe, 2Æ4 ll of PCR-grade water and 5 ll of template.
The real-time PCR program was set to 10 min at 95C,
followed by 45 cycles at 95C for 10 s, 58C for 30 s and
72C for 30 s, with a final step for 30 s at 40C. For the
norovirus assay, each 20 ll PCR mixture contained 10 ll
of 2· LightCycler TaqMan Master Mix, 0Æ8 ll of
10 lmol l)1 forward primer, 0Æ8 ll of each 10 lmol l)1
reverse primer, 0Æ5 ll of 10 lmol l)1 TaqMan probe,
2Æ9 ll of PCR-grade water and 5 ll of template. The realtime PCR program was set to 10 min at 95C, followed
by 45 cycles at 95C for 15 s, 56C for 60 s and 72C for
5 s, with a final step for 30 s at 40C. Transcripts of 5¢
noncoding region of coxsackievirus B3 for human enterovirus and ORF1–ORF2 junction region for norovirus GI
and GII were RT-PCR amplified using published primers
(Dierssen et al. 2008 and Kageyama et al. 2003 respectively). The amplicon was cloned into plasmid vector
(pCR4-TOPO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing; Invitrogen).
The plasmid was purified by Qiagen purification kit. T7
Transcription kit was used and the product cleaned by
Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit. Linearization was
performed by digestion enzyme and checked on agarose
gel electrophoresis. The orientation of the insert was
checked by sequencing at the Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University. The target gene
sequences were compared with those published in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(Blast). The equivalent gene copies were measured by
NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer.

The plasmids were used for the development of the
standard curves and as positive controls for each qPCR
assay.
All qPCR assays were performed in a Roche LightCycler 1.5 instrument (Roche Applied Sciences). Samples
and standards were each run in triplicate. Negative
control (PCR-grade H2O without template) and an
amplification control were included in each qPCR run.
The crossing point (Cp) of each qPCR was automatically
determined by the LightCycler program, version 4.0. PCR
products were further confirmed by gel electrophoresis.
The detection limit for adenovirus, enterovirus and norovirus by qPCR was 10, 100 and 10 copies per reaction,
respectively. Because of the variation in sampling volumes
and sample characteristics, the detection limits (Table 3)
were calculated based on the average volumes filtered for
each area. For example, for a sampling area with average
volume of 50 l, the limits of detection were 120, 1200
and 120 copies l for adenovirus, enterovirus and norovirus, respectively.
Infectivity detection of total culturable viruses
Adenovirus- and enterovirus-positive samples with high
viral concentrations (copies per l) as detected by qPCR
were further analysed by cell cultures with buffalo green
monkey kidney cells (BGM) and human carcinoma cells
(A549). The BGM cells were at passage number of 170
(kindly provided by Dr. Shay Fout; USEPA, Cincinnati,
OH, USA), and A549 cells were at the passage number of
95 (ATCC, CCL-185). The total culturable virus method
as described in USEPA, 2001b, was used as the infectivity
protocol. Briefly, the cells were grown in flasks until at
least 70–90% confluence. Filtered virus concentrates were
added to the flasks and incubated at 36Æ5 ± 1C for 2 h
with occasional shaking to ensure complete contact
between the cells and viral particles after which minimum

essential medium (MEM) was added to the flasks. Cells
were maintained with MEM supplemented with L-glutamine, Earle’s salts and 2% foetal bovine serum. The
development of cytopathic effects (CPE) that are indicative of a viral infection in the cell cultures was monitored
for up to 14 days. Presence or absence of CPE was
confirmed as described in USEPA 2001b. After three
freeze-thaw cycles, CPE positive and negative samples
were filtered through 0Æ22-lm syringe filters and were
inoculated in new BGM and A549 cells for another
14 days. Samples that showed CPE at the end of the confirmation step were reported as positive for infectivity.
Statistical analysis
Virus concentrations were not normally distributed, and
categorical and nonparametric analyses were used to evaluate virus presence and concentration. The MPN values
were log-normally distributed. Surface water samples were
dichotomized as virus present or virus absent for adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Odds ratios were calculated for
the association between virus presence and water type
(CAWS vs other) and between virus presence and orienta-

tion of CAWS samples to the treatment plants (upstream
vs downstream). Statistical significance was evaluated
using two-sided P-values for Fisher’s exact test where
appropriate. The geometric mean and maximum values
were calculated for virus qPCR and MPN data. The differences between the log10-transformed MPN results for
BGM and A549 cell cultures were characterized using ttests, and correlations between the log10-transformed
BGM and A549 results were analysed with Pearson’s rho.
Other correlations were evaluated using Spearman’s rho.
The Wilcoxon two-sided test was used for comparisons
of ranked variables that were not normally distributed. A
P-value <0Æ05 was considered statistically significant. Data
were analysed using SAS ver. 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA).
Results
Viruses in surface waters
One or more of the three types of viruses (adenovirus,
enterovirus, norovirus) was detected in 39 of the 85 surface
water samples (45%). Adenoviruses and enteroviruses

were detected in 31 (36%) and 17 (20%) samples, respectively (Table 3). All four CSO samples were positive for
human adenoviruses F; three of the four were positive for
enteroviruses. Noroviruses were detected in two (2Æ3%)
surface water samples, collected from a site downstream of
a wastewater treatment plant. One final effluent sample was
also positive for noroviruses. Noroviruses detected in all
three samples were identified as genogroup II with a concentration range of 1Æ21 · 104 to 8Æ74 · 104 copies per l.
Examination of the water samples based on the type of
recreational activities showed that adenoviruses and enteroviruses were detected in 6 and 18% of the samples, respectively, in waters used for full-contact recreation and 49 and
24% of the samples, respectively, in waters used for limited-contact recreation. Concentrations of adenoviruses
and enteroviruses in Lake Michigan swimming beaches
were 1Æ10 · 102 and 9Æ29 · 102 copies per l (geometric
means), respectively. No viruses were detected in the river
and inland lake waters used for full-contact recreation.
Adenoviruses were detected in 65% of the CAWS samples
(including North side, Main Stem, Cal-Sag and the South
side) with average level of 2Æ6 · 103 copies per l, while
enteroviruses were detected in 32% of the CAWS samples
with average level of 1Æ9 · 103 copies per l (Table 3). In the
CAWS, the adenovirus geometric mean was over 103 copies
per l. The percentage of positive samples for adenoviruses
and enteroviruses at the Lake Michigan harbour was higher
than other non-CAWS locations, including Lake Michigan
beaches. In contrast, the highest enterovirus concentrations
were detected at the inland lakes used for limited-contact
recreation, such as Maple Lake (OL3) and Tampier Lake
(OL6), where concentrations were 1Æ4 · 104 and
4Æ6 · 104 copies per l, respectively. The only positive sample for adenoviruses in these lakes, OL6 was in December
2008, with genome concentrations of 3 · 104 copies per l.
Adenoviruses were detected in one of the inland lakes
(OL3) in June 2009, with genome concentrations of
1Æ6 · 103 copies per l.
Figure 2 contrasts adenovirus and enterovirus concentrations showing the graphical estimation of how the
ranges were distributed around the median (horizontal
line) in the CAWS system compared with the CSO, other
limited-contact recreational lakes and the harbour as well
as to the bathing beaches at Lake Michigan. Adenoviruses
were detected more frequently and found in higher concentrations than enteroviruses in all samples except for
the inland lakes. Lake Michigan bathing beaches where
both viruses were found was on average lower by 10- to
100-fold compared to the other areas. Adenovirus showed
greater variability across locations, with much higher
median concentrations in CSO samples than other water
types. Given the fact that we tested only human adenovirus type F, the total human adenovirus genomic copies

might be higher in these samples if tested for other
human adenoviruses.
In this study, adenovirus was more likely to be detected
in samples from the effluent-dominated CAWS compared
with the other area surface waters (odds ratio 6Æ1; 95%
confidence interval 2Æ3–15Æ7); an association between
enterovirus and effluent-dominated water was not
observed (P = 0Æ9). The ranked order adenovirus qPCR
results were greater at CAWS locations compared with
the other locations (Wilcoxon 2-sided P < 0Æ001). There
was no difference in the ranked order enterovirus qPCR
results for the CAWS compared with the other waters
(Wilcoxon 2-side P = 0Æ9) Within CAWS locations, rank
order differences were not apparent upstream (for only
two locations) vs downstream of the plants for either
adenovirus (P = 0Æ33) or enterovirus (P = 0Æ46).
Viruses in infrastructure samples
Heavy rainfall, as indicated by CSO occurrence, appeared
to be related to virus detection and concentration. The
four CSO samples were all positive for adenoviruses, three
were positive for enteroviruses but no sample contained
detectable norovirus. The one final effluent sample analysed was positive for all three viruses. The highest average
adenovirus and enterovirus concentrations were observed
in the CSO samples (Table 3).
Virus infectivity
Thirteen samples with the highest concentrations of adenoviruses and ⁄ or enteroviruses as determined by qPCR
were selected for infectivity analysis. Nine of the thirteen
samples were from sites that were used for limitedcontact, two for full-contact recreation and two samples
were from the CSO pumping station.
Culturable viruses were detected in all thirteen samples
and were positive on both BGM and A549 cell lines. The
infectious virus numbers ranged from 0Æ12 to 33 MPN
per l using BGM cells and 0Æ11–26 MPN per l using A549
cells (Fig. 3). Average virus concentration in limitedcontact recreational waters as determined by cell culture
using BGM cells and A549 cells was 5Æ5 and 7Æ6 MPN per
l, respectively. For bathing beaches, average virus concentration as determined by cell culture using BGM cells and
A549 cells was 8Æ8 and 2Æ5 MPN per l, respectively.
The log10-transformed infectivity results for A549 and
BGM cell lines were correlated with one another, reaching
borderline statistical significance (Pearson r = 0Æ59,
P = 0Æ07), despite the small number (n = 11) of surface
water samples that were tested using cell culture. The
BGM cell line displayed lower infectivity for viruses in
samples collected from the CAWS when compared with

other surface waters (t-test of log-transformed values
P = 0Æ06). The A549 cell line resulted in comparable measures of infectivity on CAWS and other waters (P = 0Æ9).
From the subset of samples analysed by both culture and
qPCR, the culture MPN and the qPCR concentrations
were not correlated. Nevertheless, the highest measurement of infectivity on the A549 cell line (110 MPN per l)
was obtained in CSO sample which had an adenovirus
concentration of 2Æ4 · 106 copies per l as determined by
qPCR (Table 3 and Fig. 3).
Discussion
This study characterized the presence and concentration
of human viruses by qPCR and their infectivity by cell
cultures in recreational waters in an urban area in the
Great Lakes basin. Adenoviruses were detected more frequently with higher average concentrations at the CAWS,
an effluent-dominated system when compared with other
sampling locations. The detection of adenoviruses by PCR
has been suggested as an index of the presence of human
viruses in the environment (Pina et al. 1998). Prior studies have showed that adenoviruses were more abundant
in sewage than other enteric viruses (Pina et al. 1998),
and their stability in wastewaters has also been documented (Bofill-Mas et al. 2006). In contrast to adenovirus
results, we found that neither the presence nor the concentrations of enteroviruses were statistically associated
with effluent-dominated waters.
The fact that enterovirus was not associated with
wastewater effluent while adenoviruses was, might be due
to differential persistence in water, particularly because of
lower susceptibility to inactivation by solar radiation.
Adenoviruses were shown to be resistant to inactivation
by UV in earlier studies (Laverick et al. 2004; da Silva
et al. 2007; Katayama et al. 2008; Mena and Gerba 2009).
A prior study of adenovirus, enteric virus and norovirus on the CAWS reported by Rijal et al. (2009) identified
comparable rates of virus detection in dry weather at similar locations to those at which we sampled (downstream
of the North Side and Calumet treatment plants). In our
study, the concentrations of adenovirus and enterovirus
that we measured by qPCR were often 10- to 100-fold
higher than in the earlier study, which utilized cell culture
for the primary analysis and PCR for confirmation, consistent with the sensitivity of qPCR compared with conventional PCR (Rodriguez et al. 2009). The rate of
detection and concentration of norovirus in CAWS samples was similar between the two studies, both of which
used qPCR measures of the virus.
The presence of enteric viruses in inland lakes and harbours in our study may be a result of nondisinfected
wastewater discharge from boats. Enteroviruses were
1258

found as frequently and in similar concentration in inland
lakes and at Lake Michigan as they were in the CAWS,
where indicator bacteria levels are historically orders of
magnitude higher. In this study, infectious viruses were
detected in water samples collected from bathing beaches
particularly at Montrose Beach (MLB2). At both Leone
(MLB1) and Montrose (MLB2) beaches, concentrations
of Escherichia coli often exceed EPA Ambient Water
Quality Criteria (USEPA 2004) according to the State of
Illinois records (http://app.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/ilbeaches/public/site.aspx?SiteID=359&Tab=Closure). MLB1 was
closed or had an advisory seven times, and MLB2 had 14
advisories (19 days) during this study period in 2009,
although not specifically on the dates of sample collection
for viral analysis. Both MLB1 and MLB2 beaches were
closed after a 2-day unusual heavy rainfall event (3–
4 inches) on 19, June 2009, which resulted in the reversal
of the Chicago River, discharging 191Æ6 million gallons of
freshwater into Lake Michigan (http://www.mwrd.org/irj/
go/km/docs//documents/MWRD/internet/protecting%20the%
20environment/Combined%20Sewer%20Overflows/htmls/
Reversals.pdf). However, the point of that discharge is
several miles away from the sampling point, and water
samples were not collected for this study at MLB1 until
1 week later and at MLB2, until 2 weeks later. Detecting
infective viruses particularly at MLB2 at this period suggests that viruses might tend to survive for longer periods
of time in these waters or that the river reversal was not
the source of viruses detected, as viruses were detected at
these locations both before the reversal as well. Bathers
themselves may be sources of human viruses at these
bathing waters (Elmir et al. 2009) as these beaches do not
receive wastewater directly or contain CSO outfalls; therefore, further study is needed to better understand the
presence of human viruses in waters impacted by nonpoint sources of faecal pollution.
The qPCR signals (copies per l) for viruses were 100to 1000-fold greater than MPN levels as measured by cell
cultures. Frequent discordant results of adenovirus analysis using qPCR and integrated cell culture-PCR were
identified in a prior study of Lake Michigan beaches
(Xagoraraki et al. 2007). Together with our findings, this
suggests that further research is needed into the relationship between virus infectivity and adenovirus detection by
qPCR. Similar results were reported in several studies
showing the differences between qPCR and infectivity
results. Girones et al. (2010) reviewed laboratory studies
which compared qPCR with the infectivity of viruses in
seeded seawater samples. The infectivity results were two
to three logs lower than the qPCR results. While BGM
cells have been long used for virus infectivity assay in
environmental samples, A549 cells could be a better
alternative for detecting infectious adenoviruses. Lee et al.

(2004) found similar results with the A549 cell line demonstrating the support of adenovirus growth. In our
setting, the lack of correlation between molecular target
concentration and infectivity in A549 cells might also be
due to the dominance of other adenovirus species within
the samples that produce faster CPE than serotypes 40
and 41. It is also possible that a correlation between virus
concentration and infectivity would have been observed if
all samples could have been analysed by culture. More
work is needed to address the use of molecular signals of
viruses for microbial risk assessment, as the dose–
response relationships are based on cultivation techniques
prior to the advent of qPCR analyses of viruses in water
samples (Couch et al. 1966; Haas et al. 1999).
Several recent studies have reported enteric virus concentrations in major cities.. Muscillo et al. 2008 analysed
14 freshwater samples for adenoviruses in Rome using
qPCR and found concentrations ranging between 3Æ4 104
and 2Æ3 105 copies per l. Hundesa et al. (2006) collected
five river water samples close to farming areas and found
all samples were positive with adenoviruses with 102 genome copies per l. Choi and Jiang (2005) analysed 114
samples in Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers and
reported that 16% were positive for adenoviruses ranging
from 102 to 104 genome copies per l. Higher virus presence and concentration in our study compared with other
studies might be due to differences in the rates of infection in the community, type of wastewater treatment,
virus transport, environmental persistence and analytical
methods. Persistence of enteric viruses in water depends
partly on attachment to suspended sediments (Muscillo
et al. 2008), distance from the source of pollution, temperature, turbidity, salinity and sunlight (Borchardt et al.
2003; Shen et al. 2008). In canals in the Florida Keys,
where septic tanks drained directly to warm saline waters
used for boating (Griffin et al. 2003; Wetz et al. 2004),
88% of the samples positive by PCR were negative by cell
culture. Our observation of infectivity in Lake Michigan
samples may be due to the persistence of infectivity in a
relatively cooler freshwater system.
This study is one of the larger analyses of three viral
pathogens in recreational waters. We used qPCR for
quantification and more than one cell line for evaluating
infectivity in the diverse types of recreational waters
(inland lake, river, engineered waterway dominated by
effluent, as well as sites at a Great Lake). Our observation
that adenovirus, rather than enterovirus, was strongly
associated with wastewater may not be true in all settings
(particularly those in which wastewater is chlorinated).
Only samples that contained the highest concentrations of
viruses on qPCR analysis were then assessed for infectivity. After evaluating surface water and infrastructure
samples for human viruses, we conclude that adenovirus

Occurrence of adenovirus and other enteric viruses

was strongly associated with point sources of human faecal pollution, whereas enterovirus was not correlated with
the source. Adenoviruses may be of use in developing
future approaches for monitoring health risk and identifying sewage sources to remediate. At designated bathing
beaches without direct sources of human faecal pollution,
concentrations of infectious human viruses were at times
high, as they were in inland lakes. This suggests a public
health risk and points to the need for more sophisticated
determinations of pollutant sources at beaches. Rapid
methods for detecting, quantifying and evaluating the
infectivity of viral pathogens at recreational waters,
including those without obvious point sources of human
faecal pollution, would be valuable.
