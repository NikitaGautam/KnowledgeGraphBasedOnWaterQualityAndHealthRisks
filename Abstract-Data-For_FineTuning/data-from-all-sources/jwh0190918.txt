ABSTRACT
Human noroviruses are a leading cause of food- and water-borne disease, which has led to an interest in quantifying norovirus health risks using
quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Given the limited availability of quantitative norovirus data to input to QMRA models, some
studies have applied a conversion factor to estimate norovirus exposure based on measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations.
We conducted a review of peer-reviewed publications to identify the concentrations of noroviruses and FIB in raw, secondary-treated, and disinfected wastewater. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the ratios of norovirus-FIB pairs in each wastewater matrix and the variables
that signiﬁcantly impact these ratios. Norovirus-to-FIB ratios were found to be signiﬁcantly impacted by the norovirus genotype, month of
sample collection, geographic location, and the extent of wastewater treatment. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of using a FIB-tovirus conversion factor in QMRA and found that the choice of conversion ratio has a great impact on estimated health risks. For example,
the use of a conversion ratio previously used in the World Health Organization Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater predicted health risks that were signiﬁcantly lower than those estimated with measured norovirus concentrations used as inputs. This
work emphasizes the gold standard of using measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in QMRA. While not
encouraged, if one must use a FIB-to-virus conversion ratio to estimate norovirus dose, the ratio should be chosen carefully based on the target
microorganisms (i.e., strain, genotype, or class), prevalence of disease, and extent of wastewater treatment.
Key words: fecal indicator bacteria, norovirus, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), wastewater treatment
HIGHLIGHTS

• It is inappropriate to use a static ratio to estimate norovirus concentrations based on measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) abundances in
all cases.

• Calculated ratios between measured norovirus and FIB differed depending on the virus genotype and FIB class considered. Ratios were
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the extent of wastewater treatment.

• The gold standard is to use measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in quantitative microbial risk
assessment.

INTRODUCTION
Human noroviruses are a leading etiology of acute gastroenteritis in patients of all age groups (Patel et al. 2009; Scallan et al.
2011; Hall et al. 2013) and have been hypothesized to account for approximately 50% of outbreaks of gastroenteritis around
the world (Patel et al. 2009). Noroviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and exposure can include ingestion of
sewage-inﬂuenced food and water, such as recreational waters, crops irrigated with treated or untreated wastewater, or
foods contaminated post-harvest during processing or preparation (Patel et al. 2009). In the United States, for example, an
estimated 58% of foodborne illnesses are attributed to norovirus infections (Scallan et al. 2011).
Given the importance of noroviruses as etiologies of disease, there has been an effort to quantify norovirus health risks due
to different exposure scenarios using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) (Barker et al. 2013; Mok et al. 2014;

Sales-Ortells et al. 2015; Seto et al. 2018; Gonzales-Gustavson et al. 2019). QMRA is a mathematical modeling tool that can
be used to predict health risks caused by environmental exposure to a speciﬁed pathogen and to evaluate the ability of control
strategies and policy recommendations to mitigate those risks (e.g., WHO 2006).
A common challenge in conducting QMRA is the limited availability of high-quality, relevant, and timely data for
some model inputs (Gardner 2004), including the abundance of the target pathogen in a source water (Mok et al. 2014;
Owusu-Ansah et al. 2017). Human virus concentrations are not commonly measured in water sources due to the technical
complexity of virus quantiﬁcation assays and subsequent cost constraints. This is especially true in resource-constrained
areas, such as low-income countries. Therefore, the microbial quality of recreational waters and wastewater is typically
monitored through the measurement of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as Escherichia coli, and the bacterial classes of
total coliform and fecal coliform (FC; USEPA 2000; NYSDEC 2014). This presents a challenge for conducting QMRA for
viral pathogens based on previously collected water quality data. To overcome this challenge, some studies have applied a
conversion factor to estimate the concentration of the pathogen of interest based on measured FIB concentrations.
An example of this is presented in the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater,
Excreta and Greywater (WHO 2006), which advocated for governments to employ a QMRA approach when developing
national regulations for the use of treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation. The WHO guidelines provided an example
of estimating rotavirus health risks due to the consumption of wastewater-irrigated lettuce and onions, in which an assumed
ratio of between 0.1 and 1 rotavirus per 105 E. coli was used as an input (i.e., 106–105 rotaviruses per E. coli). Subsequent
studies have adopted this QMRA approach for wastewater irrigation and used one of the following conversion factors to estimate norovirus or rotavirus abundance in irrigation water based on measured FIB concentrations: (i) a static ratio of 105
viruses per FIB (Shuval et al. 1997; Mara et al. 2007; Seidu et al. 2008; Machdar et al. 2013; Kundu et al. 2018); (ii) a uniform
distribution between 106 and 105 viruses per FIB (Mara & Sleigh 2010; Pavione et al. 2013); or (iii) a PERT distribution of
(106, 105.3, 105) (Fuhrimann et al. 2016, 2017).
The use of a static ratio to convert measured FIB abundances to human virus concentrations is controversial, and correlations between pathogen and FIB concentrations may not be accurate across water sources. Some studies have found a
limited correlation between concentrations of FIB and enteric viruses in wastewater (Haramoto et al. 2008; He et al.
2012; Petterson et al. 2016), given that the occurrence of viral pathogens in wastewater is a function of disease incidence
and is therefore variable, whereas FIB are more consistently excreted by the population (Ottoson et al. 2006). Moreover,
the FIB-to-virus conversion ratios previously used in QMRA may not reﬂect signiﬁcant geographical or seasonal variations
observed for noroviruses (Eftim et al. 2017). For example, several studies found higher norovirus concentrations in raw wastewater in the winter than in the summer (Nordgren et al. 2009; Montazeri et al. 2015; Eftim et al. 2017). FIB concentrations
are less likely to have temporal variation (Haramoto et al. 2006, 2008; Flannery et al. 2012; Montazeri et al. 2015), which
would cause the ratio between norovirus and FIB concentrations (RNoV:FIB) to vary across seasons.
RNoV:FIB can also be affected by the speciﬁc norovirus genotype or FIB type considered. For example, the predominant norovirus genotypes that infect humans (i.e., norovirus (NoV) GI and NoV GII) are present in wastewater at different
concentrations. Namely, NoV GII infections are more prevalent (Siebenga et al. 2009), and NoV GII have been observed
at higher densities in wastewater than NoV GI (Eftim et al. 2017). Furthermore, E. coli and FC are subcategorizations of
the class of total coliform and are therefore typically quantiﬁed at lower concentrations than total coliform in wastewater
and environmental waters. Therefore, a static RNoV:FIB would not be accurate for all norovirus genotype and FIB
combinations.
An additional factor that inﬂuences the concentrations of enteric viruses and FIB measured in sewage-inﬂuenced waters is
the degree of wastewater treatment. Viruses and bacteria differ in their size and composition and subsequently have different
disinfection and removal efﬁciencies when exposed to treatment processes. Katayama et al. (2008), for example, found FC to
be removed to a greater extent than noroviruses during wastewater treatment (noroviruses were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR)), and Tree et al. (2005) found feline calicivirus (a culturable
surrogate for human norovirus) to be inactivated by chlorine at slower rates than E. coli. Noroviruses have also been observed
to be persistent in the aquatic environment (Boehm et al. 2019). Therefore, it is hypothesized that RNoV:FIB would vary as a
function of the extent of wastewater treatment.
The ﬁndings discussed above suggest that the relative abundances of noroviruses and FIB (and therefore RNoV:FIB) would
depend on (i) the location and season that water samples were collected, (ii) the FIB used for water quality monitoring, and
(iii) the degree of wastewater treatment. Subsequently, true values of RNoV:FIB may fall outside of the range used by previous

studies to estimate norovirus concentrations based on measured FIB. This discrepancy could lead to under- or overestimation
of virus concentrations input to QMRA models, and thus a poor prediction of disease burden. To evaluate the impact of
assumed RNoV:FIB on health risks estimated by QMRA, the objectives of this study were to (1) perform a systematic review
and meta-analysis of observed RNoV:FIB in wastewater from the literature and identify factors that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
these values and (2) conduct QMRA using different values of RNoV:FIB and compare to health risks estimated by QMRA conducted using measured norovirus concentrations directly. Clearly, the gold standard for conducting QMRA is to use actual
measured pathogen concentrations as inputs. Therefore, we are not promoting the use of a FIB-to-NoV conversion ratio,
but rather assessing the impact of its use on estimated health risks.

METHODS
Systematic review and meta-analysis
A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted to obtain data on the concentrations of noroviruses and
commonly used FIB (i.e., E. coli, total coliform, or FC) in wastewater collected at various stages of a conventional treatment
system. As a starting point, the systematic reviews of norovirus concentrations in wastewater conducted by Eftim et al. (2017)
and Pouillot et al. (2015) were used to identify papers to include in the present systematic review, given that the previous
studies used search terms and inclusion criteria that were similar to the present study (described below). Five papers from
the previous reviews met our inclusion criteria: Flannery et al. (2012), Katayama et al. (2008), Kauppinen et al. (2014),
Montazeri et al. (2015), and Sima et al. (2011). The Eftim et al. (2017) and Pouillot et al. (2015) reviews included articles
that were published up until 2015 and 2013, respectively. Therefore, we conducted an additional literature search to identify
articles published between January 2015 and June 2019, when the search was conducted. The following terms were used to
search the Web of Science core collection, Scopus, and PubMed databases: ‘(norovirus OR Norwalk) AND (sewage OR inﬂuent OR efﬂuent OR wastewater) AND (E. coli OR coliform OR Escherichia).’
The inclusion criteria applied to the identiﬁed publications were the following. (1) Articles were primary research articles
(i.e., not review articles), published in English in peer-reviewed journals. (2) Article scope: articles included measured concentrations of NoV GI or NoV GII and a FIB (i.e., E. coli, total coliform, or FC) in the same sample, quantiﬁed using
clearly described and justiﬁable methods; included sample types were (i) raw municipal wastewater, (ii) conventional secondary-treated municipal wastewater (i.e., after biological treatment, such as activated sludge, but before disinfection), and (iii)
disinfected ﬁnal efﬂuent (i.e., after chlorination). (3) Assay type: included studies used RT-QPCR or most probable number
RT-PCR for quantifying noroviruses and an appropriate culture-based assay for quantifying FIB; RT-QPCR assays included
recovery controls and methods to assess or mitigate PCR inhibition. (4) Data availability: articles reported norovirus and
FIB concentrations in the form of measured individual points, means, geometric means, or medians. To be included, norovirus concentrations were required to be for a single month (i.e., means calculated over multiple months were not
included), whereas FIB concentrations could be presented as an average over time, given relatively consistent FIB concentrations over the course of the year.
After duplicate entries were removed, the literature search resulted in 76 articles, of which one – Worley-Morse et al. (2019)
– met the inclusion criteria. For the included papers, measured concentrations of noroviruses and FIB were extracted. If data
were provided in a table, they were extracted directly. If data were reported using a ﬁgure, then the individual points were
extracted using a plot digitizer (WebPlotDigitizer, v4.2; https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). Samples that had concentrations of noroviruses or FIB that were below the detection limit were not included in subsequent analyses. Treated
wastewater samples collected from treatment systems employing membrane bioreactors were not included, given that the
focus of this work was on conventional wastewater treatment systems.
Each individual sample with reported values for one norovirus genotype and one FIB was considered an individual data
point. Additional data that were extracted from papers included the month of sample collection, the sample location within
the wastewater treatment facility (e.g., raw wastewater, secondary efﬂuent, and ﬁnal disinfected efﬂuent), the norovirus and
FIB concentrations and quantiﬁcation methods employed, and the geographic location (i.e., city and country) where the study
was conducted. To ensure consistency of data extraction, 15% of the included articles were selected randomly for a second
round of data extraction by a second reviewer and compared for consistency.
NoV-to-FIB ratios (RNoV:FIB) were calculated for each sample by dividing the reported norovirus concentration by the
reported FIB concentration; each of these ratios constituted one data point. Each data point was then log-transformed to

calculate log10RNoV:FIB. Mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for log10RNoV:FIB values pooled for each of the
following categories in each type of wastewater sample (i.e., raw, secondary, and disinfected wastewater): NoV GI: E. coli,
NoV GII: E. coli, NoV GI:FC, and NoV GII:FC. No data points were identiﬁed for total coliform; therefore, total coliform
data were not included in subsequent data analysis. Statistical analysis and ﬁgures were produced using GraphPad Prism v8.
Multiple linear regression was conducted to model log10RNoV:FIB as a function of (i) the norovirus genogroup (i.e., GI or
GII), (ii) the type of FIB (i.e., E. coli or FC), (iii) the extent of wastewater treatment, (iv) the month of sample collection,
and (v) the geographical location. This analysis was conducted to determine whether RNoV:FIB was signiﬁcantly impacted
by the above-mentioned variables. The analysis was performed in RStudio (v1.4.1717) by applying the ‘lm’ command
using Equation (1), where b0 is the intercept; xi are the dummy variables used to indicate the categorical data of the virus
type (i.e., NoVGI (xNoVG1) and NoVGII (xNoVG2)), the FIB type (i.e., E. coli (xEC) and FC (xFC)), the extent of wastewater treatment (i.e., raw (xR), secondary (xS), and disinfected (xD)), and the geographical location (i.e., North America (xNA), Europe
(xE), and Asia (xA)); xmonth is a numerical month variable (e.g., January ¼ 1, December ¼ 12); and bi are the associated coefﬁcients.

Quantitative microbial risk assessment
To evaluate the extent to which the use of different assumed RNoV:FIB affects disease risks estimated by QMRA, we considered
the predicted risk of norovirus infection due to the consumption of wastewater-irrigated lettuce. Two hypothetical scenarios
were considered: (1) irrigation with a surface water source contaminated with untreated wastewater and (2) irrigation with
undiluted, disinfected wastewater efﬂuent. For each scenario, three strategies were used to estimate the norovirus concentration present in irrigation water. The ﬁrst strategy utilized the actual measured concentration of norovirus in the water
source as an input for exposure assessment. The second strategy utilized measured E. coli concentrations in the water
source and applied the conversion ratio previously used by the WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta
and Greywater (RW ¼ 106–105 viruses per E. coli) to calculate an estimated norovirus concentration; a uniform distribution
of values within this range was utilized. The third strategy also utilized measured E. coli concentrations in the water source
but applied one of the RNoV:FIB determined in the present study.
Exposure model
Norovirus doses were estimated based on NoV GII concentrations, given that NoV GII is often measured at higher concentrations than NoV GI in surface waters (Van Abel et al. 2017) and wastewater (Haramoto et al. 2006; Montazeri et al. 2015;
Eftim et al. 2017), and there is a higher prevalence of NoV GII infection than NoV GI (Xue et al. 2015). For each exposure
scenario, the daily dose (d; viruses/person/day) of NoV GII ingested by a consumer via the consumption of wastewater-irrigated lettuce was calculated following Equation (2), where CNoV is the norovirus concentration in the treated or untreated
wastewater (virus/mL); V is the volume of water that clings to the lettuce surface after irrigation (mL/g); Dw is the log10
NoV reduction during regular washing practices; Dd is the log10 reduction of NoV due to dilution of wastewater into surface
water; and I is the daily ingestion of lettuce (g/person/day). The distributions of input parameters are summarized in Table 1;
the decay of noroviruses due to ﬁeld conditions and storage was not accounted for in this study.

V was assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0.108 mL/g and a standard deviation of 0.019 mL/g, truncated at zero similar to previous studies (Hamilton et al. 2006; Barker et al. 2013; Mok et al. 2014; Owusu-Ansah et al. 2017).
Dw was assumed to follow a PERT distribution (0.1,1,2) (Seidu et al. 2008; Barker et al. 2013; Mok et al. 2014; Owusu-Ansah
et al. 2017); it was assumed that all consumers wash lettuce before consumption. Dd was assumed to be 1.478 for Scenario 1,
which followed a simpliﬁed assumption that raw wastewater was diluted by a factor of 1:30 into a receiving surface water
before use in irrigation (McBride et al. 2013). For Scenario 2, we assumed that treated wastewater was used for irrigation
directly, without dilution into surface water (i.e., Dd ¼ 0). While these assumptions did not account for complex virus fate

and transport processes that would require the assessment of site-speciﬁc conditions, we believe that this simpliﬁcation is
appropriate for the present study given that the QMRA was conducted for illustrative and comparison purposes.
Daily lettuce ingestion (I ) varies between countries. For instance, lettuce consumption in Ghana has been estimated to be
10–12 g/day, 4 days/week (Seidu et al. 2008), whereas consumption in the United States has been estimated to be 0.539 g
of lettuce per kg body mass per day (USEPA 2003). In previous QMRA studies, a uniform distribution between 10 and
20 g/person/day was used in Ghana (Owusu-Ansah et al. 2017), a lognormal distribution of (2.23, 1.62) g/kg-person/day
was used in Australia (Mok et al. 2014), and a value of 4.6 g/day was used in Japan (Ito et al. 2017). In the present study,
a uniform distribution of 5–20 g/person/day was used to account for a wide range of consumption values.

Norovirus and E. coli concentrations in raw and treated wastewater used as QMRA inputs were extracted from Hata et al.
(2013) (Table 2). This study reported NoV GII and E. coli concentrations in the same samples of raw and disinfected wastewater, collected from an urban wastewater treatment plant in Japan over a 6-month monitoring period (i.e., between October
2007 and March 2008), and was not included in our systematic review given its publication date before the start date of our
search (i.e., 2015). Hata et al. (2013) reported concentrations of NoV GII and E. coli that were averaged over samples analyzed each month. The wastewater treatment plant evaluated by Hata et al. (2013) employed a conventional activated sludge
process, followed by chlorination and sand ﬁltration. The methods used for quantiﬁcation were RT-QPCR for NoV GII (using
the COG2F/COG2R/RING2-TP primer/probe set from Kageyama et al. (2003)) and a single-agar-layer method with Chromocult coliform agar for E. coli.
For the QMRA strategies that used assumed values of RNoV:FIB to estimate NoV GII concentrations based on measured
FIB, CNoV was calculated following Equation (3), where R is the conversion ratio (either RNoV:FIB calculated in the present
study or RW), and CFIB is the measured FIB concentration (CFU/mL).

Dose-response model and risk characterization
A fractional Poisson dose-response model was employed to estimate the probability of infection per event (Pinf,event) for NoV
GII (Messner et al. 2014; Equation (4)), where P is the fraction of secretor-positive individuals in the exposed population, d is
the daily dose of NoV GII (Equation (2)), and μ is the mean virus aggregate size (where a value of 1 represents a disaggregated
state). The fractional Poisson model assumes that secretor-positive individuals are fully susceptible to the virus and secretornegative individuals are completely non-susceptible. Input parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Through an assessment of virus aggregation in the context of QMRA, Abel et al. (2017) proposed that norovirus aggregation
is less likely if the pH of water is greater than the virus’s isoelectric point (IEP). The pH of wastewater often lies between 6.6
and 7.8 (Farkas et al. 2018) and is typically greater than the IEP of NoV GII (between 5.5 and 6.9; Goodridge et al. 2004).
Therefore, and given ongoing uncertainties regarding norovirus aggregation and its impacts (McBride 2014), we assumed that
the viruses were disaggregated (i.e., μ ¼ 1). We note that the dose-response model employed herein was developed using data
for NoV GI (Teunis et al. 2008; Messner et al. 2014), and there are presently no available dose-response data for NoV GII.
This limitation is shared by other studies employing QMRA for NoV GII risk assessment.
The conditional probability of illness (Pilljinf ; Equation (5)) was estimated according to the model presented by Teunis et al.
(2008) and Mok et al. (2014), where η and r are the scale and shape parameters, respectively. The probability of illness per
exposure event (Pill,event) was calculated by multiplying the probability of illness by the probability of infection (Equation (6);

Annual probability of illness and disease burden
The annual probability of illness (Pill,ann) due to the consumption of wastewater-irrigated lettuce was calculated using
Equation (7), where n is the number of days of exposure per person per year. It was assumed that lettuce consumption follows
a uniform distribution between 208 and 365 days (Owusu-Ansah et al. 2017). Disease burden was estimated as disabilityadjusted life years (DALY) lost using Equation (8), where DB is the NoV disease burden in units of DALY per case of

Model implementation
To account for variability and uncertainty, the QMRA model was implemented using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000
iterations. For each iteration, the probability distribution of each parameter was sampled to serve as the model input data.
The QMRA model was implemented using RStudio and data preparation was performed using Excel (Microsoft). A sensitivity
analysis was performed in RStudio using the ‘cor.test’ command with Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Systematic review
A total of 365 data points were extracted from the six publications that met the systematic review inclusion criteria (i.e., ﬁve
publications from the Eftim et al. (2017) and Pouillot et al. (2015) reviews, and one from our literature search); each data
point consisted of concentration data for a NoV-FIB pair. One hundred and seventy-nine data points included measured concentrations of NoV GI, and 186 data points included concentrations of NoV GII. A breakdown of the number of data points
identiﬁed for each NoV-FIB pair is provided in Table 3.

All extracted FIB concentrations were quantiﬁed with culture-based assays, whereas all norovirus concentrations were
quantiﬁed by RT-QPCR. A few different RT-QPCR forward primer/reverse primer/probe combinations were used for norovirus enumeration by the six included papers. For NoV GI, two studies used the QNIF4/NV1LCR/NV1LCpr primer/probe
set (Sima et al. 2011; Worley-Morse et al. 2019), two studies used COG1F/COG1R/RING1-TP (Katayama et al. 2008;
Montazeri et al. 2015), Flannery et al. (2012) used QNIF4/NV1LCR/NVGG1p, and Kauppinen et al. (2014) used
NVGIF/NVGIR/NVGIP-MGB; furthermore, all of these assays differ from the NVKS1/NVKS2/NVKS3 primer/probe set
used by Teunis et al. (2008) to quantify viruses for the NoV GI dose-response model. For NoV GII, three studies used the
QNIF2d/COG2R/QNIFS primer/probe combination for quantiﬁcation (Sima et al. 2011; Flannery et al. 2012; WorleyMorse et al. 2019), two used COG2F/COG2R/RING2-TP (Katayama et al. 2008; Montazeri et al. 2015), and Kauppinen
et al. (2014) used QNIF2d/COG2R/RING2-TP. It is possible that the use of different primer/probe sets, RT-QPCR standards,
reaction chemistries, or thermocycling conditions could result in different quantitation across studies, which would require
data harmonization to best compare values across studies (McBride et al. 2013). However, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no studies that provide direct comparisons between norovirus RT-QPCR assays, and we are therefore unable to apply harmonization factors for cross-study comparison. There is, therefore, some uncertainty regarding how norovirus concentrations
quantiﬁed by different RT-QPCR assays relate to that used to develop the dose-response model; this limitation is shared by
other studies conducting QMRA with measured or assumed norovirus concentrations as inputs.
Sample types included wastewater collected along the treatment train: 202 data points were measured in raw wastewater,
101 in secondary-treated wastewater (i.e., after activated sludge), and 62 from disinfected ﬁnal efﬂuent (i.e., after chlorination). NoV concentrations measured in raw wastewater displayed seasonal variability, whereas measured FIB
concentrations were relatively similar across months (Figure 1). The included studies were conducted in ﬁve countries on
three continents in the northern hemisphere: Europe (Ireland, Finland, and France), North America (USA), and Asia
(Japan). A spreadsheet containing metadata is included as a Supplement.
NoV-to-FIB ratios
A summary of log10RNoV:FIB means and standard deviations is provided in Table 3 and Figure 2. Mean ratios of NoV GI and
GII to E. coli (RNoVGI:EC and RNoVGII:EC, respectively) in raw wastewater, averaged across all months, were 102.5+1.4 and
101.5+1.4, respectively. Both ratios were signiﬁcantly greater than RW used in the WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater (i.e., 106–105 viruses per FIB), meaning that using RW to convert measured FIB
concentrations to estimated norovirus concentrations would underpredict the number of viruses present. The average
ratios of NoV GI and GII to FC (RNoVGI:FC and RNoVGII:FC, respectively) in raw wastewater were slightly lower
(103.0+0.85 and 101.9+1.5, respectively) due to FC concentrations in wastewater typically occurring at greater concentrations
than E. coli. Given the seasonal dependence observed for measured NoV concentrations in raw wastewater, values of RNoVGI:
EC and RNoVGII:EC in this matrix displayed a seasonal trend as well (Figure 3).
Mean RNoVGI:EC in secondary efﬂuent was similar to that in raw wastewater, whereas RNoVGII:EC and RNoVGII:FC in secondary efﬂuent were slightly lower than those in raw wastewater. Mean RNoVGI:FC was greater in secondary efﬂuent than in raw
wastewater. The greatest RNoV:FIB values for all NoV-FIB pairs were observed in disinfected ﬁnal efﬂuent: mean RNoVGI:EC
and RNoVGII:EC in ﬁnal efﬂuent were 101.1+1.1 and 102.8+1.3, respectively; mean RNoVGI:FC and RNoVGII:FC were 100.52+1.6
and 100.51+2.3, respectively. This ﬁnding is due to the observation that viruses are generally more persistent than bacteria
when exposed to disinfectants (Tree et al. 2005; Hijnen et al. 2006), which results in a relatively greater number of measured
viruses per bacteria post-disinfection. A limitation to this ﬁnding is that the methods used to quantify FIB and noroviruses
have different abilities to quantify microorganism viability: the culture-based assays used to quantify bacteria are able to discern viability, whereas RT-QPCR methods used to quantify norovirus concentrations detect both viable and inactivated
viruses. Therefore, although RNoV:FIB increased in disinfected efﬂuent, it is unknown what proportion of measured noroviruses were in fact viable, and the value of RNoV:FIB in disinfected efﬂuent may over-estimate the number of noroviruses
that contribute to health risks.
While we have conﬁdence in the general ﬁnding that the ratios between NoV and E. coli (i.e., RNoVGI:EC and RNoVGII:EC) in
disinfected efﬂuent were greater than those in raw wastewater or secondary efﬂuent, there remains some uncertainty surrounding their values, given that there were limited data points available for the calculation of average RNoVGI:EC and
RNoVGII:EC for disinfected ﬁnal efﬂuent (n ¼ 12 and 10, respectively), and all were from a single paper (Montazeri et al.
2015). Future studies that measure concentrations of noroviruses and E. coli in disinfected wastewater efﬂuent at different

times of year and additional geographic regions (i.e., the southern hemisphere) are needed for an improved estimate of
RNoV:EC in this matrix.
Multiple linear regression was conducted to determine factors that signiﬁcantly contributed to the variability in
log10RNoV:FIB (Equation (1), R 2 ¼ 0.13). Norovirus genogroup, exposure to disinfection, geographic location, and month
were found to have a signiﬁcant effect on log10RNoV:FIB (p , 0.05). This ﬁnding indicates that it is not appropriate to use
one static ratio to estimate norovirus concentrations based on measured FIB abundances across all scenarios.
Inﬂuence of RNoV:FIB on QMRA-estimated risks
To evaluate the impact of assumed values of RNoV:FIB on health risks estimated by QMRA, risks from the consumption of
wastewater-irrigated lettuce were assessed using three strategies to estimate the concentration of NoV in source water: (i)
input of actual, measured NoV concentrations, (ii) use of measured E. coli concentrations paired with RW (i.e., uniform distribution between 106 and 105 NoV per E. coli), and (iii) use of measured E. coli concentrations paired with RNoV:FIB
determined in the present study. For the latter, we used average RNoV:FIB values of 101.5+1.4 for raw wastewater
and 100.51+2.3 for disinfected efﬂuent. RNoV:FIB used for disinfected efﬂuent is the ratio between NoV GII and FC (i.e.,
RNoVGII:FC); this value was used instead of the ratio between NoV GII and E. coli, given that limited data were available
to calculate RNoVGII:EC (as discussed above).
The QMRA was conducted for illustrative and comparative purposes; it was not our aim to calculate absolute risks for a
speciﬁc scenario, but rather to assess relative risks as impacted by the use of different values of RNoV:FIB. Therefore, the

estimated risks presented below should not be applied to other scenarios. Additionally, for the purposes of this exercise, we
assumed that noroviruses in solution were entirely disaggregated, which we acknowledge may not actually be the case in all
wastewater matrices. Based on analysis by McBride (2014), if noroviruses experienced some degree of aggregation, we would

expect the median infectious dose to increase and subsequent estimated health risks to decrease. Nonetheless, we expect that
the relative risks calculated using the different RNoV:FIB to be similar in cases with and without aggregated noroviruses.
The annual probability of NoV GII illness (Pill,ann) from consuming lettuce irrigated with water contaminated with raw
wastewater was estimated to be 0.038 when predicted using norovirus concentrations actually measured in wastewater
(Table 4). The use of RW to predict the norovirus concentration based on measured FIB concentrations resulted in an estimate
of Pill,ann that was almost six orders of magnitude lower, whereas Pill,ann estimated using RNoV:FIB determined in this study
was greater than that predicted by the ﬁrst strategy by approximately an order of magnitude (0.49). Predictions of the
median annual disease burden (DALY) followed the same trend. A similar ﬁnding was observed for an exposure scenario
that involved the consumption of lettuce irrigated with undiluted, disinfected wastewater efﬂuent (Table 4). Although the
RNoV:FIB values determined in this paper overpredicted norovirus exposure and subsequent health risks as compared to
using measured virus concentrations directly for exposure assessment, they performed better than the use of RW, which
severely underestimated health risks.
Owusu-Ansah et al. (2017) conducted a similar analysis to determine the inﬂuence of an assumed RNoV:FIB (i.e., 105 NoV
per E. coli) on QMRA-estimated disease burden due to ingestion of noroviruses on wastewater-irrigated lettuce and cabbage.
The authors found the median disease burden (quantiﬁed as DALYs) predicted by QMRA to be one to three orders of magnitude lower when norovirus concentrations were predicted with the 105 ratio than if the QMRA was administered with an
actual, measured norovirus concentration as an input.
Some additional studies have used alternative values for RNoV:FIB. For example, given similar concerns with the use of the
105 NoV:FIB conversion ratio, Barker et al. (2014) used a uniform distribution of 103.66–100.77 to represent RNoV:FIB in
QMRA of ingestion of wastewater-irrigated produce in Kumasi, Ghana. The conversion ratio used by Barker et al. (2014)

was determined using bacteria and virus data measured by Haramoto et al. (2006), Katayama et al. (2008), La Rosa et al.
(2010), and Silverman et al. (2013), and is similar to the range of raw wastewater RNoV:FIB determined in the present
study. Similarly, Eregno et al. (2016) and Mohammed & Seidu (2019) assumed a conversion factor of 101.06 NoV per
E. coli in QMRA of surface waters used for recreational purposes and drinking water, respectively, based on norovirus concentrations measured in nearby wastewater efﬂuent.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate which inputs to the QMRA model were most correlated with estimates of
annual disease burden (DALY). To conduct the sensitivity analysis, annual DALYs were calculated for ingestion of lettuce
irrigated with raw wastewater diluted in river water, and input–output correlations were performed using the ‘cor.test’ command in RStudio with Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient. RNoV:FIB had the greatest magnitude of correlation with estimated
DALYs (ρ ¼ 0.81), followed by Dw (ρ ¼  0.21). Correlation coefﬁcients between estimated DALYs and I, n, and V were lower
(ρ ¼ 0.09, 0.04, and 0.07, respectively), indicating that these inputs had a smaller inﬂuence on modeled disease risks. Overall,
this analysis highlights the inﬂuence of RNoV:FIB on QMRA-modeled risk estimates.
The observed discrepancies in health risk predictions that stem from estimating virus exposure based on RNoV:FIB emphasize that it is ideal to use measured pathogen concentrations as inputs to QMRA. In cases where only FIB data are available,
conversion ratios to determine virus exposure should be used with caution and selected carefully based on the data available
and local conditions (e.g., time of year; microorganism strain, genotype, or class; extent of wastewater treatment; and prevalence of infection). These ﬁndings extend to other enteric viruses of public health concern (e.g., rotaviruses and
enteroviruses). Additionally, even when actual measured concentrations of a viral pathogen are used, there can be challenges
in determining doses of infectious viruses. For example, all currently available data for noroviruses – including data used for
the dose-response model, data used to calculate RNoV:FIB, and data used for direct input to QMRA – have been quantiﬁed with
RT-QPCR, which cannot discern virus viability. An additional limitation is that virus recovery can vary between quantiﬁcation methods and is not always included in estimates of exposure assessment.

CONCLUSIONS

• Calculated ratios between measured norovirus and FIB concentrations (RNoV:FIB) differed depending on the norovirus genotype and FIB class considered, the extent of wastewater treatment, and the time of year. It is, therefore, inappropriate to
use one static ratio to estimate norovirus concentrations based on measured FIB abundances in all scenarios.
• Factors that inﬂuence norovirus disease prevalence, and therefore abundance in raw wastewater (such as norovirus genotype, month of sample collection, and geographic location), had a signiﬁcant impact on RNoV:FIB, given that FIB
concentrations in wastewater were found to be less variable.
• RNoV:FIB was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the extent of wastewater treatment, given differences in the susceptibilities of noroviruses and FIB to treatment processes. However, it remains unclear what proportion of noroviruses measured in
disinfected wastewater efﬂuent are viable, given the use of RT-QPCR for virus quantiﬁcation.
• The choice of a value for RNoV:FIB has a large impact on QMRA-predicted health risks from exposure to norovirus due to
ingestion of wastewater-irrigated lettuce. A value of RNoV:FIB previously used as an example by the WHO Guidelines for the
Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater (WHO 2006) greatly underestimated health risks, as compared to risks predicted with measured norovirus concentrations input to the QMRA model.
• The gold standard is to use measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in QMRA. While
not encouraged, if one has no option but to use a conversion ratio to estimate norovirus doses based on FIB measurements,
the ratio should be chosen wisely based on available data, prevalence of infection, extent of wastewater treatment, and
target microorganism strain, genotype, or class.
