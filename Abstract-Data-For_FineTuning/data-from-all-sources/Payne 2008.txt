What’s Known on This Subject

What This Study Adds

The US rotavirus disease burden is estimated to be high, but estimates are based largely
on indirect data. We know of no other prospective, population-based surveillance for
rotavirus in multiple US counties.

Our work presents the disease burden and characteristics of severe rotavirus illness in
the last season before the widespread uptake of rotavirus vaccine, providing important
baseline measurements.

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES. Routine vaccination of US infants against rotavirus was implemented in
2006, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention New Vaccine
Surveillance Network to begin population-based acute gastroenteritis surveillance
among US children ⬍3 years of age. This surveillance system establishes baseline
estimates of rotavirus disease burden and allows for the prospective monitoring of
rotavirus vaccination impact.
METHODS. Eligible children with acute gastroenteritis (ⱖ3 episodes of diarrhea and/or

any vomiting in a 24-hour period) who were hospitalized, were seen in emergency
departments, or visited selected outpatient clinics in 3 US counties during the period
of January through June 2006 were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical information
was obtained through parental interview and medical chart review, and stool specimens
were tested for rotavirus with enzyme immunoassays. Rotavirus-positive specimens
were genotyped by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays.
RESULTS. Stool specimens were collected from 516 of the 739 enrolled children with

acute gastroenteritis (181 inpatient, 201 emergency department, and 134 outpatient)
and 44% tested positive for rotavirus (227 of 516 specimens). The most common
strain was P[8]G1 (84%), followed by P[4]G2 (5%) and P[6]G12 (4%). None of the
516 children had received rotavirus vaccine. The rotavirus detection rate was 50%
for hospitalized acute gastroenteritis cases, 50% for emergency department visits,
and 27% for outpatient visits. Rotavirus-related acute gastroenteritis cases were
more likely than non–rotavirus-related acute gastroenteritis cases to present with
vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and lethargy. Directly calculated, population-based rates
for rotavirus hospitalizations and emergency department visits were 22.5 hospitalizations and 301.0 emergency department visits per 10 000 children ⬍3 years of age,
respectively. A sentinel outpatient clinic visit rate of 311.9 outpatient visits per
10 000 children ⬍3 years of age was observed.
CONCLUSIONS. Population-based, laboratory-confirmed rotavirus surveillance in the fi-

nal rotavirus season before implementation of the US rotavirus vaccine program
indicated a considerable burden of disease on the US health care system. Pediatrics

N 2006, A new vaccine for the prevention of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by rotavirus (RotaTeq; Merck,

Whitehouse Station, NJ) was licensed in the United States and was recommended by the US Advisory Committee
for Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics for routine immunization of all US children.1

This decision was based in part on the considerable
burden of rotavirus-related AGE on the US health care
system,2–7 primarily assessed through large linked databases (eg, national hospital discharge data) and the use
of indirect approaches to estimate the proportion of AGE
events attributable to rotavirus. Because limited population-based, laboratory-confirmed, active surveillance
data on severe rotavirus existed,8 the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) undertook such an effort. This
surveillance is needed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination through prospective, direct monitoring of the
burden of disease caused by rotavirus and the genotypes
of circulating rotavirus strains. This article presents the
results from the first season of AGE surveillance through
NVSN, which was also the final rotavirus season before
widespread implementation of the US rotavirus vaccine
program.
METHODS
The NVSN conducted prospective, population-based,
AGE surveillance in 3 US counties from January 1, 2006,
through June 30, 2006. Surveillance was conducted in
hospitals, emergency departments (EDs), and outpatient
clinics, with institutional review board approval from
the CDC and each participating NVSN site. These NVSN
sites include Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Davidson County, Tennessee), Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Hamilton County, Ohio), and the
University of Rochester Medical Center (Monroe
County, New York).
Children 14 days to 3 years of age were considered
eligible for enrollment if they presented to these health
care facilities with AGE, defined as ⱖ3 loose stools
and/or ⱖ1 episode of vomiting within 24 hours. They
were required to be residents of the specified counties, to
have experienced onset of their gastroenteritis AGE
symptoms ⱕ10 days before seeking health care, and to
have informed consent from a parent or guardian. Children were ineligible if they had a noninfectious disease
cause, were immunocompromised, were enrolled previously with the same episode of gastroenteritis, or were
transferred from another hospital after an admission of
⬎48 hours. Children who were enrolled as ED patients
and then experienced escalation to inpatient status during surveillance hours were categorized as hospitalized.
A standardized questionnaire administered to the
consenting parent or guardian collected demographic,
medical history, and socioeconomic data, and medical
chart reviews ascertained clinical data and vaccination
status. We attempted to collect a whole stool sample
within 14 days after disease onset, and specimens were
tested by using a commercial rotavirus enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA-positive specimens were analyzed by
the CDC for determination of rotavirus genotypes,
through multiplex, reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods and nucleotide sequencing.9–12 Statistical analyses were conducted by using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Comparisons
were made by using Pearson’s ␹2 test and Student’s t test.
Participating NVSN hospitals capture ⬎95% of all
1236

pediatric hospital admissions in their respective counties.
These 3 counties include ⬃85 000 children ⬍3 years of
age. Population-based hospitalization rates were calculated as the weighted number of AGE hospitalizations
with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus divided by the
number of children within the age cohort in the county
population (as determined in the 2000 US Census), multiplied by 10 000. Weights were calculated to account for
the number of days when AGE surveillance was conducted, the proportion of eligible children enrolled in the
study, and the different specimen collection rates at the
NVSN sites. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by using 1000 bootstrap samples for each rate,
with the resulting 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values as the
lower and upper limits, respectively, of the CIs.13
Population-based ED rotavirus visit rates were estimated by correcting the number of AGE-related ED visits
among children ⬍3 years of age for the 24-hour surveillance periods, to account for the days that surveillance
was not conducted in a given week and to account for
the estimated ED visit proportions at the NVSN ED facilities in the 3 counties (Davidson County, Tennessee,
54% at Vanderbilt University Medical Center ED; Hamilton County, Ohio, 95% at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center ED; Monroe County, New York,
70% at Strong Memorial ED and 25% at Rochester
General ED). The weighted totals according to month
were multiplied by the monthly proportion of rotaviruspositive specimens among study participants at each
NVSN ED, to obtain the estimated number of rotavirusrelated ED visits.14 Population-based ED rates were calculated by using the method described for the population-based hospitalization rates.
For comparison with our NVSN rotavirus-related ED
rates, we calculated rotavirus-related ED visit rates indirectly by using National Hospital Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey (NHAMCS) data. All NHAMCS ED visits
attributable to AGE among children ⬍3 years of age
between January 1 and June 30 were identified for 2003
through 2005.15 These ED visits were identified by selecting International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for AGE in any 1 of
the 3 physician diagnosis fields. SEs for the weighted
estimates were calculated by using SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC).
The weighted estimate of AGE visits among children ⬍3
years of age was multiplied by the proportion of rotavirus-positive specimens observed at the NVSN sites during the coinciding period of January 1 to June 30, 2006,
to obtain the estimated number and US rate of ED visits
attributable to rotavirus-related AGE. The National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race intercensal estimates of US children ⬍3 years of age for 2003 through
2005 were used as the denominators in our rate calculations.16
Outpatient NVSN data are sentinel and not population-based, as are our ED and hospitalization data, but
they represent an important component of the estimated
burden of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. We approximated a rotavirus outpatient rate for the United States
by multiplying the proportion of laboratory-confirmed

rotavirus outpatient visits from our 6-month period
(January through June) of NVSN AGE surveillance by
the number of outpatient visits (NHAMCS, 2003–2005)
plus medical office visits (National Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey, 2003–2005) among US children ⬍3 years
of age in January through June. We then calculated the
US rate by using the same method as used for the US ED
rates. All rates were annualized as visits per 10 000
children per year except for monthly rates, which are
reported according to 10 000 child-years. Extrapolations
to the US population were calculated by applying NVSN
rates to the annual US birth cohort of ⬃4 million.

Rotavirus Detection Through EIA
Across all surveillance sites and all provider settings,
44% of NVSN stool specimens (227 of 516 specimens)
tested positive for rotavirus. Rotavirus detection rates for
AGE inpatient and ED visits were both 50% and the
outpatient clinic detection rate was 27%, which was
statistically lower (P ⬍ .001). The proportions of inpatient, ED, and outpatient specimens that tested positive
for rotavirus were not statistically different across the 3
surveillance sites (inpatient: P ⫽ .668; ED: P ⫽ .259;
outpatient: P ⫽ .068) (Table 1).
Rotavirus-positive subjects were statistically different
from rotavirus-negative subjects with respect to age

RESULTS
Study Group
Of 1042 inpatient, ED, and outpatient children screened
for participation in this study, 838 (80%) were determined to be eligible. We obtained consent for 729 of
those children (87%), who were then enrolled as NVSN
AGE surveillance study subjects. Stool specimens were
collected from 516 (71%) of the 729 study participants,
that is, 181 from the inpatient setting, 201 from EDs, and
134 from sentinel outpatient clinics (Fig 1). None of
these children had received rotavirus vaccine.
Comparison of Study Participants
Stool specimens were more likely to be collected from
hospitalized enrolled subjects (91%) than from ED and
outpatient enrolled subjects (61% and 66%, respectively; P ⬍ .001). Enrolled study participants were statistically similar to nonenrolled subjects with respect to provider type, age, and gender, but significant differences
were observed with respect to ethnicity; 27% of nonenrolled subjects were Hispanic, compared with 12% of
enrolled study participants (P ⬍ .001), and 18% of
nonenrolled subjects were uninsured, compared with
6% of enrolled study participants (P ⬍ .001). Reasons
for nonenrollment included the following: parent or
guardian refusal, non–English-speaking, no parent or
legal guardian available, and patient discharged before
enrollment.

Rotavirus-Related Hospitalization Rate
The estimated rotavirus-related hospitalization rate was
22.5 admissions per 10 000 children ⬍3 years of age in
the 3 surveillance counties, with a 95% CI of 19.2 to
25.7 admissions per 10 000 children. Rotavirus hospitalization rates varied according to NVSN site, with 23.1
admissions per 10 000 children ⬍3 years of age (95% CI:
17.2–28.7 admissions per 10 000 children) in Davidson
County, Tennessee (Vanderbilt), 30.9 admissions per
10 000 children ⬍3 years of age (95% CI: 24.6 –36.9
admissions per 10 000 children) in Hamilton County,
Ohio (Cincinnati), and 11.8 admissions per 10 000 children ⬍3 years of age (95% CI: 8.1–15.1 admissions per
10 000 children) in Monroe County, New York (Rochester) (Fig 2).
According to age category, the weighted hospitalization rates for rotavirus were lowest for children 30 to 36
months of age (7.1 admissions per 10 000 children) and
highest for children 12 to 18 months of age (42.5 admissions per 10 000 children) (Fig 3). Comparatively, the
30- to 36-month-old category also had the lowest hospitalization rate for rotavirus-negative AGE (7.0 admissions per 10 000 children), but hospital rates for infections with nonrotavirus pathogens peaked in the first 6
months of life (54.7 admissions per 10 000 children).
The hospitalization rate attributed to rotavirus was highest during the months of February (70.3 admissions per
10 000 child-years), March (111.3 admissions per 10 000
child-years), and April (46.9 admissions per 10 000 childyears), whereas the surveillance months of January, May,
and June averaged 13.8 admissions per 10 000 child-years

Rotavirus-Related ED and Outpatient Visit Rates
In active, population-based, NVSN surveillance, 301.0
per 10 000 children ⬍3 years of age had ED visits attributable to rotavirus-related AGE. Our directly obtained
rate was higher than the 3-year average rate we calculated from NHAMCS data (171.7 ED visits per 10 000
children ⬍3 years of age for January to June, 2003–
2005; 95% CI: 136.5–207.0 ED visits per 10 000 children). Between 2005 and 2003, single-year national ED
rates from NHAMCS data ranged from 140.0 ED visits
per 10 000 children (95% CI: 78.7–201.2 ED visits per
10 000 children) to 205.9 ED visits per 10 000 children
(95% CI: 136.7–275.1 ED visits per 10 000 children).

years of age (95% CI: 199.0 – 424.9 outpatient visits per
10 000 children).
Rotavirus Severity
Rotavirus-related AGE symptoms were generally more
serious than non–rotavirus-related AGE symptoms and
were more likely to include vomiting (95% vs 79%; P ⬍
.001), diarrhea (92% vs 84%; P ⫽ .006), fever (78% vs
63%; P ⫽ .001), and lethargy (53% vs 27%; P ⬍ .001).
The average number of vomiting episodes per day was
higher for rotavirus-related AGE cases, compared with
non–rotavirus-related AGE cases (7.5 vs 5.6 episodes per
day; P ⬍ .001), as was the average number of diarrheal
episodes per day (9.0 vs 6.4 episodes per day; P ⫽ .001).
Symptoms of AGE illness for rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative AGE surveillance subjects are illustrated in Fig 5 (it should be noted that fever was not a
surveillance inclusion requirement). More than 70%
of rotavirus-positive subjects had combined symptoms of
diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, compared with 42% of
rotavirus-negative AGE surveillance subjects. A rotavirus-positive presentation of diarrhea alone was rare
(0.4%), but this symptom was present alone for 8% of
the rotavirus-negative surveillance subjects. No deaths
occurred among our surveillance subjects.

to the CDC for strain identification with RT-PCR techniques, the most prevalent strain observed was genotype
P[8]G1 (189 specimens, 84.0%), followed distantly by
P[4]G2 (11 specimens, 4.9%) and P[6]G12 (8 specimens, 3.6%). P[6]G1 was detected less commonly (4
specimens, 1.8%), and 1 observation (0.4%) was noted
for each of the following: P[8]G2, P[8]G12, P[6]G9, and
P[4]G1. Four percent of our sample had mixed rotavirus
infections with ⬎1 genotype (Fig 6).
DISCUSSION
This study clearly illustrates the substantial health burden of rotavirus-related AGE among US children and the
potential benefits of vaccination. Laboratory-confirmed
rotavirus infections accounted for 50% of all AGE hospitalizations and ED visits and 27% of AGE outpatient
visits during our 6 months of active surveillance. With
extrapolation of our population-based findings from
these 3 counties to US children ⬍3 years of age for the
purpose of comparison, our overall hospitalization rate
of 22.5 hospitalizations per 10 000 children would translate to ⬃27 000 rotavirus hospitalizations per year and
our ED rate of 301.0 ED visits per 10 000 children would
translate to ⬎361 000 ED visits per year. Our sentinel

outpatient clinic rate of 311.9 visits per 10 000 would
approximate 374 000 outpatient visits per year attributable to rotavirus-related AGE among US children ⬍3
years of age. With application to a US birth cohort of 4
million, each year rotavirus-related AGE would be expected to cause 1 in 150 US children ⬍3 years of age to be
hospitalized and 1 in 11 to visit either an ED or an outpatient clinic (Fig 7). Furthermore, children with rotavirusrelated AGE exhibited symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and lethargy) with significantly greater frequency and
intensity than did those with non–rotavirus-related AGE,
which emphasizes the severity and health burden of this
disease. More than 8 in 10 of our patients with laboratoryconfirmed rotavirus, all of whom were unvaccinated in this
baseline surveillance year, were ⬎6 months of age, when
the rotavirus vaccine series would be completed, which
indicates that an effective vaccine should prevent a substantial proportion of severe rotavirus-related disease.
Our finding that 50% of children ⬍3 years of age who
were hospitalized for AGE in January to June had laboratory-confirmed rotavirus demonstrates, as suspected,
that the rotavirus-specific International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification code likely
captures only a fraction of all rotavirus-related hospitalizations. Previous studies using health care utilization
data reported substantially smaller proportions (12%–
20%) of AGE hospital discharges coded as rotavirus.17,18
However, Staat et al,8 in direct surveillance of children
⬍5 years of age hospitalized with AGE, noted a rotavirus
detection rate of 56% during the rotavirus season, and
Canadian surveillance indicated that ⬃40% of ED visits
attributable to AGE during the winter rotavirus season
are rotavirus-positive.19 Our rotavirus detection rates are
consistent with both of those studies. Our report that
27% of sentinel outpatient AGE visits among children
⬍3 years of age were attributable to laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection is lower than the value of 40%
reported by Coffin et al20 but still indicates a sizeable
burden of rotavirus in pediatric outpatient practices,

similar to national burden estimates produced by
Parashar et al.1
When we extrapolated our active, population-based,
surveillance data to US children ⬍3 years of age, we
noted that our estimation of rotavirus-attributable US
hospitalization rates, although substantial, was lower
than recent indirect measures from national data sets,
which calculated rates for US children ⬍5 years of age of
47 000 to 67 000 hospitalizations per year4,5,18,21; the age
difference would be expected to result in NVSN hospitalization rates ⬃10% to 15% lower than these national
values. Some of the variation might be explained by the
underlying assumptions used for national data set analyses, such as assumptions regarding the proportions of
medically attended AGE cases that are rotavirus-positive. Nonetheless, our measure of rotavirus hospitalization burden seems to be considerably offset by our estimated finding of 361 000 US ED visits per year
attributable to rotavirus, a figure higher than existing
national estimates (205 000 –272 000 ED visits per
year1). In our own comparison, our NVSN rate for rotavirus-attributable ED visits was higher than indirect ED
rates we calculated from the most recently available
national data for children ⬍3 years of age (NHAMCS,
January to June, 2003–2005), although there was substantial fluctuation in national rates over this 3-year
period (140.0 –205.9 ED visits per 10 000 children ⬍3
years of age). Our single-year observations from NVSN
data might reflect the considerable annual rate fluctuations seen on the national level or might indicate other
health care utilization dynamics, such as possible substitution of disease burden between hospital and ED health
care settings at NVSN sites. Hospital and ED rates varied
substantially according to NVSN site, but the ratios of ED
rates to hospital rates remained similar (ED rates 11–15
times higher than hospitalization rates). It is notable that
the rates of ED visits and outpatient clinic visits attributable to rotavirus-related AGE were similar, and our
data portray rotavirus as posing a very large and typically

underappreciated burden of disease in the ED setting.
Overall, these data confirm that disease rates for population-based rotavirus surveillance in both hospital and
ED health care settings is needed to gauge fully the
burden of severe rotavirus-related AGE, and they suggest that additional study of rotavirus-related ED burden
is warranted.
Approximately 96% of the circulating strains we detected had either a G or P antigen directly included in
Merck’s pentavalent rotavirus vaccine RotaTeq, the current, US-licensed, rotavirus vaccine. A monovalent rotavirus vaccine which obtained US licensure in 2008,
Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), contains a single attenuated human rotavirus
strain (P[8]G1) that was directly observed in 84% of our
specimens and corresponded to either a G or P antigen
for ⬃91% of our circulating strains. Some degree of
protection against severe infection by other rotavirus
types has been indicated in clinical trials.22
Compared with US national laboratory rotavirus
strain surveillance results from 1996 –1999,23 we more
frequently detected the strain P[8]G1 (84.0% vs 75.5%).
We found a comparatively smaller proportion of P[4]G2
(4.9% vs 10.9%). Of the strains usually described as
“uncommon” in the United States, we reported fewer
P[6]G9-positive test results (0.4% vs 3.2%), but otherwise our results were comparable to national surveillance data. We detected 2 strains that have been hypothesized to represent globally emerging serotypes, on the
basis of increasing detection in recent years,11,24 that is,
P[8]G12 (0.4%) and P[6]G12 (3.6%). The single case of
P[8]G12 was observed in Hamilton County, Ohio (Cincinnati), and P[6]G12 cases were observed in all 3 surveillance areas. Children for whom mixed rotavirus infections were detected (4.0%) might have had
concomitant acute rotavirus infections or, perhaps an
acute rotavirus infection combined with rotaviral shedding from an earlier infection. Continued surveillance is
necessary to measure trends in circulating rotavirus
strains from year to year, to monitor for possible changes
resulting from implementation of vaccination, and to
assess the effectiveness of vaccination against different
strains.
Some limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our findings. First, this report summarizes
results from only 1 season of AGE surveillance. Considerable geographic and temporal variations in rotavirus
activity are known to occur,25,26 and we observed this
apparent natural variability across the 3 surveillance
sites. It remains to be seen how the impact of widespread
vaccination may modify this geographic and temporal
phenomenon in future rotavirus seasons. Second, although we conducted population-based surveillance in
counties located in Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern states, extrapolations to the US population have
been used for comparative purposes, and these locations
may not be representative of the entire US population.
Compared with the US population of children ⬍3 years
of age from the 2000 US Census, the ⬃85 000 children
living in the 3 NVSN counties were similar in distribution according to age, gender, and white race. However,
1242

PAYNE et al

children in these NVSN catchment areas were less likely
to be Hispanic (6% in the NVSN areas, compared with
20% in the United States) and were more likely to be
black (27% in the NVSN areas, compared with 14% in
the United States). Third, study enrollment was limited
to children whose parent or guardian consented to the
study in English. The difference in enrollment according
to Hispanic ethnicity that we observed led us to develop
a Spanish-language consent form and interview, to facilitate inclusion of non–English-speaking Hispanic parents or guardians in future surveillance. Fourth, because
of logistic constraints, we conducted surveillance during
6 calendar months encompassing the winter season,
when rotavirus is usually most prevalent. On the basis of
the historical seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease in the
United States, we are confident that we captured the
vast majority of rotavirus cases at these 3 surveillance
sites, although our rotavirus-related AGE rates are likely
underestimated if we failed to capture cases outside the
surveillance period. Fifth, our demonstration of disease
severity did not include a clinical assessment of dehydration status.
By August 2008, ⬎21 million doses of rotavirus vaccine had been distributed throughout the United
States.27 As the proportion of US infants vaccinated for
rotavirus increases, our NVSN surveillance platform continues to collect prospective epidemiological, clinical,
and laboratory data in hospital and ED settings and in
sentinel outpatient clinics. Using parental interviews,
medical chart abstractions, laboratory confirmation of
rotavirus disease status, and identification of rotavirus
genotypes by using RT-PCR, NVSN is uniquely prepared
to monitor the impact of vaccination on epidemiological
and clinical disease trends, to detect changes in circulating viral genotypes, and to make robust assessments of
population-based postmarketing vaccine effectiveness.
During this last rotavirus season prior to the widespread implementation of the US rotavirus vaccine program, NVSN surveillance directly confirms the rotavirusrelated AGE has a significant health burden among US
children. This provides important baseline information
on the epidemiological and clinical features of severe
rotavirus-related AGE, should allow assessment of the
impact of vaccination in the future.
