Background. Enteroviruses are shed in human stool and can cause a wide spectrum of illness. They are the
leading cause of aseptic meningitis.
Methods. In 2004, the Connecticut Department of Public Health investigated a meningitis cluster among
persons returning from a school-organized trip to Mexico.
Results. Among 29 travelers (25 teenagers and 4 adult chaperones), 21 became acutely ill. Viral culture and
nucleic acid amplification testing of stool (n p 27 ) and cerebrospinal fluid (n p 4) specimens identified enteroviral
infection in 20 of 28 travelers from whom any specimen was obtained; 4 had echovirus 30 only, 11 had coxsackievirus
(CV) A1 only, 4 had both echovirus 30 and CVA1, and 1 had CVA5 only. Illness onset dates were tightly clustered
4 days after a prolonged swim in the Gulf of Mexico. Time spent swimming was significantly associated with the
odds of enteroviral infection (univariate odds ratio for each additional hour swimming, 14.3; 95% confidence
interval, 1.3–154.3). Headache, fever, vomiting, and nausea occurred more frequently among the echovirus 30–
infected travelers than among the uninfected control subjects (P ! .05 ). The most frequent symptoms among
travelers infected with only CVA1 identified were nausea and diarrhea (36% each), but neither was significantly
associated with CVA1 infection; 5 patients with CVA1 infection were asymptomatic.
Conclusions. We identified multiple enteroviruses among the travelers. Clustered illness onsets suggest pointsource exposure, which likely was a sea swim in sewage-contaminated seawater. Novel molecular amplification
and sequencing methodologies were required to recognize the rarely identified CVA1, but it is ambiguous whether
CVA1 infection caused illness. Travelers should be aware of risks associated with swimming in natural waters when
visiting areas where there is limited sewage treatment.
Enteroviruses (EVs) cause 10–15 million symptomatic
infections in the United States annually [1], and EV
infection can be acquired through ingestion of infectious fecal material and oral or respiratory secretions
[2, 3]. Transmission is more frequent in places where

routine hygiene is limited (e.g., where there is no running water for hand washing) [3], because EV is shed
in stool for weeks after infection [2]. Transmission is
markedly seasonal in temperate regions, but incidence
in tropical and subtropical areas is high throughout the
year. EVs cause a wide illness spectrum, from asymptomatic infections to encephalitis [2], and are the leading cause of aseptic meningitis in developed countries
[3]. Approximately 90 serotypes are recognized [4].

Historically, virus isolation has been used to diagnose EV
infection, usually through fecal, respiratory, or CSF specimen
inoculation into cell cultures (primary or continuous cell lines)
or suckling mice. Isolates are identified using serotype-specific
neutralizing antibodies [5]. Unfortunately, viral culture is slow
and labor intensive and usually cannot produce a result within
a clinically relevant time. Furthermore, certain EV serotypes
replicate poorly, if at all, in commonly used cell lines, and use
of suckling mice in clinical diagnostics has decreased sharply
in recent years. More recently, clinical laboratories have adopted
nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g., RT-PCR), using
primers targeted to highly conserved EV genome regions [6].
These methods are highly specific and sensitive and can detect
virus directly in clinical specimens. Molecular methods are also
now widely used for EV typing; RT-PCR amplifies a portion
of the genome’s capsid-coding region (usually the region encoding major viral capsid protein 1 [VP1]), and the PCR product sequence is compared with reference sequences of known
serotypes [7].
Although risk of poliomyelitis among nonimmunized travelers to tropical, developing countries is well documented [8],
other travel-related EV disease has not been frequently reported, perhaps because of low clinical attack rates and nonspecific symptoms. We report an investigation of an outbreak
of nonpolio EV disease among travelers to Mexico that included
use of novel laboratory detection methods for the determination of etiologic outcome.
On 30 June 2004, the director of the Yale-New Haven Hospital Clinical Virology Laboratory contacted the Connecticut
Department of Public Health to notify of 2 high school students
hospitalized with confirmed EV meningitis after a schoolorganized religious trip to Mexico that involved 29 travelers.
The Connecticut Department of Public Health conducted an
investigation to determine the extent of the outbreak, to implement immediate infection-control measures, and to improve
understanding of such outbreaks to aid in future prevention
efforts.
METHODS
To identify potentially related illnesses outside the 29 trip participants, we contacted the youth organization that organized
the school’s trip, notified the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and posted a case inquiry on Epi-X, the
CDC’s national epidemic information exchange for public
health officials.
All trip participants were interviewed regarding religious mission–related and recreational activities, food and drink exposures, hygienic practices during the 10 days of their trip, and
any symptoms of illness during their trip or 2 weeks after
returning from the trip. We obtained menu lists for all meals;
all meals were eaten as a group. Travelers were requested to

provide stool specimens, which underwent culture for EV at
the Connecticut Department of Public Health (Hartford) and
were tested by EV-specific nucleic acid sequence–based amplification (NASBA) at Yale-New Haven Hospital (New Haven,
CT) and by EV VP1 seminested RT-PCR (RT-snPCR) at the
CDC (Atlanta, GA). Available CSF specimens (n p 4 ) collected
for treatment purposes were forwarded to the CDC for VP1
RT-snPCR.
Stool culture. A stool-coated sterile swab was added to 1
mL of inoculation minimal essential media containing 2% fetal
bovine serum; the tube was vortexed for 10 s. Then, 0.1 mL
of the resulting stool suspension was added to each cell culture
tube (cell lines were primary monkey kidney, normal human
fibroblast, and A549); these tubes were placed on a rocker
platform at 33C for ⭓1 h. An additional 1 mL of inoculation
minimal essential media was added to all tubes before incubation at 33C in humidified 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.
Tubes were inspected daily. When typical EV cytopathic effect
was observed, cells were tested by indirect immunofluorescence
with EV group–specific monoclonal antibodies. EV-positive
isolates were serotyped using indirect immunofluorescence with
monoclonal antibodies specific for individual EV serotypes
(Millipore).
NASBA. NucliSens basic kit (bioMérieux) was used for EV
RNA extraction and detection in accordance with the manufacturer’s EV NASBA protocol [9]. RNA was isolated from 100
mL (stool) or 200 mL (CSF) of specimen with use of a modified
Boom method [10] with Nuclisens kit reagents. BioMérieux’s
EV-specific internal control (i.e., cloned EV sequences containing a 20-bp potato-leaf-roll virus fragment) was added to
each specimen to evaluate RNA extraction and amplification
efficiency. EV amplification products were detected by hybridization in 2 separate reactions using 2 different probes, 1 of
which was specific for the EV product and 1 of which was
specific for internal control product; both contained generic
ruthenium-labeled electrochemiluminescence detection probe.
EV VP1 RT-snPCR. EV VP1-specific RT-PCR and sequencing were conducted as described elsewhere [11]. Fecal specimens were pretreated by extraction of a 10% suspension with
0.1 mL chloroform, followed by extraction with 1 mL Vertrel
XF (Miller-Stephenson Chemical). RNA was extracted from
clinical specimens, fecal extracts, and virus isolates with use of
the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
cDNA was synthesized with use of primers in the VP1 capsid
protein–encoding genome region. PCR was performed using
degenerate, inosine-containing primers in the genome region
encoding VP3 and VP1 capsid proteins, to produce an ∼700–
base pair first-round product. One microliter of the first PCR
product was added to a second PCR containing degenerate
primers (both within VP1), resulting in a 320–350-base pair
product. Reaction products were separated and visualized on

agarose gel and were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen). Resulting DNA templates were sequenced with
the same primers with use of Big Dye Terminator, version 1.1,
Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit on an ABI Prism 3100
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Amplicon sequences were compared with VP1 sequences of
EV reference strains, including ⭓1 representative of each recognized serotype, by script-driven sequential pairwise comparison, using Gap (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 10.3; Accelrys), as described elsewhere [12–14]. A partial
VP1 nucleotide sequence identity of 175% confirmed the serotype in the specimen.
Data analysis. Travelers with EV identified by culture,
NASBA, or PCR in any specimen were considered to have EV
infection. Travelers with a specimen available and no evidence
of EV infection by laboratory testing were considered to not
have EV infection. Symptoms were not used to classify travelers
as infected or uninfected because of the wide illness spectrum
that can result from EV infection, including asymptomatic infections and the possibility of other similar concurrent travelrelated illnesses.
An epicurve was constructed by plotting acute illnesses
among travelers with onset during the trip or 2 weeks after the
group’s return. Epicurve boxes were marked with laboratory
results for each ill traveler and their symptom group. Two
symptom groups were developed—a group with headache and/
or vomiting and a group with diarrhea but not headache or
vomiting—to separate those with symptoms potentially consistent with traveler’s diarrhea from those with symptoms more
consistent with viral meningitis (i.e., headache and/or
vomiting).
To report the symptomatology of the 2 predominant EV
infections (i.e., echovirus [E] 30 and coxsackievirus [CV] A1),
618 • CID 2008:47 (1 September) • Begier et al.

we calculated the frequencies of symptoms in the groups of
patients stratified by laboratory results (i.e., all patients infected
with E30, patients infected with only E30, all patients infected
with CVA1, patients infected with only CVA1, and patients who
had no EV detected). The groups of all patients infected with
E30 and all patients infected with CVA1 were used to create
larger comparison groups to increase statistical power. Fisher’s
exact test was used to identify statistically significant associations between symptoms and outcomes for patients infected
with specific EVs, compared with control subjects who did not
have EV detected.
For analysis of risk factors, 3 travelers with illness onset after
27 June were excluded, because they likely contracted infection
from other ill trip members (i.e., these illnesses were secondary
cases); this determination was based on delayed symptom timing after the primary illness peak (figure 1). Because of excluded
cases, analysis of risk factors was conducted as a nested casecontrol study rather than as a cohort study. Univariate ORs for
EV infection were calculated for all exposures. Because of small
numbers, Fisher’s exact test was used to test for statistical significance of dichotomous variables, the Mann-Whitney 2-sample statistic was used for continuous variables, and Cuzick’s
nonparametric test for trend across ordered groups was used
for trend testing. This outbreak investigation underwent human
subjects review at the CDC and was determined to be public
health practice rather than research activity (HSR #200400293).
RESULTS
Outbreak time course. Of the 29 travelers (25 teenagers and
4 adult chaperones), 21 (72%) became ill. An epicurve (figure
1) with all illnesses depicted by onset date shows a sharp peak



in onset of illness; most illnesses occurred within 3 days after
return to the United States. A small, presumably secondary
illness peak occurred 4 days after the primary peak. Of the 21
ill travelers, 14 (67%) had headache or vomiting and 7 (33%)
had diarrhea but not headache or vomiting (figure 1).
Laboratory results. Twenty-seven travelers (including 20 of
the 21 ill travelers) provided stool samples (figure 2). E30 was
yielded by culture in 5 stool specimens; no other EVs were
identified by culture. EV was identified in the same 18 stool
samples by both NASBA and VP1 RT-snPCR. CVA1 was identified in 15 samples, and E30 was identified in 3 samples. Only
1 EV was identified in each stool sample by VP1 RT-snPCR;
this method usually identifies only the most abundant EV in
the sample and not necessarily all EVs present. Among 5 stool
samples that were culture positive for E30, VP1 RT-snPCR
identified CVA1 in 4 and E30 in 1. Among 4 CSF samples
obtained, VP1 RT-snPCR identified E30 in 3 and CVA5 in 1.
One E30-positive CSF samples was from an ill traveler who did
not have a stool sample obtained. Overall, on the basis of all
of the testing performed for 28 travelers, 4 travelers had only
E30 identified, 11 had only CVA1 identified, 4 had both E30
and CVA1 identified, 1 had CVA5 identified, and 8 had no EV
identified (figure 2).
The mean duration from onset of illness to sample collection
was similar for NASBA- and PCR-negative samples and
NASBA- and PCR-positive samples (10 and 11 days, respectively; P p .332, by Mann-Whitney comparison of means).

Bacterial stool cultures were performed for the 7 travelers who
had diarrhea only (figure 1). One culture yielded Salmonella
enterica serotype Kentucky; the results of the other cultures
were negative.
Symptoms. The frequencies of symptoms stratified by the
travelers’ results of testing for EV (excluding the traveler who
had only CVA5 identified) are presented in table 1. Headache,
nausea, vomiting, and subjective fever were the most frequent
symptoms among the 8 travelers with E30 infection and were
significantly more frequent among this group than among the
EV-negative travelers. Among 11 travelers who had only CVA1
identified, diarrhea and nausea were the most frequent symptoms (frequency for both, 36%). Five infected travelers (all
infected with CVA1 only) were not ill, and thus, data for them
are not shown in figure 1, which plots travelers according to
the date of illness onset.
Risk factors for infection. Activities significantly associated
with EV infection were playing soccer with villagers during the
afternoon of arrival in the fishing village (OR, 12.5; 95% CI,
1.2–168.8) and swimming in the Gulf of Mexico during a trip
to a nearby island (OR for each additional hour spent swimming that day, 14.3; 95% CI, 1.3–154.3). The soccer game
occurred 7 days before the primary illness peak; the swimming
occurred 4 days before this peak. Because no increase in the
risk of infection was found with increased time spent playing
soccer and because the timing of the sea swim exposure
matched the incubation period estimated for our secondary

NOTE. Presence of echovirus (E) 30 or coxsackievirus (CV) A1 was determined by stool culture, stool PCR, or CSF PCR. Of
the 28 travelers who had their specimens tested for enterovirus, 2 were excluded from this analysis (1 of whom did not have
a clinical specimen obtained, and 1 of whom had CVA5 identified in a CSF sample and had no evidence of E30 or CVA1 infection).

cases (i.e., the 4 days between illness peaks), we considered sea
swimming to be the likely source of the outbreak and focused
additional analysis on this. Despite extensive analysis of individual menu items, meals, and drinks, no food or drink exposures were associated with increased risk of infection. Seventeen (59%) of the 29 travelers reported always using hand
sanitizer before meals; hand sanitizer use before meals was not
associated with lower risk of EV infection.
Table 2 shows associations between EV infection and seawater exposure during the travelers’ swim on 21 June 2004.
ORs under “All travelers” are for associations between seawater
exposure and EV infection, comparing EV-positive patients
with EV-negative control subjects; 3 patients with secondary
cases were excluded from this comparison. Only 3 travelers did
not swim, but 2 of these travelers, including the only infected
patient who did not swim, visited the beach with other travelers.
All sea swimming exposures were associated with increased risk
of EV infection, but only the time spent swimming was significantly associated with increased risk of EV infection, as
noted previously.
Both EV-negative control subjects who swallowed seawater
had diarrheal illnesses with onset during the primary illness
peak. Table 2 also shows an analysis of associations between

infection and seawater exposure, with the exclusion of ill EVnegative travelers from the control group (i.e., EV-positive patients vs. well EV-negative control subjects). All associations
had higher estimates for risk of seawater exposure than those
calculated when ill control subjects were included. A statistically
significant trend toward increased risk of EV infection was
observed for swallowing seawater (OR, 16.0), compared with
swimming without recalling any swallowing of water (OR, 12.0)
and with not swimming at all (OR, 1.0 [reference]; P p .040,
by Cuzick’s nonparametric trend test)
DISCUSSION
We report an outbreak of primarily EV illnesses associated with
youth-group travel to Mexico. Illness onset dates were tightly
clustered, consistent with point-source exposure. Laboratory
testing identified multiple pathogens (E30, CVA1, CVA5, and
S. Kentucky), all of which were shed in infected human feces.
Analysis of exposures suggests that a sea swim 4 days before
the primary illness peak was the infection source, likely because
of sewage-contaminated seawater. To our knowledge, this is the
first reported outbreak of EV infection associated with seawater
swimming. Furthermore, this is only the second reported out-

break in which CVA1 infection was confirmed, requiring novel
laboratory methodologies for identification (although whether
CVA1 caused illness is unclear).
The high morbidity observed among these travelers was likely
because of E30 infection. Asymptomatic and mild infections
are reportedly representative of most EV infections [1]. However, published reports [15, 16] documented high rates of
symptomatic disease in other outbreaks of E30 infection. Two
investigations of child-care center–associated outbreaks of E30
infection found that 52%–59% of adults with serologically confirmed E30 infection were symptomatic and that 18%–21% had
meningitis [15, 16]. In accordance with the known predisposition of E30 to cause more cases of aseptic meningitis than
do other EVs [17], we found that only meningitis-associated
symptoms (i.e., headache, fever, vomiting, and nausea) were
significantly associated with E30 infection. We did not identify
any asymptomatic E30 infections.
In contrast, it is ambiguous whether CVA1 infection caused
any illness. The only prior documented CVA1-associated outbreak was an outbreak of diarrhea among immunocompromised children who had recently undergone bone marrow
transplantations [18, 19]. CVA1 was also identified in a single
student traveler to Mexico who had low-grade fever, chills,

nausea, and diarrhea in a small study that investigated the viral
etiologies of traveler’s diarrhea [20]. Similarly, the most frequent symptoms in our investigation among those who had
only CVA1 identified were nausea and diarrhea (frequency for
each, 36%); however, neither symptom was significantly associated with CVA1 infection, and 5 patients were asymptomatic. However, small numbers likely limited our ability to identify significant associations with specific symptoms. Notably,
CVA1 was not found in any CSF sample, suggesting that CVA1
likely was not a cause of viral meningitis in this cohort.
Historically, CVA1 has had a wide geographic distribution
[21], but only 9 cases of CVA1 infection have been reported
to the National Enterovirus Surveillance System since the establishment of the voluntary passive system in 1970 [22]. CVA1
grows poorly in cell culture, and isolation generally requires
inoculation of suckling mice [23, 24]. Currently, suckling mice
are infrequently used for viral diagnostics; thus, few clinical
laboratories can detect CVA1. Until this outbreak, the CDC
identified CVA1 only 6 times since 1962 (last in 1982), always
by suckling-mouse inoculation.
The new, ultrasensitive VP1 RT-snPCR assay allows detection
and identification of noncultivable EVs without sucklingmouse inoculation [11]. The EV genome was detected with

equivalent sensitivity with use of NASBA at Yale-New Haven
Hospital’s Clinical Virology Laboratory. EV genus–specific
NASBA and RT-PCR are increasingly available in clinical laboratories, allowing greater sensitivity in detecting EV. Illustratively, only 5 of 18 NASBA-positive samples were viral culture
positive. However, the genome region targeted by genus-specific
molecular assays commonly used in clinical laboratories cannot
differentiate serotypes [7].
The steep primary illness peak indicates a point-source exposure. The secondary illness peak occurred 4 days after the
first, indicating a 4-day incubation period (which is within the
usual 3–6-day incubation period for EV [2]). Four days before
the primary illness peak, the group participated in a prolonged
sea swim. All seawater exposures were associated with increased
risk of EV infection; time spent swimming was significantly
associated with infection. CVA1 and E30, as well as S. Kentucky
and the other pathogens, were likely present in the same fecescontaminated seawater, resulting in this outbreak of mixed
infection.
We removed travelers with diarrheal illnesses from the control group, because such illnesses might have been caused by
infections due to other undetected pathogens for which we did
not test (i.e., other enteric viruses) that resulted from the same
exposure (i.e., sewage-contaminated seawater). Including patients with such illnesses in the control group might have hindered the identification of risk factors for illness. Removing
patients with these illnesses from the control group increased
point estimates for all seawater exposure associations, supporting our hypothesis that sea swimming caused this outbreak.
Furthermore, a significant trend in increasing risk of infection
was observed for swallowing seawater, compared with swimming without swallowing water and with not swimming.
Although outbreaks of EV infection resulting from sea swimming have not been reported previously, other contaminated
natural waters have been implicated in other outbreaks of EV
infection [25, 26]; inadequately chlorinated contaminated
swimming pools have also been implicated [27–29]. E30-contaminated river water and groundwater sources were implicated
in a drinking water–associated outbreak of E30 infection [30],
illustrating the ability of E30 to remain viable in natural waters.
In addition, other viral infections resulting from seawater exposure have been documented in multiple studies [31, 32].
During this outbreak, seawater may have become contaminated from raw sewage disposal relatively near shore, resulting
in observed EV illness and other enteric illnesses after sea swimming. Environmental agencies have been concerned about sewage treatment and disposal practices in the Gulf of Mexico [33],
particularly in Mexico’s Quintana Roo state [34], which was
this group’s destination. Travelers should be aware of risks associated with swimming in natural waters when visiting areas
with limited sewage treatment. Travelers should avoid swim622 • CID 2008:47 (1 September) • Begier et al.

ming in oceans and lakes (1) near urban areas where sewage
might be inadequately treated; (2) after heavy rainfalls, which
may overwhelm sewage systems, causing increased natural-water contamination; and (3) near water outflows (i.e., pipes or
rivers), because such outflows can bring contaminated water
into swimming areas [35].
The primary limitation of our investigation is the small number of travelers in the group; this likely affected our ability to
identify statistically significant associations and precluded multivariate analysis. Furthermore, all but 3 travelers swam in the
seawater; this limited our power to identify statistically significant associations between seawater exposure and EV infection.
Finally, we were unable to test the seawater for EV because of
the site’s distance and because of the time elapsed between
exposure and recognition of the probable exposure source. We
also did not test stool samples from travelers for other viral
agents that may have caused diarrheal symptoms.
In summary, we report high morbidity associated with an
outbreak of EV disease among travelers to Mexico that likely
occurred as a result of swimming in sewage-contaminated seawater. Travelers and physicians who advise them should be
aware of health risks associated with global recreational water
use and of ways to reduce risk. Finally, EV VP1 RT-snPCR is
a new methodology that will likely assist in real-time etiologic
outcome assessment of future outbreaks of EV infection.
