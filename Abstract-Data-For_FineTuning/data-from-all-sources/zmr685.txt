INTRODUCTION

E

nterococci are important members of gut communities in
many animals (e.g., see references 82, 86, 87, 101, 105, 144,
195, 202, and 240) and opportunistic pathogens that cause millions of infections annually (231, 233). Their abundance in human
and animal feces, the ease with which they are cultured, and their
correlation with human health outcomes in fresh and marine waters have led to their widespread use as tools for assessing recreational water quality worldwide (333, 335, 345–347). The enterococci are most frequently used as fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), or
general indicators of fecal contamination, but they are also used as
surrogates for pathogens and/or health effects in risk assessment
and other modeling applications (61, 214, 285, 303, 329, 346).
Research spanning more than 3 decades, however, has shown that
these bacteria are widely distributed in a variety of environmental
habitats, even when there is little or no input from human and/or
animal fecal sources. These extraenteric habitats include soil and
sediments, beach sand, aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, and ambient waters (rivers, streams, and creeks); they may also be considered heterothermic habitats, in which temperatures are variable, in contrast to the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded
animals, where the temperature is relatively constant.
The overall goal of this review of enterococci is to present the
reader with an understanding of (i) the taxonomy and phylogeny,
(ii) the microbial ecology (occurrence, persistence, and survival in
nonenteric habitats), and (iii) the use of these bacteria in protecting human health from waterborne illnesses. In this review, unless

otherwise stated, we define “environmental enterococci” as those
bacteria found in a variety of extraenteric habitats, such as ambient waters, aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, beach sand, soil, and
sediments.
ENTEROCOCCI AND THE GENUS ENTEROCOCCUS

Previously classified in the genus Streptococcus, the enterococci
were proposed to be a division comprised of bacteria that generally grow at temperatures of between 10°C and 45°C in 6.5% NaCl
at pH 9.6 and to survive at 60°C for 30 min (66, 68, 218, 293). This
classification scheme, proposed previously by Sherman (293),
correlated with a serological scheme developed by Lancefield in
the 1930s, wherein the enterococci reacted with group D antisera
whereas nonenterococcal streptococci reacted with antiserum
group A, B, C, E, F, or G (198). In 1984, Enterococcus was proposed
as a unique genus, separate from Streptococcus, when DNA-DNA
and DNA-rRNA hybridization revealed that species such as Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium (now Enterococcus faecalis and E.
faecium, respectively) were relatively distantly related to nonenterococcal streptococci such as Streptococcus bovis (67, 283). Pres-

ently, there are 36 known Enterococcus species, classified into five
groups (Table 1).
We have adopted the following conventions of nomenclature
and terminology. When referring to a confirmed member of the
genus Enterococcus, the technical genus and/or species (e.g., E.
faecalis) or the inclusive equivalent (Enterococcus sp. or spp.) is
used. When referring to organisms that are identified only by isolation and the correct phenotype on selective-differential medium, the generic term “enterococci” is employed. Finally, in
older publications where designations such as “fecal streptococci”
or previous species names (e.g., S. faecalis or S. faecium) were used,
we employ that terminology with the understanding that the
terms, especially fecal streptococci, are largely synonymous with
enterococci. The term “intestinal enterococci,” used by the European Union to describe the FIB group used for water quality assessments, is largely interchangeable with enterococci (363) but
has been defined by biochemical characteristics set by the International Organization for Standardization (168).

It is noteworthy that the early classification system proposed by
Sherman (293) is occasionally still used today to differentiate enterococci from nonfecal streptococci as well as to identify enterococci based upon reactions to group D and, in some cases, group Q
antisera (241, 257). Enterococci are spherical or ovoid cells arranged in pairs or chains (144, 241). The enterococci are Gram
positive, non-spore-forming, obligately fermentative chemoorganotrophs. They are catalase negative, although some species
produce pseudocatalase, and they are usually homofermentative,
producing lactic acid (144, 192, 241). Motility differs among species; e.g., E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus are motile, and E. asini
and E. phoeniculicola are not (66, 86, 202). Pigmentation also differs among species; i.e., yellow-pigmented species include E. sulfureus, E. casseliflavus, and E. mundtii (66, 218), and pigmented
species are commonly found among plants (1). Enterococci are
also found in the gut of insects (e.g., Drosophila) (70). The known
habitats of various Enterococcus spp. are catalogued in Table 1, but
it is important to note that as more environmental habitats are

explored, and as methods for the identification of organisms to the
species level become less labor-intensive and more standardized,
the list of known habitats for members of the genus Enterococcus
will doubtless increase.
In general, enterococci are commensal bacteria, potentially
helping in digestion and other gut metabolic pathways. Some Enterococcus spp., such as E. faecium and E. faecalis, are used in probiotics to treat diarrhea and improve host immunity (108). While
most species of Enterococcus are commensal organisms, some species are opportunistic human pathogens. E. faecalis and E. faecium
have become particularly important etiological agents of nosocomial infections (231, 233), including urinary tract infections, endocarditis, bacteremia, neonatal infections, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and abdominal and pelvic infections (231,
241). Of particular concern is the intrinsic antibiotic resistance
among certain species, particularly resistance to aminoglycosides
and cephalosporins, or acquired resistance to many others, most
prominently vancomycin (233, 325). While E. faecalis is the species most commonly implicated in nosocomial infections, E. faecium has shown resistance to the widest array of antibiotics (233,
325), and E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E.
raffinosus have been isolated from patients diagnosed with enterococcal infections (241). Because of their near-ubiquitous distribution in the feces of animals, including humans, they are commonly
used as FIB, or surrogates for pathogens, in water quality analyses
(see Use of Enterococci as Fecal Indicator Bacteria).
Several genotyping techniques have been employed with this
group to obtain correct identification to the species level and further discrimination at the subspecies level for clinical, environmental, and food-related issues, including ribotyping (232), repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR) or BOX-PCR
(16, 244), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (128, 326), 16S
rRNA gene sequencing (62, 244), and multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) (276). REP-PCR has been used to target repetitive genetic
sequences and, based on the genome size and the location of the
repetitive elements, to generate unique banding patterns (or
“fingerprints”) to differentiate strains. While one of the major
criticisms of this technique has been the lack of a consensus on
interpretations of the resulting fingerprints (216), horizontal,
fluorophore-enhanced REP-PCR (HFERP) improves alignments
between multiple gels and reduces within-gel groupings in the
resulting dendrograms (185). HFERP can identify isolates with
77% agreement with 16S rRNA genetic sequencing and superior
discrimination among environmental isolates (244).

The current standard in the clinical identification of Enterococcus spp. and strain typing is PFGE (163, 242). Whereas ribotyping
techniques accurately discriminate among species (140) and are
less expensive than PFGE, the latter method has better discrimination among closely related strains (128). MLST has proven to be
useful in epidemiological studies of E. faecalis and E. faecium (56,
91, 276), and studies have shown an accuracy equivalent to that of
PFGE for the identification of organisms to the subspecies level
(163, 242).
ECOLOGY
Responses to Environmental Stressors

When enterococci are released from the gastrointestinal tract of
warm-blooded animals into secondary habitats such as environmental waters, aquatic vegetation, or sediment, they are subjected
to a host of biotic and abiotic stressors that generally lead to a
decline in the population over time.
Sunlight. Sunlight has been a suspected stressor of bacteria
since at least 1877 (95). Major mechanisms of sunlight damage to
microorganisms include the direct absorption of UV light by DNA
or the indirect effect of the formation of endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species. The ability of DNA to absorb UV
light was discovered in 1929 (117), leading to studies of the mechanism of UV damage to DNA and microbial inactivation (33, 97,
189). Many mesocosm studies have noted the germicidal effect
(defined as a loss of culturability) of sunlight on enterococci (77,
112, 187, 255, 286, 306–308) (Table 2); however, the reported time
required to achieve a 90% reduction in the concentration (T90)
(equivalent to a 1-log reduction) varies widely according to geographic and seasonal factors and the experimental design (e.g., the
source of the inoculum or physicochemical properties of the water). For example, in marine and estuarine waters inoculated with
sewage, the reported T90 values range from 2 h (112) to 35 h (187).
Generally, mesocosm studies of saline waters conducted in
warmer climates (112, 306–308), during summer months (255,
306, 307), and in waters with relatively low turbidity (112, 187)
reported lower T90 values (more rapid die-off) than those reported for colder climates (187), winter months (255, 306–308),
and turbid waters (187). A similar trend was observed in freshwater mesocosm studies, where the reduction in levels of enterococci
was enhanced at higher temperatures (i.e., during summer
months and in warmer climates) (180, 255, 308). Mesocosm studies comparing sunlight inactivation in fresh versus marine waters

Byappanahalli et al.

(112, 255, 308) have generally found inactivation to be more pronounced in the latter.
While sunlight inactivation of microorganisms is a natural,
low-cost process for the treatment of contaminated water, its efficacy depends on numerous environmental factors, including the
chemical composition of the water (e.g., dissolved oxygen and
turbidity) and site characteristics (e.g., depth). The depth (77–79,
112, 180, 215) and turbidity (60, 78, 113, 187) of irradiated water
are inversely proportional to the effectiveness of sunlight disinfection. Both factors are positively correlated with the absorbance,
which is the difference between the amount of light energy (measured at a specific wavelength) that enters a sample and the
amount that passes through it (338). Once absorbed, UV light
loses its germicidal properties; thus, nonspecific absorption (by
substances other than the intended target) hinders the efficiency
of UV light disinfection. The sunlight-mediated inactivation of
FIB in waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) has been shown to increase with dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a wide variety of systems, including anaerobic, secondary facultative, and
maturation systems and algal ponds (64, 67, 70–72, 267). The
proposed mechanism for the observed synergistic action between
DO concentrations and sunlight inactivation postulates that endogenous chemicals (e.g., porphyrin derivatives, flavins, and
menaquinone) can act as “sensitizers” when they absorb light;
reactions between excited sensitizer molecules and oxygen lead to
the formation of reactive oxygen species (singlet oxygen, superoxide,
hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals), resulting in photooxidative damage to the organism (73, 80, 81).
Although mesocosm studies are helpful for isolating factors
that may contribute to the variability in the survival of enterococci, they cannot reflect all of the complex biotic and abiotic
interactions that occur in aquatic environments. Furthermore, the
use of single laboratory-grown strains (as opposed to wastewater
isolates) as a mesocosm inoculum may elevate inactivation rates
for enterococci (103), thus further compounding the issue. In
general, based on mesocosm studies, the time required to achieve
a decrease in the concentration of enterococci of 3 orders of magnitude (i.e., 99.9%) ranges from 0.9 to 52 h (76, 83, 103, 255, 308).
Sassoubre et al. (280) investigated field-relevant dark inactivation
and photoinactivation rates by sampling two sites in San Pedro
Creek, CA, hourly over 25 h. Between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. (time
points before and after sunlight exposure), concentrations of enterococci decreased by approximately 1 order of magnitude (280).
Comparable results were observed in a study in Hawaii, where 22
streams were sampled during the time before the sun rose (a.m.)
and at noon (p.m.); the concentrations of enterococci were approximately 0.5 logs lower in the afternoon (344). Boehm et al.
(30) conducted a 72-h experiment to investigate the diurnal variation in microorganism concentrations at Avalon Beach, CA, and
noted that concentrations of enterococci during the day were approximately 0.5 logs lower than those during the night (30). A
similar study conducted under dry weather conditions in a tidally
influenced salt marsh found a fairly wide range of concentrations
of enterococci (spanning up to 3 orders of magnitude), with the
early-morning concentrations generally being 1 to 2 orders of
magnitude higher than those in the late afternoon (94). Hourly
sampling in South Korea resulted in similar conclusions: under
dry weather conditions, sunlight inactivation of enterococci was
responsible for a reduction of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (59). A
recent study showed that exceedances of current regulatory stan-

688

mmbr.asm.org

dards for enterococci at marine beaches (i.e., 104 CFU/100 ml) are
more frequent during the night and late-afternoon hours (from
approximately 6 p.m. to 8 a.m.) than during the morning and
early afternoon, suggesting that sampling at different times of the
day can significantly influence beach management decisions
(100). Interestingly, a recent study described a possible mechanism for the extended survival of some enterococcal species exposed to sunlight: carotenoid pigment quenching of reactive oxygen species in certain strains appears to confer a competitive
advantage against sunlight-induced inactivation (over nonpigmented isolates) (217).
Salinity. The ability of enterococci to grow in the presence of
salt (6.5% NaCl) is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the
genus (see Enterococci and the Genus Enterococcus). The greater
salt tolerance of enterococci than of fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli probably contributes to their better performance as indicators of human health risk in marine recreational waters than
members of the coliform group (see Use of Enterococci as Fecal
Indicator Bacteria).
Many field (53, 94, 344) and mesocosm (10, 75, 187, 308) studies reported an inverse relationship between salinity and the detection/survival of enterococci (Table 2). A field study conducted
in tidally influenced Hawaiian streams (salinity range of 0.60‰ to
37.3‰) found a negative relationship between concentrations of
enterococci and physicochemical water parameters (temperature,
salinity, and dissolved oxygen content) (344). Similar findings
were reported for coastal Mississippi waters (salinity range of
0.00‰ to 26.4‰) and a salt marsh in California (salinity range of
29.4‰ to 30.5‰) (53, 94).
In a mesocosm study conducted in England using raw sewage
as a source of enterococci and ambient water of various salinities
(6.00‰ to 40.3‰), researchers observed an inverse relationship
between salinity and the time required to achieve a 90% reduction
in concentrations of enterococci (i.e., less time was required at
higher salinities) (187). In a New Zealand mesocosm study utilizing freshwater and marine waters inoculated with either raw sewage or an inoculum from a waste stabilization pond (WSP), enterococci persisted longer in freshwater than in marine waters;
interestingly, enterococci from raw sewage were more sensitive
than WSP enterococci to salinity (308). The decay of enterococci
in freshwater and marine subtropical environments seems to follow the same pattern. Anderson et al. (10) investigated the persistence of FIB from dog feces, wastewater, and soil known to be
contaminated with feces in mesocosms filled with either river or
Gulf of Mexico waters and sediments (10). Overall, decay rates of
enterococci in the marine mesocosms were at least 2-fold higher
than in the freshwater mesocosms, regardless of the location (i.e.,
water column or sediments) (10). Similar results were recorded in
a mesocosm study conducted in Australia, where researchers investigated the decay of indigenous sediment enterococci from
freshwater (salinity range of 1.6‰ to 3.3‰) and marine (salinity
range of 33.8‰ to 35.4‰) environments (75). Over a period of 60
days, concentrations of enterococci from marine sediments decreased by up to 2 orders of magnitude, while freshwater sediments maintained nearly intact concentrations for the duration of
the experiment (75) (see also “Environmental Reservoirs and Extraenteric Habitats”).
Conflicting results were reported in a field study conducted on
the River Seine and the Belgian coast of the North Sea, where the
differences in concentrations of enterococci between two different

Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews



Environmental Enterococci

water types were minimal (229). The authors of that study attributed the decrease in concentrations of enterococci to the actions of
predatory protozoa and stipulated that salinity may play a more
important role in culturability than in mortality rates, which were
assessed by the loss of [3H]thymidine-labeled strains (229).
Disinfection. Disinfection of wastewater is a barrier that is intended to prevent the contamination of receiving waters with FIB
and pathogens. The abilities of microorganisms to survive disinfection vary both with the organism and with the disinfection
method. Although fecal coliforms or total coliforms are generally
used to assess the efficacy of disinfection (152), some studies suggested that the survival of enterococci against disinfection is a
better predictor of the fate of viruses than are coliforms (84, 368).
Because ineffective wastewater treatment can allow enterococci
and pathogens to enter environmental waters, the responses of
enterococci to disinfection methods are discussed here.
The most common disinfection strategy in the United States is
the utilization of chlorine (or chlorine derivatives such as chloramines) followed by UV light irradiation. In a study examining the
efficacy of chlorine disinfection by adding various concentrations
of chlorine (11.8 mg/liter to 23.2 mg/liter in the form of sodium
hypochlorite) to filter-sterilized wastewater effluent from the primary treatment stage, concentrations of enterococci decreased by
more than 5 orders of magnitude after 15 min of contact time (25).
Similar results were reported almost 3 decades later, when comparable concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (8.0 to 30.0 mg/
liter) were added to wastewater effluent from the primary treatment stage seeded with pure cultures of selected organisms
(including E. faecalis) (328). In both instances, enterococci exhibited first-order decay: a rapid decrease of culturable enterococci
measuring approximately five orders of magnitude was observed
after 5 to 15 minutes of contact time, depending on the chlorine
concentration (328). Concurring results were reported in a more
realistic scenario, where concentrations of enterococci in wastewater influent and disinfected effluent were compared for six
wastewater reclamation facilities (five of which used chlorine disinfection) (152). Like fecal coliforms, enterococci were highly susceptible to disinfection, as both FIB were found in only 27% of
disinfected effluent samples; however, the decrease in the concentration of fecal coliforms through wastewater treatment was
higher than that of enterococci. A higher percentage of disinfected
effluent samples contained other types of indicator organisms,
including total coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, F-specific (F⫹)
coliphage, and somatic coliphage (152). While chlorine appears to
be an effective disinfectant against enterococci (Table 2) (and
other non-spore-forming bacteria), the potential for the formation of harmful by-products has led to the exploration of other
modes of disinfection, specifically UV light and ozonation.
A review detailing the effectiveness of UV disinfection against
enterococci (and other organisms) in wastewater and drinking
water systems was recently reported (162). The reported reductions in levels of enterococci are somewhat variable (spanning
approximately 2 to 5 orders of magnitude), depending on the
treatment processes prior to UV exposure (e.g., sedimentation or
coagulation) and the type and intensity of the UV source (155,
162, 174, 194, 301), with higher reductions observed with more
extensive downstream processes and stronger UV dosages. Comparisons of UV disinfection efficacies on a seeded laboratory strain
of E. faecalis versus environmental isolates indicated that the former is more resistant (57, 156, 222). Meta-analyses of the existing

December 2012 Volume 76 Number 4

literature indicated that chlorine disinfection considerably outperforms UV radiation in reducing concentrations of enterococci
by as much as 2 orders of magnitude (58, 152, 182, 272, 273)
(Table 2).
Starvation. The transition from the animal gastrointestinal
tract, a nutrient-rich environment, to oligotrophic environmental
waters exposes enterococci to nutrient starvation, one of the abiotic factors detrimental to their survival. One of the first reports
on the survival of enterococci under nutrient starvation conditions indicated that E. faecalis survived for extended periods in
sterilized sewage (presumably due to the availability of organic
nutrients) but declined rapidly in sterile lake water and phosphate
buffer, indicating that oligotrophic conditions (exemplified by the
sterile lake water and phosphate buffer) were deleterious to the
survival of enterococci (302).
Previous studies have identified at least 42 proteins in E. faecalis
that are induced under starvation conditions (e.g., glucose depletion or incubation under oligotrophic conditions) (122, 124, 146).
Furthermore, carbohydrate starvation can enhance resistance to
multiple stressors, including heat, oxidative stress, acid, ethanol,
and sodium hypochlorite (122, 124, 146, 199). One protein in
particular (gls24), belonging to the class A starvation proteins in E.
faecalis (synthesized in both growing and resting cells but differentially expressed during starvation) (123), was overexpressed under both starvation conditions mentioned above (122, 123). An
additional analysis of the protein (and the corresponding gls24
gene) revealed that the gene is under the control of a stress-inducible operon and that a mutation in gls24 has a pleiotropic effect on
cellular morphology (the formation of shorter chains of cocci),
stress sensitivity (reduced growth in the presence of bile salts), and
the expressions of several genes involved in pyruvate metabolism
(124).
Sigma factors are regulatory proteins that modify stress responses in bacteria by controlling the initiation of transcription
and are well characterized for E. coli (␴S) and Bacillus subtilis (␴B)
(158, 159, 161); however, their counterpart in the genome of Enterococcus spp. has not been fully described. Benachour et al. (24)
identified two genes (sigV and rsiV) in E. faecalis that are under the
control of the same operon and are predicted to encode sigma and
anti-sigma factors. Further analysis indicated the differential expression of the operon in response to exposure to various stresses;
notably, it was overexpressed under conditions of glucose starvation and complete starvation, suggesting that it plays an important
role in the response of enterococci to nutrient depletion (24).
Another E. faecium regulatory protein (␴54) was suggested to be a
potential virulence factor capable of influencing the rate of autolysis (and, by extension, the nature and composition of the biofilm
matrix [173]) and governing sensitivity to certain bacteriocins
(51, 74).
The viable-but-nonculturable (VBNC) phenomenon describes a state in which bacteria that can normally be cultured
under a defined set of conditions lose that ability while retaining
viability, as assessed by measurements of membrane potential,
infectivity, mRNA expression, the ability to reproduce, or cell envelope integrity (160, 188, 259, 341). A series of studies explored
the starvation-induced existence of the VBNC state in Enterococcus spp. (160, 210–212), in which viability assessments included
the presence of mRNA, cell envelope integrity, and the ability to
reproduce (assessed by Kogure direct viable counts). The authors
of those studies found marked differences in the time to the loss of

mmbr.asm.org 689



Byappanahalli et al.

culturability for various Enterococcus spp. and evidence supporting the existence of the VBNC state for E. faecalis and E. hirae. It is
particularly important to improve our understanding of the existence and nature of the VBNC state in enterococci, because VBNC
cells would be recognized by molecular methods, such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), but not counted by culture methods, which
could well contribute to the large differences in quantities estimated by conventional and emerging methods (318, 341).
Predation. Grazing by bacterivorous protozoa, bacteriophage
infection followed by virus-mediated lysis, and predation by some
bacteria are among the biotic effects that control the abundance of
prokaryotic organisms in the environment. Predation by bacteria
has been well described for Vibrio spp., most notably Vibrio parahaemolyticus, where infection by predatory Bdellovibrio spp. plays
a role in the population dynamics of these species (230, 319).
Bacteriophage infection affects a much wider range of bacteria,
and viral infection was suggested to be a mechanism responsible
for the elimination of up to 50% of autochthonous bacteria from
aquatic habitats (109, 266, 327). Bacteriophages that infect various
Enterococcus spp. (“enterophage”) from different sources (i.e., raw
sewage, cow manure, and environmental waters) were recently
described (31, 223, 268, 279). However, the effect of enterophage
on bacterial survival was not tested directly, since the main objective of these works was to examine the utility of enterophage as a
microbial source tracking marker. Nonetheless, the relatively high
concentrations of enterophage that specifically infects E. casseliflavus, E. mundtii, or E. gallinarum from cow fecal slurry (104 to 105
PFU/100 ml) and E. faecalis or E. faecium (⬃103 PFU/100 ml)
from raw sewage (268) indicate that, at least in these instances,
lysis by enterophage can be a predatory factor on populations of
enterococci.
Protozoan grazing is an important top-down control of bacterial populations in aquatic environments (e.g., see references 18,
75, 125, 224, and 229), including allochthonous bacteria such as
enterococci (20, 263, 289). Some estimates suggest that protozoan
grazing is responsible for up to 90% of the overall mortality of
both autochthonous and allochthonous microorganisms from
freshwater and marine environments (8, 229). Factors that affect
predation rates include temperature and characteristics of prey
populations. Digestion rates of both flagellated and ciliated protozoa increased exponentially at temperatures between 12°C and
22°C (294), and a direct correlation between rates of predation
and temperature was found in a variety of environments, with
more vigorous grazing and an increase in protozoan concentrations at higher temperatures (7, 9, 19, 225, 294). Prey characteristics such as cell wall morphology and the physiological state may
also influence the magnitude and efficiency of protozoan grazing
(23, 127, 220, 300, 343). Notably, lower rates of grazing were observed for Gram-positive organisms (including E. faecalis) than
for E. coli (75, 126, 169, 170, 253). Nonetheless, several experiments conducted in mesocosms and environmental chambers
documented decreases in concentrations of enterococci in marine
(29, 75, 146, 229) and freshwater (75, 229, 317) environments in
the presence of protozoa (Table 2).
The apparent predilection of protozoa for Gram-negative organisms may be explained by the physiological state of the enterococci and the preferences of different types of protozoa for particular prey. Hartke et al. (147) showed a more active grazing of
zooflagellate protozoa on E. faecalis cells harvested from the exponential growth phase than on glucose-starved cells, while nanofla-

690

mmbr.asm.org

gellates did not appear to exhibit a preference (147). Similarly, it
was shown that while E. faecalis concentrations decreased by more
than an order of magnitude over 72 h in coculture with Acanthamoeba polyphaga, amoeba levels were ⬃80% lower than those of the
negative controls that were grown in the absence of enterococci
(166). That same study found increases in amoeba numbers when
cocultured with E. coli, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhimurium, indicating that enterococci are not a good
food source for A. polyphaga (166).
Environmental Reservoirs and Extraenteric Habitats

In contrast to the initial conception of Enterococcus spp. as inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, we are gaining an understanding of the extent to which environmental habitats can serve as
sources and sinks of this group. Although the environmental
stressors discussed above negatively impact the survival of enterococci, many studies have clearly demonstrated the persistent nature of some Enterococcus spp. and strains in extraenteric habitats.
Figure 1 illustrates our current understanding of the major
sources and sinks of enterococci in environmental habitats. The
concepts presented in this graphical illustration are discussed in
Use of Enterococci as Fecal Indicator Bacteria. Table 3 provides an
overview of studies and findings on the occurrence, persistence,
growth, and population genetics of enterococci in extraenteric
habitats.
Aquatic and terrestrial vegetation. Cladophora, a macrophytic
green alga, is found in both fresh and marine waters. Until recently, the impact of Cladophora on beach water quality was unexamined, but in a seminal work, Whitman et al. (358) showed
that the algal mats collected along shorelines of southern and
northern Lake Michigan in the Great Lakes were a significant
source of FIB (E. coli and enterococci), with densities often exceeding 100,000 CFU/g (dry weight). These findings have been
confirmed by a number of studies of Lake Michigan and elsewhere
(342). Aside from FIB, enteric pathogens, such as Shiga toxinproducing E. coli (STEC), Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, have also been isolated from these mats, indicating that Cladophora may serve as an environmental source of these pathogens
in recreational water (41). Enterococci survived in sun-dried algal
mats stored at 4°C for over 6 months and displayed the ability to
grow to high concentrations (⬃108 CFU/g) upon rehydration
(358).
The high densities of FIB, including enterococci, in fresh Cladophora mats have been attributed to in situ growth (42). For
instance, enterococci grew over 100-fold in undiluted algal leachate at 35°C in 24 h, suggesting that Cladophora provides enough
nutrients to sustain these bacteria, which are known to have fastidious growth requirements, as evident by the commercial media
used for these bacteria (6). Cladophora is perennial in nature, and
in temperate waters (e.g., Great Lakes), it overwinters, leaving
behind scattered basal stumps; however, there have been no reports of residual enterococci or other FIB surviving in these
stumps under wintery conditions.
Other aquatic macrophytes that have been identified as sources
of enterococci include decaying seaweed (11, 131, 167). In New
Zealand, Anderson et al. (11) observed that the densities of enterococci in drifting seaweed exceeded those in seawater by 2 to 4
orders of magnitude; Grant et al. (131) found densities of enterococci as high as a 450,000 most probable number (MPN)/100 g in
a marsh in southern California. In addition to seaweed, recent

enterococci can transition from a reservoir to the water column and vice versa (green arrows). Fluxes act as secondary sources or sinks depending upon the
conditions.

studies have expanded the occurrence of enterococci to submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (mostly Hydrilla verticillata)
(15, 16). In laboratory studies, Badgley et al. (15) found that enterococci survived longer and at much higher densities in mesocosms containing SAV than in those without SAV. Furthermore,
the recovery of a dominant E. casseliflavus strain indicated that this
genotype was likely adapted to or naturalized on this vegetation.
Aside from macrophytic plants, enterococci have also been associated with planktonic communities and macroinvertebrates
(221, 299). Data reported by Signoretto et al. (299) suggested that
attachment and the shift to a VBNC state contribute to the prolonged survival of enterococci in marine waters. Furthermore, the
time of survival of enterococci is longer in sediments than in water
(see “Sediments” below) and in the presence of aquatic vegetation
(14, 358).
Some of the earliest findings for the association of enterococci
with terrestrial vegetation were demonstrated by Mundt (236),
who recovered these bacteria from flowers and buds of different
plant species. Recent studies have expanded these findings to forage and crop species (235, 261). Mundt (237) initially suggested
that the occurrence of enterococci in plants was seasonal, with
maximum recovery in late summer (September), and that these
bacteria were transient populations most likely introduced by insects and wind (237). Shortly thereafter, Mundt et al. demonstrated the ability of E. faecalis to grow on plants (238), and many
other studies have argued for the existence of epiphytic enterococci (204, 235, 261). Furthermore, the finding that certain strains
of Enterococcus spp. may have environmental adaptations, for instance, E. casseliflavus in submerged aquatic vegetation (15) and E.
casseliflavus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, E. mundtii, E. sulfureus, and many other strains resembling E. faecalis from forage
crops (50, 235, 261), strongly supports the existence of plant-associated enterococci.

Beach sand. The sanitary quality of beach sand, i.e., the extent
of contamination by FIB, has been a subject of public health concern in recent years (reviewed in reference 142). Numerous investigations across marine and freshwater beaches have repeatedly
shown that enterococci and other FIB and pathogens (e.g., E. coli,
Salmonella, and Campylobacter) are common microbial contaminants in beach sand, with potential implications for shoreline
water quality (120, 278, 290, 355, 363). Whether enterococci are
part of the natural resident or transient microflora of beach sand
remains unknown; different Enterococcus spp. have been recovered in sand from freshwater and marine beaches, e.g., E. faecium,
E. casseliflavus, E. durans, and many unidentified species from
Lake Michigan (44), and E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, E. casseliflavus, and E. mundtii from marine sediments (16, 102). However, the recent demonstration of biofilm-associated enterococci
in beach sands (265) argues that some of these populations are
resident.
In recent years, efforts have been directed toward an understanding of the sources and contributions of FIB and their potential interactions in the “beachshed” ecosystem, which comprises
the various sources of FIB, and their influences, within the beach
and its related watershed, as described by Whitman et al. (356)
(Fig. 1). Shoreline birds, particularly geese and gulls, have received
significant attention because of their abundance and potential influence on water quality (105, 136, 240). Other potential contributors may include beach visitors themselves as carriers of sandborne bacteria during recreational activities (99, 262); an
individual bather might contribute as many as 6.0 ⫻ 105 CFU of
enterococci through sand particles adhered to the skin (99). Hydrological processes, such as overflows, runoff, and wave surges
(27, 136, 271), are among the contributors to diffuse nonpoint
sources of enterococci that influence water quality at recreational
beaches. A growing body of data suggests that in situ bacterial

Environmental Enterococci

growth may be an alternative explanation for high levels of enterococci in beach sand (148, 367). Studies conducted in sand-filled
columns found that transient growth of enterococci occurred after intermittent wetting of sand (367). At the same time, the replication of enterococci under natural conditions is likely to be
limited because of desiccation and other environmental stresses.
Despite these limitations, the widespread occurrence of enterococci and other FIB in beach sand (44, 120, 355, 363) can be attributed to repeated seeding from birds and other sources (105,
240) as well as residual surviving populations, especially in moist,
subsurface sand in both foreshore and backshore areas (44).
Previous studies have shown that the densities of enterococci
in sand vary within and between locations (44, 264, 366). Densities
of enterococci as high as 7,200 CFU/100 g were reported in a study
conducted in coastal California (366). Lower densities of enterococci in beach sand have been reported in other studies; e.g., densities in samples of wet sand at Avalon Beach, CA, averaged a 310
MPN/100 g (ranging from nondetected to a 4,200 MPN/100 g)
(143). Likewise, in a 13-month study at two Great Lakes beaches
along southern Lake Michigan, Dunbar, and West Beach, the densities of enterococci (log MPN ⫾ standard error [SE]) in moist
subsurface sand near the water table averaged 1.1 (⫾0.15) and 1.1
(⫾0.08) MPN/100 g (44). Such variations in densities of enterococci probably reflect contaminant sources, the locations of sampling (e.g., foreshore and backshore areas) (44), and, importantly,
methods of sample collection and analysis (28). Currently, there is
no established or approved method(s) for FIB analysis in beach
sand/sediment substrates, and a patchy distribution of these bacteria in sand environments is highly probable, as observed for
other substrates (e.g., soil) (36, 40).
Despite concerted efforts, the management of beach sanitary
quality has proven difficult. Various management strategies, such
as sand replacement (355), beach grooming (190, 191), and bird
harassment using trained dogs, have been attempted, with various
degrees of success. The total eradication of FIB and other microbial contaminants might be difficult or simply impractical. For
instance, enterococci can survive and persist in moist subsurface
sand (44), countering the effects of surface treatments. Other
beach management practices, such as beach grooming—a tool
routinely applied for esthetic purposes—might help reduce the
problem but can be counterproductive when the particulate-associated FIB get dispersed and are deposited deeper, further protecting them and prolonging their survival in sand environments
(191). In these situations, the sand can serve as a continuous
source or reservoir of FIB and associated pathogens to nearshore
waters.
Sediments. Numerous studies have shown that both freshwater
and marine sediments are significant sources or reservoirs of enterococci (116, 119, 258, 296), with (sediment) bacterial densities
being typically several orders of magnitude higher than those in
the overlying water on a per-mass basis (10, 72, 102, 129, 252).
High bacterial densities in sediments have been attributed to better resistance to environmental stressors, in particular predation,
solar inactivation, starvation, possible regrowth, vegetation, and
related factors (10, 141, 167, 179) (see also “Responses to Environmental Stressors”). The prolonged survival of enterococci has
similarly been observed in freshwater (10, 15, 141) and estuarine
(10, 179) sediments.
Whether enterococci can grow under most environmental
conditions remains speculative; however, Mundt et al. (238) dem-

December 2012 Volume 76 Number 4

onstrated the growth of E. faecalis on germinating seeds and
plants. High bacterial densities in sediments (85, 102, 205), in
aquatic vegetation (15, 42, 358), and in detritus and planktonic
communities (234) suggest that enterococci grow in these nonenteric habitats under certain conditions. Growth of enterococci has
been observed in several mesocosm studies: in beach sand (367),
algal washings (42), rehydrated algal (Cladophora) mats (358),
and aquatic vegetation (15). These findings collectively support
their growth capabilities in the environment; however, more studies are needed to better understand this ecological process.
Because of their close interaction with surface water, sediments
play a major role in influencing shoreline water quality through
the resuspension of the particle-bound bacteria in the water column. While the quantification of bacterial loads from sediments
by conventional methods might be difficult, alternative techniques such as hydrodynamic or empirical modeling have increasingly been used in recent years to better understand this process
(118, 130). In large bodies of water, such as the upper Chesapeake
Bay, more than 80% of indicator organisms, including fecal streptococci and fecal coliforms, were found to be associated with suspended sediments (282). Such processes are often mediated by
mechanical disturbances during recreational activities (7), hydrometeorological events (including high-flow, wind, and erosional
conditions [116, 175, 274, 312] and river outfalls [98, 249]), as well
as dredging operations (134, 135). Collectively, such events can
increase FIB densities in the water even in the absence of any
significant human inputs.
Soil. Some of the earliest research on the survival of enterococci
in soils was conducted with experimental plots by van Donsel et al.
(340), who observed that the rates of survival of Streptococcus
faecalis were higher than those of fecal coliforms during spring
and winter, and while there was no difference in the survival patterns in the autumn, fecal coliforms survived longer than S. faecalis during summer months. Interestingly, many of the early investigations of the survival and persistence of enterococci/fecal
streptococci in soil environments focused on watersheds impacted by anthropogenic activities, particularly cattle grazing and
field lot operations (92, 165, 176). Recent studies confirmed that
populations of FIB (E. coli and enterococci) are equally abundant
in relatively less-impacted soils (46, 85, 110, 200). For instance, a
survey of soils on the island of Oahu, HI, showed that enterococci
were nearly ubiquitous compared to E. coli (98% and 54% frequencies in surveyed soils, respectively), with enterococcal counts
often exceeding a 1,000 MPN/g soil (40).
High densities of enterococci in soils may be attributed, in part,
to the greater survival abilities of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g.,
enterococci and staphylococci) than of Gram-negative bacteria
(e.g., E. coli, Pseudomonas spp., and Rhizobium spp.) in the face of
environmental stresses, particularly cellular injury and desiccation (17, 245). In one mesocosm study, densities of seeded E.
faecalis remained nearly constant (⬃6.0 log CFU/g dry soil) for 8
days when the moist soil (35% moisture, corresponding to a 60%
water-holding capacity) was allowed to desiccate (12% moisture)
under laboratory conditions (25°C). E. coli densities, on the other
hand, declined drastically from 6.0 log CFU/g to ⬍1 CFU/g in 4
days but returned to the original levels upon rehydration (37).
Similarly, enterococci survive longer than other enteric bacteria
under certain field conditions: in cow feces, a 90% inactivation of
enterococci occurred after 56 days, followed by E. coli (48 days),

mmbr.asm.org 693



Byappanahalli et al.

Salmonella enterica (38 days), nonenterococcal fecal streptococci
(35 days), and Campylobacter jejuni (6.2 days) (305).
It has been argued that soil environments provide the necessary niche for populations of FIB to survive, adapt, and grow in
these heterothermic habitats (115, 171, 361). While the growth
requirements of E. coli are relatively simple because of its ability to
synthesize cellular macromolecules from glucose and minerals
(12), enterococci require complex nutrients (e.g., growth factors),
even when grown under laboratory conditions on commercial
media such as m-Enterococcus agar and mEI (6). Although enterococci are relatively common in some tropical soils (40, 110,
145), studies of growth characteristics in these environments are
rather limited. In one study, enterococci grew only marginally in
the presence of full competition from the native microbiota; however, in the presence of nutrients (peptone) and reduced competition (achieved by the addition of sodium azide), enterococci
grew more than 100,000-fold over 13 days (38).
The paucity of available nutrients may thus limit the growth of
FIB in soil environments, yet a likely habitat that provides conditions for spurts of growth is the plant rhizosphere region, where
microbial activity is known to be severalfold higher than in the
adjacent bulk soil (310). The various compounds released by plant
roots as exudates into the surrounding soil are highly diverse and
complex, including amino acids, growth-promoting and growthinhibiting substances, low-molecular-weight sugars, organic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins (139, 310, 349). Additional
studies are needed to better understand pathogen and FIB ecology
in the rhizosphere.
Populations of enterococci represent only a small part of the
soil microflora. For instance, in six soil samples collected on the
campus of the University of Hawaii, culturable heterotrophic bacteria were about 10,000- to 10,000,000-fold more numerous than
enterococci (37). Furthermore, the widespread range of these bacteria in soils throughout the island of Oahu (40), comprised of at
least six different species of Enterococcus (40, 111), strongly supports the hypothesis of environmentally adapted or autochthonous populations in soil environments.
While the original source of populations of enterococci in soil
is debatable in some cases, potential sources include human and
animal (including wildlife) waste (Table 1 and Fig. 1), and over
time, a subset of the original population may have adapted to the
soil environment. In summary, aquatic and terrestrial vegetation,
beach sand, freshwater and marine water sediments, and soil have
been identified as some of the major environmental sources of
enterococci and other FIB. FIB derived from these sources can
potentially impact the water quality of associated beaches and watersheds, and thus, there is a need for a better understanding of
their fate in these ecosystems.
USE OF ENTEROCOCCI AS FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA

For over a century, FIB have been used to assess water quality and
protect humans from the myriad of enteric pathogens that are
transmitted by the waterborne route by acting as fecal indicators
(reviewed in references 277 and 362). FIB are generally commensal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tracts of many warmblooded animals and are shed in feces at high densities; thus, they
are easily detected in contaminated waters. Ostrolenk et al. (260)
were among the first to suggest that the enterococci might be more
appropriate FIB than E. coli (260), and studies conducted in the
1970s confirmed this suggestion for marine waters (49, 96). More

recently, multiple studies have shown a correlation between elevated concentrations of enterococci and the risks of humans contracting gastroenteritis during recreational water use, particularly
when point source contamination is present (186, 267, 333, 335).
The use of enterococci as FIB has been criticized almost since
their adoption as a regulatory tool (64), because the epidemiology
studies on which the standards were based were focused solely on
waters contaminated by point source (particularly human sewage) pollution (47, 333). Little was known about the relationship
of enterococci and other FIB to human health in recreational waters contaminated by nonpoint sources when the regulations were
promulgated (115). Recently, some studies found an association
between densities of enterococci and illness rates at beaches impacted by nonpoint sources of contamination (104, 304). While
there was an increased incidence of gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness, and skin illness in bathers in one study (104), the
only health effect with a dose-response relationship to concentrations of indicator bacteria in both studies was skin illnesses (104,
304). Furthermore, in a comparison of analytical methods, the
dose-response relationship for skin illness was seen only with samples analyzed by membrane filtration (304). Enterococci are currently the only FIB recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for brackish and marine waters, since they
correlate better with human health outcomes than other FIB, such
as fecal coliforms or Escherichia coli (346–348). Several epidemiological studies have also shown a correlation between concentrations of enterococci in beach sands and gastrointestinal illness in
bathers (31, 157).
Characteristics associated with “ideal” FIB include a lack of
virulence; the existence of a simple, rapid methodology for enumeration; survival characteristics that are similar to those of
pathogens in extraenteric environments; and a strong association
with the presence of pathogens (49). In contrast to this ideal, studies have shown that populations of enterococci may be endogenous in sediments and soils and not exclusively of fecal origin,
which may confound accurate water quality assessments (37, 85).
Furthermore, many domestic and wild animals can contribute
enterococci to water bodies (Table 1), which complicates the FIBpathogen relationship since the suite of pathogens associated with
various animal gastrointestinal tracts and the risk associated with
fecal contamination are highly variable (309, 364). Figure 1 depicts some of the many possible sources (blue arrows) of enterococci in environmental waters, which include human sources,
such as sewage and its many derived products, e.g., biosolids, and
fecal shedding from recreational water users. Other important
sources are agricultural contributions, which may come directly
from animals, e.g., cattle or swine defecating in and near water
bodies, or indirectly from activities such as the spreading of manure or poultry litter on fields (334). Wildlife (e.g., birds, deer,
feral hogs, and raccoons) (Table 1) can be sources of enterococci
in urban and rural environments, either via direct deposition
(represented by the gull depicted mid-lake in Fig. 1) or in runoff.
The particulate matter in storm water contributes to the transport
of enterococci in receiving waters and eventual deposition into
sediments (90). Enterococci may also attach to aquatic vegetation
and detritus (14–16, 234). When sediment is disturbed by high
flow, waves, or the activity of humans or animals, enterococci can
recontaminate the water column in what can be considered a flux
(Fig. 1, green arrows). Here, we define a flux as a transport pathway for enterococci that begins with the primary source (e.g., fe-

Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews



Environmental Enterococci

ces), followed by deposition to a sink, in which enterococci are
temporarily sequestered (e.g., sediments). In the case of a flux, the
sink is temporary and eventually becomes a secondary source
when organisms reenter the water column following a disturbance
(183, 207). Likewise, fluxes of enterococci from aquatic vegetation
to the water column or runoff from a field to a stream can constitute a secondary source. Permanent sinks, in which enterococci
are deposited into an area from which they have very little probability of being transported to water, are less common (Fig. 1,
yellow arrow); appropriate examples would be properly functioning on-site wastewater disposal systems such as septic systems and
pit toilets.
Several studies have reported difficulty in finding media that
can effectively enumerate the broad range of Enterococcus spp.
without sacrificing specificity to the genus (204, 288), and the
identification of isolates of enterococci from environmental matrices (e.g., plants, soil, sediments, sand, and water) remains challenging (14, 43, 89, 151, 235). Upon the initial introduction into
an extraenteric environment, enterococci may become rapidly inactivated (see also “Responses to Environmental Stressors”),
which could potentially result in false-negative results when enterococci are used as pathogen surrogates (226, 281). Conversely,
the underlying sediments and aquatic vegetation can act as reservoirs for enterococci (see also “Environmental Reservoirs and Extraenteric Habitats”) (14–16, 85, 205), which may lead to overestimates of health risks when pathogens are not similarly persistent.
Several methods for the detection and enumeration of enterococci have been successfully used and are prescribed by regulatory
agencies to predict health risks. The epidemiological studies conducted in the 1970s that were used to set recreational water quality
criteria (48, 49) concentrated enterococci by membrane filtration
and cultured them on mEI medium; consequently, membrane
filtration methods are the current “gold standard” for water quality assessments (336). In addition to standard methods using
membrane filtration, numerous monitoring laboratories have
also relied on alternative culturing techniques. A comparison of
membrane filtration with multiple-tube fermentation and chromogenic substrate methods, i.e., Enterolert (34), showed that results did not vary significantly by method (132) and were being
used interchangeably to manage beaches across a large portion of
Southern California. With the increasing frequency and number
of beaches being monitored for enterococci since the passage of
the BEACH Act (22), many locations are using either chromogenic substrate or membrane filtration analytical techniques, with
results being used interchangeably across jurisdictions for beach
management (246).
The benefits of both culture-based methodologies discussed
above are that the techniques are easily learned and the methods
are not costly (254). Furthermore, concentrations of enterococci
obtained by using culture-dependent methods have shown significant correlations with human health risks in estuarine and marine waters (47, 333). Despite the demonstrated advantages, the
drawback of these culture-based methods is that they have a
lengthy time lag (18 to 24 h) before results are obtained (201). This
lag results in the postponement of decisions on risk management
for recreational water use, potentially exposing humans to health
threats between the sample collection time and the reporting of
results, as FIB concentrations can vary widely across small spatial
and temporal scales (32, 201, 250, 254, 354). In other words, by the
time the testing results are reported, the contamination that

December 2012 Volume 76 Number 4

caused the elevated FIB concentrations may have dissipated, leaving the water body safe for use by the time a warning is eventually
posted.
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR DETERMINING
CONTAMINATION SOURCES, ASSESSING WATER QUALITY,
AND DETERMINING HUMAN HEALTH RISKS
Microbial Source Tracking

While the presence of enterococci in the feces of a wide range of
animals is a useful characteristic for a general indicator of fecal
contamination, no information on the contamination source is
provided by the quantification of the group as a whole. Knowledge
of fecal contamination sources is useful or required in many scenarios, e.g., for total maximum daily load (TMDL) assessment,
risk assessment for water use, and remediation of polluted water
bodies (137, 153, 337). Microbial source tracking (MST) methods,
which target host-specific microorganisms as identifiers of fecal or
sewage sources in water bodies, have repeatedly addressed the lack
of specificity of conventional FIB (recently reviewed in references
137, 153, and 275).
The enterococci have been the focus of the development of several MST methodologies (reviewed in reference 315). Library-dependent methods require a large database of FIB from the feces of
host species; FIB are isolated from feces and genotyped or phenotyped (149) to identify specific characteristics or traits for discrimination among strains. Once the accuracy of the library categorization of isolates by host source is ascertained, isolates from water
or other matrices are then compared to library isolates for assignment to source categories. Although field studies that used enterococci as source identifiers for library-dependent MST methods
initially indicated promise for use in a regulatory context (138,
154, 359), the expense, difficulty in the interpretation of results,
and uncertain accuracy of such methods (315) have discouraged
their general use. The potential for the extended persistence and
possible growth of enterococci in extraenteric habitats (Fig. 1)
further complicates the interpretation of results from library-dependent MST methods. Instead, the focus of MST has turned to
library-independent methods, which generally rely on PCR to
identify gene fragments (markers) specific for microorganisms
that are host associated (153).
The esp gene of E. faecium (espfm) is strongly human associated
(5, 287, 357), although a low frequency of cross-reactivity with
nonhuman feces has been noted, and it is not readily detected in
some sewage sources, such as on-site (septic) systems (4, 357). The
occurrence of espfm was correlated with human polyomaviruses in
polluted surface waters in Florida (227) and with fecal coliforms in
another study (197). It has also been used in field studies in Florida, the Great Lakes, and Australia (5, 39, 196, 209). A quantitative
PCR (qPCR) method for espfm has been developed and used in
field studies in Australia (4). Interestingly, the presence of the esp
gene was found to affect the transport of E. faecium in saturated
quartz sands by lowering bacterial mobility through increased attachment to sand particles (184).
A novel approach for identifying MST markers of enterococci
associated with various hosts was proposed by Soule et al. (311),
who used DNA microarrays to identify candidate host-specific
Enterococcus species and associated genes. The use of bacteriophages specific to certain strains of Enterococcus spp. was also recently explored (32, 268) (see also “Responses to Environmental

mmbr.asm.org 695



Byappanahalli et al.

Stressors”). Many other MST methods rely on microbial groups
other than enterococci (recently reviewed in references 275 and
365), including anaerobes such as the Bacteroidales (e.g., see references 26, 291, and 292) and Methanobrevibacter smithii (331)
and viruses (106, 227, 228). The correlation of MST marker detection or concentrations with concentrations of enterococci has
varied across studies: Harwood et al. (150) found no correlation
between concentrations of enterococci and levels of human sewage markers in untreated sewage; however, enterococci and the
human Lachno2 marker were strongly correlated in a freshwater
harbor that received combined sewer overflows (251). As is the
case for currently recognized FIB such as enterococci, the usefulness of MST for water quality assessment is ultimately predicated
on the correlation of human health risk and pathogen presence
with host-specific markers; however, there are many data gaps
remaining in this growing area of research.
Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment

The term quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) refers
to a risk analysis framework and process for defining the type(s) of
microbial hazard that is likely to be encountered in a given situation and the magnitude of the probable harm (risk), usually to
some human population (177). Over the past decade, QMRA has
increasingly been applied to hazard estimations for recreational
water quality, and enterococci are frequently employed in these
models (13, 329). Schoen et al. (285) found that measurements of
levels of enterococci by culture methods are likely to underestimate the risk of gastroenteritis caused by enteric viruses in recreational waters where contamination is from mixed sources; in
contrast, qPCR estimates of densities of enterococci were more
reliable predictors of norovirus and human health risk. QMRA
has been used to estimate the relative risk from contamination by
human sewage versus animal sources in models that use the U.S.
EPA’s recreational water quality criterion for enterococci (35
CFU/100 ml) as one reference point (284, 309). Among the
sources examined, gull fecal contamination carried the least human health risk, and cattle contamination carried the greatest
(309). Another study estimated that rain events and storm water
runoff increase health risks to surfers (329). QMRA has been recommended as an important component of a “holistic” approach
to recreational water quality assessment (13), which includes extensive knowledge of the watershed(s), including potential pathogen sources and transport pathways. An important caveat in all
risk assessment models that use FIB as surrogates is that the ratio
of FIB to pathogens is highly variable in contaminating fecal material and in water samples (13); therefore, users must be cognizant of the limitations of such models.
Rapid Testing Methods

While epidemiological studies conducted at sewage-impacted
beaches continue to support the association between concentrations of enterococci and rates of swimming-related illnesses (345,
346), the time lapse between sample collection and the availability
of results severely compromises their usefulness in making appropriate decisions regarding the opening or closing of beaches. Efforts to overcome these shortcomings have included the use of
rapid enumeration methods such as qPCR (155), alternative indicators that are more specific to the contaminant sources (e.g.,
human-associated Bacteroides, Catellicoccus gull fecal markers,
and Brevibacterium poultry fecal markers) (26, 213, 351, 352),

696

mmbr.asm.org

direct monitoring for potential pathogens and QMRA (see above)
(13), and predictive modeling (164, 249), but cost, ease of use, and
sustainability as a monitoring program must all be considered in
optimizing the application of any newer method or monitoring
technology. More information on the sensitivities and specificities
of individual tests are provided in other sections.
Alternate methods for the enumeration of enterococci in surface waters that do not rely on bacterial growth and therefore are
more rapid and have the potential to become “real-time” tools for
water quality assessment have been developed in recent years.
Among these methods, qPCR (e.g., see reference 155) has been the
most widely tested method and is currently under consideration
for application in beach programs. While membrane filtration
relies on the detection of living and culturable enterococci, qPCR
quantifies DNA from both living and dead cells, a difference with
potential implications for regulatory and management decisions.
Some studies identified a correlation between the two endpoints
in side-by-side comparisons with culture-dependent methods
(45, 201, 298). Direct comparisons of the results of the two tests
have been discouraged due to differences in variation along a concentration gradient and fluctuations in outcomes due to the original source of the enterococci (201, 353). Inhibition during qPCR
analysis has been a significant issue, and efforts to refine the technique have led to numerous modifications of the original protocol, including purification kits, additional filtration steps, and
smaller sample volumes (256). The lack of universal standards,
calibrators, and methods complicates the use of this test as a monitoring standard. Recent method validation studies have begun to
address these concerns (93, 201, 350).
Another emerging technology that has been widely tested is
immunomagnetic separation-ATP (IMS-ATP) (206). In this analysis, target enterococci or other FIB are concentrated and separated through the use of specific, antibody-coated immunomagnetic beads; the cells are then quantified by measuring the
bioluminescence response from the bacterium’s ATP (206). Unlike qPCR, IMS-ATP targets only metabolically active cells; however, the use of ATP as the target can result in the detection of
organisms that may not be culturable by using standard culture
methods (35). Because IMS-ATP depends on active cellular metabolism, it may underestimate target concentrations compared
to methods that measure total cells, such as qPCR. In a comparison study of numerous test methods, IMS-ATP analysis and culturable enterococci showed a strong correlation between the two
results, with the exception of one location (35). Further comparisons indicated that IMS-ATP suffered from a large number of
false-positive results (133). The cost of the equipment and analytical reagents and the need for technical expertise/personnel may
limit its application for routine monitoring.
Further analytical approaches have sought to target multiple
potential indicators and pathogens simultaneously by using molecular techniques. For example, the Luminex (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) detection system has been developed to test
multiple targets through the detection of DNA, RNA, or proteins;
this technique has been used to analyze FIB (e.g., E. coli and Enterococcus spp.) and pathogenic bacteria such as Shigella spp. in a
multiplex format (21). In brief, the extracted DNA is marked with
probes, and a detection system determines the overall concentration of the target microbes. Experiments using natural waters
found that the methodology worked best on river water samples.
The targets were not as concentrated in beach water and sand;

Environmental Enterococci

therefore, group-specific primers were developed to optimize the
technique for these natural waters (21). Initial results indicated
that the system could detect Enterococcus spp., but quantities were
often quite different from those obtained by culture methods (21).
Further method validation indicated that the Luminex system had
the highest specificity and sensitivity for Enterococcus over those of
IMS-ATP or any of the currently used DNA-based methods, such
as PCR and qPCR, with no false-positive results for the negative
controls (133). That study cautioned that the system has yet to be
fully developed for use with natural water samples; as with many
molecular methods, natural water samples introduce inhibition
and other obstacles to accurate detection (313).
Aside from comparisons among analytical methods, the issue of
primary importance is the usefulness of a given method for predicting health risk. Thus, any new application with a weak or no
clear relationship between the measured parameter and human
health would be less useful for the management of recreational
water quality. Overall, qPCR results for enterococci have generally
correlated well with illness rates at sites impacted by point sources
(345, 346, 348). However, if the contaminants are from nonpoint
sources (e.g., storm water), evidence for effects on health is thus
far conflicting; i.e., several studies did not find a correlation between qPCR for enterococci and health effects (2, 64, 104, 304),
but one did (63).
Predictive Modeling of Levels of FIB

In addition to advancing molecular technologies to develop rapid
tests for enterococci, efforts have been made to improve reporting
accuracy by predicting concentrations of enterococci in situ by
using statistical models. Predictive models have also been encouraged by the U.S. EPA (332), and as such, they have been used in
numerous locations in the United States. Unlike many of the rapid
analytical tests developed, predictive models are not hindered by
interference from other materials suspended in natural beach water. Typically, beach monitoring data for FIB are collected in concert with data for hydrometeorological variables, such as wave
height, solar insolation, and wind direction, and the combination
of parameters that best predicts the concentration of enterococci
is determined through statistical modeling (246). Statistical models have included regression (246, 298), Bayesian analysis (69),
and neural networks (219); the complexity of the type of model
that is tested is determined by need and application: more simple
models can be used for daily predictions, while complex models
integrate numerous parameters and may be used for determining
contamination sources and pathways in order to develop mitigation plans. Simple models, such as rainfall threshold, allow for
immediate management decisions (314), while more complex
models, incorporating multiple predictive variables, require additional technology and expertise (246). Predictive models have met
with uneven success; the source of contamination and characteristics of the beach structure generally influence the predictability
of concentrations of FIB (247, 298). Common predictors can be
linked directly to the physical persistence of enterococci in water:
solar insolation affects bacterial die-off, wave height influences the
resuspension of settled particle-attached bacteria, and wind direction influences the advection of bacterium-containing plumes
from point sources such as rivers and streams (246). Predictive
models can be developed which provide results in a fraction of the
time currently required for FIB culturing techniques and even
rapid molecular methods. Public health improvements with the

December 2012 Volume 76 Number 4

use of a predictive model have not been adequately assessed, but
one study indicated an improvement in overall health protection
with the use of a model over standard, culture-dependent techniques (248).
CONCLUSIONS

Major advances in the understanding of the phylogeny of the enterococci and the ecology of the group in secondary habitats have
been made over the past several decades. While these advances aid
in the protection of human, animal, and environmental health,
many gaps remain. From our perspective, among the most important areas for further research is the gaining of a better understanding of the relationship between environmental enterococci
and a range of human pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter, Salmonella,
enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio spp., and Listeria monocytogenes)
commonly transmitted through contaminated water and food
networks. Additional epidemiological studies of waters impacted
by nonpoint source pollution that include the identification of
enterococci to the species level and the quantification of pathogens are also needed to better understand the human health risks
associated with elevated levels of FIB. Measurements of nutrient
levels (e.g., total organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and micronutrients) in conjunction with survival studies that are realistic
simulations of aquatic environments will provide a further understanding of the drivers of the fate of enterococci in extraintestinal
habitats. The possible ecological roles of enterococci in extraintestinal habitats, e.g., the decomposition of organic matter, competition with other members of the microbial community, and the
protection of plants from pathogens, warrant further investigation. When used in conjunction with the quantification and species-level identification of enterococci, next-generation sequencing technologies may well revolutionize our understanding of the
ecology of these organisms and their continued usefulness as FIB
for recreational waters worldwide. A coordinated, international
effort that focuses on the issues outlined above and that involves
academic and regulatory research scientists could produce a comprehensive data set that allows us to define the impact of ecological
factors on the survival of enterococci and the relationships among
enterococci, pathogens, and human health in environmental settings.

Center in Porter, IN, where she has worked for
the past 15 years. Her research interests include
microbiological contamination of beaches, improving public health protection through beach
monitoring, impact assessments on biological
communities, and aquatic ecology. Ms. Nevers
has published extensively on beach health and
improving monitoring accuracy through predictive modeling as well as in the ecology and
natural occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria and is frequently invited to
present her research at national and international professional meetings. She
is the team leader for predictive modeling in her research group. Ms. Nevers
serves on the board of the Great Lakes Beach Association and is an active
member of the American Society for Microbiology and the International
Water Association.

Zachery R. Staley is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida in Tampa. He has published two peer-reviewed manuscripts focusing
on the impact of agrochemicals on the fate and
survival of fecal indicator bacteria. He has also
participated in studies utilizing microbial
source tracking (MST) to determine and remediate sources of fecal contamination in local water bodies.

Valerie J. Harwood, Ph.D., is a Professor in the
Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida in Tampa. She has published over 55 peer-reviewed manuscripts on
subjects ranging from the biochemistry of hyperthermophiles and the ecology of Vibrio spp.
to the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in
aquatic habitats and their relationship to pathogens. She was among the first to investigate the
potential of microbial source tracking (MST) to
determine animal and human contributions to
fecal pollution in water bodies and is coeditor of the 2011 book Microbial
Source Tracking: Methods, Applications, and Case Studies. She is a member of
the Editorial Board of Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

Asja Korajkic, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in
the National Exposure Research Laboratory at
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She
received her doctoral degree in Environmental
and Ecological Microbiology at the University
of South Florida in Tampa under the guidance
of Dr. Valerie J. Harwood. Her research has
been published in several peer-reviewed journals and presented at numerous international
conferences. Her current research is focused on
the fate and transport of fecal indicator bacteria,
microbial source tracking (MST) markers, and pathogens in aquatic
habitats.
