Acute infectious diarrhea is common in children. Control requires knowledge of causes. Few comprehensive
long-term studies of etiology have been undertaken in developed countries. This report is of a 13-year survey
of 4,637 children from 0 to 14 years of age, admitted to a large children’s hospital for treatment of gastroenteritis, in which viruses, bacteria, and parasites were sought. A recognized enteric pathogen was identiﬁed in
56.6% of children. Group A rotaviruses occurred in 39.6% of children overall and in 55% of children 12 to 23
months of age. They were a frequent cause (18.7%) of acute gastroenteritis in children under 6 months and in
those aged 5 to 13 years (16%). Rotaviruses were almost entirely responsible for winter admission peaks.
Enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 (6% overall) were more frequent in children under 12 months (9.4%).
Salmonella spp. (5.8%) and Campylobacter jejuni (3.4%) were more common in children over 5 years (13.1% and
6.7%, respectively). The 43.5% of cases (60% in children under 6 months) where no enteric pathogen was
identiﬁed are cause for concern. The involvement of small viruses (including caliciviruses and astroviruses)
may be clariﬁed when molecular biology techniques are utilized to address this gap in our knowledge. This
comprehensive 13-year study of the cause of acute infectious diarrhea in children in developed countries
reinforces the importance of rotavirus and highlights a large group for whom the etiology remains unknown,
an issue of particular concern with babies under 6 months of age. New techniques have the potential to identify
old and new pathogens causing disease in these vulnerable infants.
There are relatively few comprehensive studies of the viral,
bacterial, and parasitic etiology of severe acute diarrhea in
children admitted to hospital in developed countries (7, 12, 30,
31) and only one long-term study (extending over 6 years)
describing annual changes in the occurrence of pathogens (11).
We have conducted a survey of etiological agents in the stools
of children aged 0 to 14 years with acute diarrhea who were
admitted to the infectious-disease ward of one hospital (Royal
Children’s Hospital [RCH], Melbourne, Australia) between
April 1980 and March 1993. The results document the relative
importance of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens (identiﬁed predominantly by available routine diagnostic techniques)
in causation of severe acute diarrhea in Melbourne children
during a period of 13 consecutive years.

Acute infectious diarrhea is a common disease in young
children throughout the world. Estimated incidence rates in
developing countries range from 3.5 to 7.0 episodes per child
per year during the ﬁrst 2 years of life and from 2 to 5 episodes
per child per year for the ﬁrst 5 years (4). Attack rates in
children less than 5 years old in developed countries range
from 1.0 to 2.5 episodes of diarrhea per child per year, with 0.1
to 0.4 episodes resulting in attendance at a general-practice
clinic and 0.001 to 0.003 episodes resulting in hospitalization
(13–15, 18, 21, 27). It has been estimated that there are more
than 20 million cases of diarrhea annually among children less
than 5 years old in the United States, resulting in approximately 2.5 million physician visits, 220,000 hospitalizations,
and up to 40 deaths.
Pediatric diarrhea is a costly disease in terms of direct (and
indirect) monetary costs to each community, and it is a cause
of emotional trauma for the child and the parents. The costs of
treating rotavirus infection alone have been estimated to be in
excess of £6.3 million annually in the United Kingdom (25) and
$352 million in the United States (24). Control of pediatric
diarrheal disease would lead to considerable health-care cost
savings in all countries (8). Effective control of diarrheal disease in any community depends upon an accurate understanding of the relative importance of etiological agents, particularly
in relation to the disease burden in various age groups. It is
likely that the most cost-effective control measures will be
those aimed at causes of disease at the severe end of the
spectrum, i.e., disease requiring admission to hospital.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and geographical setting. The study population included 4,637 patients, comprising all infants and children (0 to 14 years old) admitted directly to
the gastroenteritis ward of the RCH, Melbourne, from April 1980 through
March 1993 with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis (deﬁned as diarrhea and/or
vomiting of 4 days’ duration or less, where no alternative cause was identiﬁed).
The RCH, Melbourne, is a large tertiary pediatric center serving the state of
Victoria, Australia. This state has a population of approximately 4 million and
had a stable annual birth rate of 60,000 to 70,000 during the period of the survey.
The climate is temperate, with seasons showing average minimum and maximum
temperature ranges of 13.7 to 25.2°C in summer (December through February)
and 6.3 to 14.0°C in winter (June through August). The RCH receives 20 to 25%
of statewide pediatric admissions for gastroenteritis. Families are representative
of all socioeconomic levels. Approximately 5,000 patients present to the hospital
each year for treatment of acute gastroenteritis, many parents regarding the
hospital as a primary-care facility. More than 90% of these patients are treated
as outpatients. Those admitted are the subjects of this report.
Specimen collection. Samples of feces from 3,785 of the total number of 4,637
patients (81.7%) were obtained within 48 h of admission to the hospital. Feces
samples were obtained from ⱖ80% of children 0 to 23 months, 74 to 78% of
children 24 to 35 months, and 56 to 69% of children ⱖ36 months old (see Table
1). The most common reason for failure to collect a fecal specimen was discharge
within 24 h of admission. Fecal specimens were divided into three aliquots and
were transported the same day to hospital laboratories of the departments of

1992). The number of children with rotavirus diarrhea is shown.

Bacteriology, Gastroenterology, and Virology, where they were stored at 4°C
until processing. Specimens for bacteriological and virological culture were inoculated into appropriate media on the day of collection. Specimens for examination for viruses, by methods such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and negative-stain electron microscopy (EM), were prepared as 10% homogenates in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0, and were clariﬁed by low-speed centrifugation at 2,000 ⫻ g for 10 min. PBS extracts were stored at 4°C for 1 to 2
weeks until they were tested. Surplus PBS extracts and unextracted feces were
stored at ⫺70°C until further tests were required.
Bacteriology. Specimens were examined for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.,
Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas by using xylose-lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD), deoxycholate-citrate agar (DCA), and selenite F enrichment broth, incubated in air at 35°C for 18 to 24 h. DCA was incubated at room
temperature for an additional 24 h to enhance recovery of Y. enterocolitica.
Selenite F broth was subcultured onto XLD incubated in air at 35°C for 18 to
24 h. Isolates were identiﬁed by using standard biochemical and serological
techniques. Isolates of Salmonella were serotyped and phage typed by the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit at the University of Melbourne. All specimens
were cultured for Campylobacter jejuni. Initially this was performed by using
Skirrows medium incubated at 42°C in an atmosphere of 7% CO2 and 85% N2.
From 1988, the membrane ﬁltration technique was used with horse blood agar
incubated at 35°C for 48 h in 7% CO2 and 85% N2 (28). Enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC) strains were isolated on MacConkey agar and identiﬁed by using polyvalent antisera. This practice was discontinued in 1985.
Microscopy. All specimens were examined microscopically for the presence of
leukocytes, erythrocytes, and parasites (amoebae, cysts, or ova) by using a salineand-iodine wet preparation. Modiﬁed acid-fast smears for the detection of cryptosporidia were performed for all specimens during the warmer months of the
year (November through April) from 1984 onward (29).
Virology. All specimens were examined by EM to detect viruses shed in feces
(rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and small viruses). The method incorporated the
concentration of a clariﬁed fecal homogenate (10%) with polyacrylamide before
negative staining with 10% ammonium molybdate (pH 7.0). Samples were also
tested for adenoviruses and rotaviruses by EIA. Specimens that were found to be
rotavirus positive by EM but negative by EIA were examined by gel electrophoresis of extracted double-stranded RNA to identify electropherotypes resembling group B or C rotaviruses. Organisms in adenovirus-positive specimens were
typed by EIA with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MA5-8 and MA5-15, speciﬁc
for adenovirus types 40 and 41, respectively. These adenovirus-speciﬁc MAbs
were kindly donated by J. C. de Jong of Rijkinstituut Voor Volkesgezondheid en
Milieuhygiene, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.
Specimens obtained during 1981 through 1983 were inoculated onto human
diploid ﬁbroblast, primary cynomologus monkey kidney, and HeLa cell monolayer cultures. Primary isolates were subpassaged into fresh cultures and identiﬁed with appropriate speciﬁc antisera.

Prevalence of enteric pathogens. Our analysis excludes those
children from whom no specimen was available. Table 1 shows
the total results for the 13-year period, listing pathogens isolated in relation to patient age group. Results are displayed
graphically in terms of percentages of the various pathogens in
children of each age group (Fig. 3). A recognized enteric
pathogen was identiﬁed for 2,138 of 3,785 children (56.5%)
from whom a specimen was obtained. Pathogens classiﬁed as
“other” enteric pathogens in Table 1 included Shigella spp.
(n ⫽ 11); Y. enterocolitica (n ⫽ 8); EPEC, including O44, O55,
O86, O111, O127, and O128 (n ⫽ 12); cryptosporidia (n ⫽ 18);
Giardia lamblia (n ⫽ 12); and Aeromonas hydrophila (n ⫽ 1).
No attempt to identify phenotypic correlates of the EPEC
strains identiﬁed was made.
Group A rotaviruses were the single most common pathogen. The overall prevalence of rotavirus infection among children admitted who provided a fecal specimen was 39.6%, ranging from an annual minimum of 20.2% in 1983 (when a
prolonged drought appeared to have disrupted the usual seasonal pattern of rotavirus occurrence) to a maximum of 55.7%
in 1991 (Fig. 4). Rotaviruses were predominant in children of
the 6- to 35-month age group (49% of patients in this age
range). Peak incidence occurred in the 12- to 23-month age
group, where 55% of patients exhibited group A rotavirus
infection. Rotaviruses also occurred in a smaller but signiﬁcant
percentage of very young infants, being identiﬁed in 133 of 711
(18.7%) infants less than 6 months of age. They were identiﬁed
as the sole etiological agent in older children aged 5 to 13 years
(median, 7 years) in 45 of 282 patients (16%). Serotype G1
rotaviruses predominated throughout the 13 years, with epidemics of serotype G2 and G4 and sporadic occurrence of G3
strains. These results have been presented in detail elsewhere
(3).
Two non-group A rotaviruses (belonging to group C) were
identiﬁed during the survey.
Enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 were present in 228 of
the total number of 3,785 (6%) patients. They were noticeably
more common in younger children, occurring in 9.4% (132 of
1,398) of children under 12 months of age, compared with
5.0% (64 of 1,283) of children aged 12 to 24 months and only
2.9% (32 of 1,104) of children aged ⬎2 years (P ⬍ 0.001, X22).
Small viruses (approximately 30 nm) lacking identiﬁable
morphology were seen by EM in 13 of 3,785 (0.3%) specimens.
None were cultivable in the cell lines available. Recent examination of these specimens by using molecular biological tech-

Admissions. The total number of children admitted during
the 13 years of the survey was 4,637 (58% male), ranging from
a minimum annual total of 258 in 1990 to a maximum of 458 in
1984 (mean, 362; standard deviation, 54). Figure 1 shows the
total number of admissions each year and the number associated with rotavirus infection. The overall monthly distribution
of the number of children admitted during the 13-year period
ranged from a minimum of 251 in January to a maximum of
602 in August (Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the age distribution. The
majority of children (67%) were aged ⬍24 months, and of
those children, 17.3% (800 children) were ⬍6 months old. A
total of 413 children (8.9%) were ⬎5 years old.

niques has allowed identiﬁcation of the majority of these small
viruses as astroviruses (26).
Cultivable viruses were identiﬁed in diarrheal feces obtained
from 117 of 827 (14.1%) children during the period 1981 to
1983. Viruses isolated included adenoviruses (n ⫽ 42) of types
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 31; echoviruses (n ⫽ 41) of types 6, 9, 11, 14,
15, 22, and 30; coxsackieviruses (n ⫽ 12) of types A4, A9, B2,
B3, and B5; poliovirus vaccine strains (n ⫽ 21); and reovirus
(n ⫽ 1). During the period when EM and cell culture were
performed in parallel, only 10 of 42 (24%) adenoviruses adaptable to cell culture were visualized by EM. None of the other
cultivable viruses were seen by EM. Cultivable viruses were
present as mixed infections with enteric pathogens in 33 of 117
(28.2%) children, organisms identiﬁed including rotaviruses
(n ⫽ 17), enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41, (n ⫽ 6), Salmonella
spp. (n ⫽ 5), Shigella spp. (n ⫽ 2), C. jejuni (n ⫽ 1), and G.
lamblia (n ⫽ 2).
Salmonella spp. were isolated from 220 of 3,785 (5.8%) patients and caused a higher proportion of diarrhea (13%) in

older children, those aged from 5 to 14 years (median 8 years),
than in young children ⬍5 years old (5.2%). Salmonella typhimurium was the most common species identiﬁed.
C. jejuni strains were isolated from 129 of 3,785 (3.4%)
patients and were more common (6.7%) in children aged 5 to
14 years (median, 9 years) than in younger children (3.1%).
Methods of culture for C. jejuni were not optimal early in the
study. However, there was no obvious change in its occurrence
after 1988, when new isolation techniques were introduced.
Shigella spp. were uncommon and were identiﬁed in only 11
(0.3%) children.
Parasites, including G. lamblia and Cryptosporidia, were
identiﬁed in 12 (0.3%) and 18 (0.5%) children, respectively.
Mixtures of two or more pathogens were identiﬁed in 62 of
3,785 (1.6%) children. These mixtures included rotaviruses
with Salmonella spp. (n ⫽ 18), C. jejuni (n ⫽ 14), enteric
adenoviruses (n ⫽ 9), or Shigella spp. (n ⫽ 5) and enteric
adenoviruses with Salmonella spp. (n ⫽ 10), C. jejuni (n ⫽ 2),
G. lamblia (n ⫽ 2), Shigella spp. (n ⫽ 1), or Cryptosporidia

(n ⫽ 1). Ages of children with mixed infections ranged from
1 month to 7.6 years, the median age being 25 months.
No acknowledged enteric pathogens (NPI) were identiﬁed
in 43.5% of patients. This situation was more frequent in infants under 6 months of age (58.5%) and children of 5 years or
more (60%) than in children aged 6 to 49 months (34.2%).
Seasonal occurrence of enteric pathogens. Overall hospital
admissions for acute diarrhea showed a seasonal pattern (Fig.
2), with the number of patients admitted in the cooler months
of the year (May to September) being approximately double
the number of those admitted during the warmer months (October to April). The seasonal patterns for all gastroenteritis
admissions reﬂected the patterns of admissions recorded for
rotavirus infections (Fig. 2). Rotaviruses were detected in children admitted to the hospital in 135 of the 156 months studied.
The numbers ﬂuctuated monthly (Fig. 2 and 4), with the annual peak prevalence occurring in colder months (May to September) in 12 of the 13 years. There was no winter peak of
rotavirus infection in 1983; this coincided with a severe, prolonged drought. The rotavirus season began late in July 1983,
peaked in December, and continued through the southernhemisphere summer of 1983 to 1984, merging with the 1984
winter peak. Rotaviruses were not detected for 1 to 3 months
during most summers.
Unlike the situation for rotaviruses, no consistent seasonal
patterns of occurrence of enteric adenovirus infection were
observed, and clusters of adenovirus infections occurred in any
month. There was no evidence of seasonal patterns of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections (Fig. 5). No seasonal peri-

odicity was observed for gastroenteritis for which no cause
could be assigned (NPI).
DISCUSSION
This survey conﬁrms worldwide studies implicating group A
rotaviruses as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea in young children (0 to 3 years) admitted to hospitals in
developed and developing countries (2, 14, 27). Over the 13
years of this study, a recognized enteric pathogen was identiﬁed in 56.5% of patients; these pathogens included group A
rotaviruses (39.6%), enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 (6%),
Salmonella spp. (5.8%), and C. jejuni (3.4%).
Our results show remarkable agreement with the results of
an 8-year U.S. survey of viral etiology, in which 34.5% of
children admitted to hospital with severe diarrhea excreted
rotaviruses (5). The burden of rotavirus disease was greatest in
young children aged less than 5 years. Nevertheless, rotaviruses
were identiﬁed as the sole etiologic agent of severe acute
diarrhea in 16% of children over 5 years of age, including
children aged 10 years or more, none of whom had preexisting
disease likely to predispose them to or exacerbate symptoms of
enteric infection. Clinical symptoms in these older children on
presentation to hospital were severe enough to require admission for treatment. This implies that age does not necessarily
result in physiological resistance to disease in humans, contrary
to observations for experimental animals, where clinically apparent diarrhea is rare after the ﬁrst few weeks of life (1).
During the 13 years of this survey, rotaviruses were identiﬁed

by postmortem analysis of intestinal contents as the cause of
death for two patients who were dead on arrival at the hospital
(unpublished data).
Non-group A rotaviruses were identiﬁed to be present in
only two children during the period of this survey, emphasizing
the rarity of their involvement in etiology of severe acute diarrhea in children. This conﬁrms more recent studies of children in the United States which used molecular biological
techniques of diagnosis (19). Although cultivable viruses, including enteroviruses, were identiﬁed in 14.1% of patients, it is
unlikely that many of these were etiologically related to diarrhea. Most were excreted in small numbers, below the level of
detectability by EM (⬍106 particles/ml), and 30% were present
as mixed infections with known enteric pathogens. While no
control group of children was examined during this survey, the
range of cultivable viruses identiﬁed resembles that of viruses
previously cultured from healthy infants examined during a
controlled study conducted in the United States in 1970 (32).
Over the 13 years of this study, patterns of diarrhea-related
admissions ﬂuctuated from month to month and year to year.
Winter epidemics of rotavirus infection usually extended over
a range of 3 to 6 months. The number of admissions in any one
winter was not directly related to the presence of more than
one rotavirus serotype (3). Episodes unrelated to rotavirus,
which included those associated with other pathogens, together with NPI episodes, were remarkably consistent in occurrence from year to year and throughout the seasons. The
periodicity of gastroenteritis admissions appears to have been
caused primarily by the periodicity of rotavirus-associated episodes, conﬁrming a survey of hospitalized children in the
United States, based on interpretation of national hospital
discharge data records (20). The seasonality of rotavirus epidemics remains unexplained. An interesting phenomenon associated with a prolonged drought that began during the spring
(September to November) of 1982 and extended throughout
the summer and autumn of 1983 occurred in this study. Rotaviruses were seldom identiﬁed in children admitted to the
hospital during a 9-month period (October 1982 to June 1983).
Following their reappearance in July 1983, the epidemic carried on through the unusually wet summer (December to February) of 1983 to 84 and merged with the 1984 winter epidemic.
This appears to have been a “catch-up” phenomenon, with
rotaviruses infecting a larger-than-usual population of susceptible infants.
The importance of enteric adenoviruses belonging to serotypes 40 and 41 in the etiology of severe acute diarrhea in
young children is conﬁrmed in this study, in which 6% of
diarrhea episodes were caused by this virus (6, 9). Most adenovirus infections occurred in children ⬍24 months of age.
Our fecal cell culture results conﬁrmed that the majority of
adenoviruses visualized in stool specimens by EM represent
noncultivable enteric serotypes 40 and 41 (6, 17). No consistent
seasonal pattern of occurrence of enteric adenovirus infection
was observed, and peaks of adenovirus identiﬁcation appeared
to be random.
Small viruses were occasionally detected in 0.3% of patients
by EM, and all were later identiﬁed as astroviruses (26). The
prevalence of astroviruses was underestimated in this EM survey. A year-long survey conducted during 1995 using an astrovirus-speciﬁc cDNA probe (26) identiﬁed astrovirus infection
in 3 to 4% of children admitted to hospital with severe diarrhea. Recently developed tests to detect human caliciviruses
were not incorporated in this survey (10, 16, 23). The development of molecular biological techniques to detect astroviruses and caliciviruses, once applied to similar surveys, may

identify these viruses as common etiological agents of diarrhea
in young children.
The overall results show Salmonella and Campylobacter to be
the major bacterial pathogens in the community studied. Parasitic and mixed infections are rare. The low prevalence of bacterial and parasitic pathogens compared with rates observed in
similar surveys in developing countries has been recorded in
many similar surveys in developed countries (2).
The large percentage of cases (43.5%) where no recognized
pathogen was identiﬁed raises a number of issues. Firstly, techniques for identifying known pathogens may not have been
optimal during the course of this study. Many different organisms may cause diarrhea, and it is not possible in a clinical
survey such as this to screen specimens for the entire range of
potential enteropathogens. For example, techniques to detect
diarrheagenic E. coli were not routinely included. However,
previous surveys indicate that these enteric pathogens are rare
in children in developed countries (2, 22). In addition, Clostridium difﬁcile can cause severe diarrhea in children but was
sought only when requested by clinicians. Secondly, even when
speciﬁcally sought, some pathogens may not be detected
because of excretion in insufﬁcient numbers. In particular,
intermittent excretion or collection of feces only during the
recovery phase may result in failure to isolate the causative
pathogen. The inability to identify a pathogen in many infants
⬍6 months of age (60%) may have been inﬂuenced by passively acquired maternal antibody that could rapidly reduce
microbial shedding to undetectable levels. Thirdly, and of most
importance, there may be other (some as yet unknown) pathogens causing severe diarrhea in young children for which diagnostic tests were not available during the course of this
study. Our results imply that these elusive pathogens could be
of particular importance in diarrhea affecting infants less than
6 months of age.
The results of this study emphasize the importance of viral
infections in causation of severe diarrhea in children. They give
strong support for resistance to routine prescription of antibiotics. Measures to control childhood diarrheal diseases in Australia and other developed countries should be directed at
prevention of infection with Salmonella spp. C. jejuni, and
enteric adenoviruses and at development of an effective rotavirus vaccine.
