Removal of human pathogens from wastewater is a critical factor with linkage to human health. Constructed
Wetlands (CWs) are environmental friendly ecosystems that are applicable not only for chemical pollution control, but also for the reduction of pathogens from wastewater. Yet the knowledge on the fate and removal of such
indicator bacteria in CWs is still not sufﬁcient due to the complexity of removal mechanisms and inﬂuencing factors. This review serves to provide a better understanding of this state-of-the-art technology, which is necessary
for further investigations and design development. The fecal indicator bacteria in CWs mainly come from three
sources, namely, inﬂuent wastewaters, regrowth within the CWs, and animal activities. The properties of microbial contamination vary depending on the different sources. The removal of pathogens is a complex process that
is inﬂuenced by operational parameters such as hydraulic regime and retention time, vegetation, seasonal ﬂuctuation, and water composition. The most frequent and well-validated removal mechanisms include natural
die-off due to starvation or predation, sedimentation and ﬁltration, and adsorption. The concentration of the

main fecal indicator bacteria in the efﬂuent was found to be exponentially related to the loading rate. Generally,
horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs have better reduction capacity than free water surface ﬂow CWs, and hybrid
wetland systems were found to be the most efﬁcient due to a longer retention time. Further improvement of
fecal indicator bacteria removal in CWs is needed, however, levels in CW efﬂuents are still higher than most of
the regulation standards for reuse.

1. Introduction
Water overexploitation and pollution as consequences of human
population growth and economic development have caused a marked
decrease of per capita water availability (WHO, 2006). Concomitantly
with the rising demand for clean water, large amounts of wastewater
are being generated. Even though various wastewater treatment technologies including centralized and decentralized systems have been developed, the overall treatment capacity is still relatively low in
developing countries due to the economic concerns. Moreover, the standard limits for efﬂuent quality control is mainly replying on organic
compounds (COD, BOD), nitrogen and phosphorus. The sanitation control of pathogens in the efﬂuent has not gain much attention so far.
However, human health should not be jeopardized by residual pathogens remaining in the water after treatment (Winward et al., 2008a).
Most efﬂuent wastewater in advanced treatment systems is
disinfected by using chemicals such as chlorine. However, this practice
can create further health related and ecological concerns due to the formation of disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes, which have
led to restrictions of chlorination for disinfecting wastewater (Toscano
et al., 2013). Moreover, alternative forms of wastewater treatment are
often needed, as centralized treatment is not always an economical option. This is especially the case in rural and remote regions in developing
countries. Therefore, attention has been shifted to testing the capacity
for human pathogen removal in eco-sustainable systems such as constructed wetlands (CWs), which are designed to reduce pollutants
without or with less addition of disinfection chemicals (Decamp and
Warren, 2000).
Research on CWs started essentially in the 1950s with the work of
Dr. Käthe Seidel in Germany (Vymazal, 2010). Since then most studies
on CWs have focused on the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants, but an increasing number of investigations has focused on the capacity of CWs to eliminate fecal indicator bacteria, i.e. surrogates for

human pathogens (e.g. Gersberg et al., 1989; Green et al., 1997; García
et al., 2008; Headley et al., 2013). Results from these studies suggest
physico-chemical and biological mechanisms and factors that may contribute to fecal indicator bacteria removal in CWs such as adsorption,
sedimentation, reactive oxygen species, starvation, and predation by
other microbial entities (García and Bécares, 1997; Ottová et al., 1997;
Boutilier et al., 2009). However, the complexity of abiotic and biotic relations in CWs has hampered a conceptual understanding of indicator
bacteria removal processes in these treatment systems. In addition,
the inherent variability between CW units even of the same type, e.g.
difference in root density, hydraulics, and water characteristics, has impeded the systematic description and prediction of the removal processes that occur within these environments (Werker et al., 2002;
Vymazal, 2005).
For reasons of analytical feasibility, wastewater quality is typically
assessed based on enumerations of fecal indicators such as generic
Escherichia coli rather than of speciﬁc human pathogens (Dufour et al.,
2003). In line with that approach, this review addresses the potential
pathogens and indicators in the various inﬂuents and within the wetlands but focuses almost exclusively on fecal indicator bacteria for the
discussion of removal mechanisms such as natural die-off, sedimentation & ﬁltration, adsorption and predation, and parameters inﬂuencing
removal including hydraulic regime and retention time, vegetation, seasonal ﬂuctuation (variability), water compositions, media and pH. The
performance of various types of CWs and systems integrated with
other advanced technologies are evaluated also based on the removal
of fecal indicators. Finally, perspectives and implications for future
work are provided.
2. Sources of pathogens and fecal indicators in CWs
There are about 60 known general types of waterborne human pathogens. These include viruses such as rotavirus, bacterial pathogens such

as Vibrio cholerae, protozoa such as Cryptosporidium parvum, and multicellular eukaryotic parasites such as the guinea worm, Dracunculus
medinensis. Any potential etiological agent in the efﬂuent of a CW may
stem from human or animal excreta and being capable to survive or
even grow (or re-production and proliferation) in the wetland for a
prolonged timeframe (Leclerc et al., 2002), may be a member of the autochthonous wetland community, e.g. the opportunistic pathogen
Aeromonas hydrophila (Hazen et al., 1978), or may be ubiquitous in nature, i.e. naturally present in water bodies and the human body such as
Klebsiella pneumoniae (Podschun et al., 2001) (Fig. 1).
It would be too cost-intensive to survey all potentially present pathogens in a CW and its inﬂuent and efﬂuent on a regular basis. Except
during diseases outbreaks, their abundance in wastewater is low or
even below detection levels; and the diversity of pathogens plus the
breadth of their environmental distribution patterns demand elaborate
detection methodologies. Furthermore, the targeted cultivation of
human pathogens, i.e. microbes of Biological Safety Level (BSL) ≥2, has
to occur in designated laboratories. Comprehensive surveys of seasonal,
out-break associated, and geographical occurrences of pathogens in
CWs are hence not available nor unlikely to be generated in the near future. Instead, microbial indicators for fecal contamination in the wastewater sources are quantiﬁed for analytical feasibility and convenience to
evaluate the pathogen removal performance of wastewater treatment
and sanitation processes (Payment and Locas, 2011). These indicators
typically include Escherichia coli (E. coli), total coliforms (TC) and fecal
coliforms (FC), more stress-resistant fecal streptococci (FS) (=fecal enterococci), sometimes staphylococci (ST), and Clostridium perfringens
(CLP), which spores are considered conservative surrogates for
C. parvum and Giardia lamblia (oo)cysts. Only few studies have measured etiological agents such as the enteric bacterium Salmonella
typhimurium and the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(Karim et al., 2004; Winward et al., 2008a), Listeria spp. (Karpiscak
et al., 2001), and Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. (Falabi
et al., 2002; Karim et al., 2004; Reinoso et al., 2008). Fig. 2 provides
quantitative information on fecal indicator concentration in the various
wastewater sources fed into CWs, i.e. domestic sewage, tertiary efﬂuents, municipal wastewater, dairy and leachate efﬂuents.
Some fecal indicator bacteria may grow within the bed of CWs. Rose
et al. (1991) reported regrowth of coliforms bacteria of 10- to 100-fold
the initial concentration in stored gray water after 48 h. Furthermore,
Dixon et al. (2000) observed that total coliforms concentration in stored
gray water increased by over 2 log10 units within 24 h. In contrast, studies on the enteric bacteria, Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. seeded
into gray water indicated that no regrowth occurs due to the rapid dieoff in the presence of competing microorganisms (Ottosson and
Stenström, 2003). Therefore, regrowth of pathogens in CWs might
occur, but the dynamics of such regrowth are complex and are highly
dependent on factors such as temperature, water composition and

Fig. 2. Indicator bacteria concentrations in various wastewaters fed into CWs (TC: total coliforms; FC: fecal coliforms; EC: Escherichia coli; FS: fecal streptococci; CLP: Clostridium
perfringens; ST: staphylococci). The data for the indicator bacteria in domestic sewage
was collected from Quiñónez-Díaz et al. (2001), Boutilier et al. (2010), Nokes et al.
(2003), Abdel-Shafy and El-Khateeb (2013), Reinoso et al. (2008), Richter and Weaver
(2003a), Ansola et al. (2003), García et al. (2008), García et al. (2013), Keffala and Ghrabi
(2005), Horn et al. (2014), Mbuligwe (2005), Galvão et al. (2009), Barros et al. (2008). The
data for the indicator bacteria in secondary and tertiary efﬂuents was collected from Ayaz
(2008), Kadlec et al. (2010), Toscano et al. (2013), Tuncsiper (2007)). The data for the indicator bacteria in municipal wastewaters was collected from Ansola et al. (2003), Solano
et al. (2004a). The data for the indicator bacteria in diary wastewaters was collected from
Travis et al. (2012), Mantovi et al. (2003).

solar intensity. Furthermore, the regrowth rate of various bacterial
pathogens in different types of CWs is still poorly understood and
should be further investigated.
Animal activity may also play a role in introducing pathogens (e.g.
some serotypes of E. coli and Salmonella) and fecal indicator bacteria

Fig. 1. Three main sources of fecal indicator bacteria in free water surface ﬂow CWs.



S. Wu et al. / Science of the Total Environment 541 (2016) 8–22

into CWs, particularly into free water surface ﬂow CWs (Fig. 1). For example, large bird populations could be attracted to CWs, which could affect concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. This is in agreement with
studies that reported passerine populations as the major source of E. coli
in some surface ﬂow wetlands (Orosz-Coghlan et al., 2006) and others
that showed bird feces as a signiﬁcant source of enterococci in coastal
wetlands (Grant et al., 2001). Thurston et al. (2001) conducted a comparative investigation using two horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs, one
fed with disinfected groundwater and the other fed with wastewater,
in order to evaluate the likely impact of local wildlife on the presence
of indicators and pathogens. No indicator bacteria, coliphage, or protozoan parasites were detected in the wetland's inﬂuent, chlorinated
groundwater. However, an average of 1.3 × 102 CFU TC and 22.3 CFU
FC per 100 mL were detected in the efﬂuent. Correlating total versus
FC in the two CWs indicated animal activity as a source of potential
fecal indicator bacteria. Graczyk et al. (2009a and 2009b) found that efﬂuents from a small-scale free water surface ﬂow constructed wetland,
used for polishing secondary treated wastewater, contained signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of potentially viable zoonotic enteropathogens,
including Giardia duodenalis cysts and Enterocytozoon bieneusi spores,
than wetland inﬂuent. Even though the reason for the increase in fecal
indicator bacteria in CWs cannot be excluded from the regrowth, the
effect contributed by bird, dog and livestock activities may also be signiﬁcant. However, to the authors' knowledge, the information on quantitative evaluation of these sources is rarely reported and should be
further investigated.
3. Fate of fecal indicators and removal mechanisms
Removal of fecal bacteria and pathogens in CWs may occur via physical, chemical, and biological factors, alone or in combination. Physical
factors consist of mechanical ﬁltration, sedimentation, and sorption to
organic matter and the CW's matrix. Chemical factors include oxidation
and exposure to biocides excreted by plants. Biological factors comprise
antimicrobial activity of root exudates (Axelrood et al., 1996), predation
by nematodes and protists (Decamp and Warren, 1998; Decamp et al.,
1999), activity of lytic bacteria or viruses (Axelrood et al., 1996), retention in bioﬁlms (Brix, 1997), natural die-off, and competition for
limiting nutrients (Green et al., 1997). The most signiﬁcant removal
mechanisms of fecal bacteria and pathogens in CWs might vary depending on the particular design type of the treatment unit, the hydraulic regime, wastewater characteristics, and even the local climate. This
section is devoted to discussing the most frequent and certain removal
mechanisms in CWs. It should be noted that the vast majority of studies
has targeted bacterial pathogens, largely due to greater quantiﬁcation
ease as compared to enumeration of viral and protozoan pathogens
and multicellular parasites. The various inﬂuencing factors on the bacteria removal mechanisms will be examined in the subsequent section.
3.1. Sedimentation and ﬁltration
Sedimentation has been reported to be effective in removing
some bacteria, such as helminth eggs, coliforms and fecal streptococci (Karathanasis et al., 2003; Vacca et al., 2005), due to their higher
settling velocities (e.g., ~ 0.1 mm/s) (Sengupta et al., 2011). However,
protozoan (oo)cysts and bacteria have much lower settling velocities
[e.g., b 0.001 mm/s for Giardia cysts (Dai and Boll, 2006)] and viruses
are stable in suspension. These pathogens can only be effectively removed by sedimentation if they are attached to larger particles, in
which case their elimination from the wastewater correlates with
particle removal (Jasper et al., 2013; Quiñónez-Díaz et al., 2001).
About 10–50% of E. coli were found to be associated with particles
N5 μm in wastewater (Boutilier et al., 2009), and are thus more amenable to sedimentation. Kansiime and van Bruggen (2001) assessed the
role of suspended material such as peat on the settling of FC in the
water column of Nakivubo wetland in Kampala, Uganda (Kansiime

11

and van Bruggen, 2001). Their results showed that addition of fresh
peat material from Cyperus papyrus mats to wetland water resulted in
a more rapid removal of FC, as compared to that wetland which
contained plain water. Likewise, organic detritus derived from plants
could contribute to the sedimentation of FC in suspension (Kansiime
and van Bruggen, 2001).
FC could also accumulate in the sediment of various aquatic systems
(Lijklema et al., 1987). According to Brettar and Höﬂe (1992), survival of
these coliforms might be prolonged due to the reduced grazing pressure
in the sediment, and even regrowth of coliforms might occur owing to
the availability of nutrients from settled particles.
Mechanical ﬁltration was reported to play an important role in reduction of pathogenic microorganisms (Karim et al., 2004), particularly
in subsurface ﬂow CWs. Redder et al. (2010) observed reduction rates of
approximately 2 log10 CFU/100 mL for the protozoan pathogens, C. oocysts and Giardia cysts, in a pilot and a ﬁeld scale subsurface ﬂow
CWs. Their results demonstrated that ﬁltering wastewater was the primary mechanism effectively removing the protozoans. The removal of
C. oocysts and Giardia cysts appeared to be independent of the types
of ﬁlter used, nevertheless, smaller particle-sized matrices seemed to
be more effective.
Sleytr et al. (2007) evaluated the effect of ﬁltration on fecal indicator
bacteria removal, and reported values of 0.5–8 (log10 CFU/g dry weight)
for coliforms (E. coli, TC) and enterococci at different depth layers of vertical ﬂow CWs. The removal of TC, FC, and FS was also examined in an
experimental vertical ﬂow CW (Arias et al., 2003). Results from that
study suggested that ﬁltration is a major removal mechanism for
these indicator bacteria in such treatment systems. Recycling of treated
efﬂuent to the sedimentation tank did not affect elimination of the indicator bacteria (Arias et al., 2003), even though it enhanced the removal
of total nitrogen.
3.2. Adsorption
Adsorption of bacteria in the bed of CWs when wastewater ﬂows
through is partially a mechanism of ﬁltration. This adsorption might
be due to both interactions with substrates and/or plant roots, while
the strength of this interaction depends on the respective adhesive
properties and the ionic composition of the medium. It has been
shown that a number of FC could be removed by their attachment to
plant root surfaces. Considering the possible saturation of substrates
and plant roots, however, a net removal of coliforms by adsorption
might happen only at the beginning of CWs operational periods and
would not be signiﬁcant in cases of long term operation (Solano et al.,
2004a). Nevertheless, long term equilibrium between adsorption capacity and other types of removal mechanisms such as die-off should not be
discarded.
The attachment capacity of FC to the roots of C. papyrus and
Miscanthidium violaceum was determined by Kansiime and van
Bruggen (2001) in the Nakivubo wetland in Kampala, Uganda. Their results showed a high number of FC detected on the root surfaces of
C. papyrus (18,000 ± 4000 MPN/g DW of root, DW = dry weight) compared to those of M. violaceum roots (220 ± 95 MPN/g DW) (Kansiime
and van Bruggen, 2001). This high number of coliforms attached to papyrus roots could be attributed to the high root density and large surface
area created by the well-developed secondary roots of C. papyrus.
3.3. Natural die-off
Natural die-off of indicator bacteria in CWs is a result of many inactivation processes and is inﬂuenced by various factors, such as predation
and starvation, and the exposure to physical or chemical stressors. Yet
the magnitude of natural die-off is difﬁcult to quantify. Boutilier et al.
(2009) investigated its relative importance in two free water surface
ﬂow CWs treating both domestic and agricultural wastewater. Natural
die-off of E. coli appeared to be the most signiﬁcant contributor to the



12

S. Wu et al. / Science of the Total Environment 541 (2016) 8–22

overall removal of indicator bacteria in the two types of wastewater examined in this study. However, more investigations on natural die-off
and its effect on indicator bacteria removal are necessary for more complete understanding of this subject matter.
Predation includes the bacteriovorous activity of nematodes, rotifers, protozoa, bacterivorous bacteria, and phages, and was cited by
Green et al. (1997) as an important factor in the removal of bacteria
and protozoan (oo)cysts from wastewaters in CWs, but much less is
known about viruses (Jasper et al., 2013). Bacteriovory of protozoa, especially ciliates, has been documented for a range of environments including wastewater treatment plants (Curds, 1982; Pernthaler, 2005).
Predation by nematodes was reported as a factor in the removal of FC
from wastewaters in macrophyte ponds, although quantitative measurement was not performed. One study showed that ciliates were
abundant in the CWs at Audlem, United Kingdom and in laboratory microcosms derived thereof, whereas nematodes and rotifers were rarely
encountered (Decamp and Warren, 1998).
The bacterivorous activity of ciliates isolated from CWs was investigated by measuring their grazing rates of ﬂuorescently labeled E. coli
(Decamp and Warren, 1998). The grazing rates for the ciliated protozoa
Paramecium were measured to be 111 E. coli/(ciliate-hour) and 170
C. parvum oocysts/(ciliate-hour) in lab experiments. Hence, a population of 2 × 104 Paramecium per liter would have the potential to achieve
greater than 6-log removal of E. coli or oocysts in 1 h, if these were the
only particles in the water. Grazing rates in an actual wetland are expected to be signiﬁcantly lower, because pathogens would represent a
small fraction of the total particles (Jasper et al., 2013) and some
E. coli cells may be attached to particles large enough to offer protection
from free-swimming protozoa (Davies and Bavor, 2000).
Removal of indicator microorganisms and pathogens by copepod
predation in a free water surface CW (total area of 76.7 ha and a treatment capability of 3.0 × 104 m3 day− 1) was demonstrated by Song
et al. (Song et al., 2008). At copepods concentrations of 3.0 × 102/L,
and 6.0 × 102/L, higher removal rates were observed for indicator and
pathogenic microorganisms as compared to a control group without
any copepod addition, suggesting that predation by copepods is an important mechanism for the removal of bacteria in CWs.
Predation by protozoa and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was also reported to play an important role in the removal processes in vertical
ﬂow CWs (Wand et al., 2007). Several factors are known to affect predation rates, which might be related to the prey (e.g. concentration, attached vs unattached), the predator (e.g. morphology, feeding
strategy) or physicochemical factors (temperature, Eh, hydrodynamics
of the microenvironment) (Decamp and Warren, 1998; Pernthaler,
2005).
While predation may provide an effective means for removing indicator organisms from water, the viability of the organisms after ingestion is uncertain in some cases. In general, protozoan grazing is a
major mechanism of bacterial population control (Hahn and Höﬂe,
2001). However, there is evidence that some pathogenic bacteria are
not inactivated as a result of ingestion by protozoan grazers, such as ciliates and amoebas (Steinberg and Levin, 2007). Indeed, pathogenic bacteria such as Legionella actually colonize free-living amoeba to protect
themselves from unfavorable environmental conditions (Thomas
et al., 2010). More research is needed on inactivation of the wide
range of pathogens of concern in wastewater by the different types of
grazers in CWs.

4. Inﬂuencing factors on pathogens removal
Factors affecting bacterial elimination in CWs include vegetation, hydraulic regime and retention time, water composition, seasonal variations, and pH (Davies-Colley et al., 1999). For free water surface ﬂow
CWs, sunlight intensity and exposure time are also critical inﬂuencing
factors (Mayo, 2004) as are matrix type and size for subsurface ﬂow

CWs (García et al., 2008). This section mainly discusses these inﬂuencing factors.

4.1. Vegetation
A number of investigations have been conducted to evaluate the effect of vegetation on indicator bacteria removal in CWs. Removal efﬁciency appears to be dependent on the type of CWs. In most of the
investigations concerning horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs, vegetation
was demonstrated to positively promote indicator bacteria removal
performance. However, it was unclear whether this was due to the effects of the plants on system hydraulics or to other causes, such as the
increased surface area availability at plant roots (Kansiime and van
Bruggen, 2001), or root exudates released by plant species that contain
bactericidal activity (Tunçsiper et al., 2012). The release of antimicrobial
exudates might not only be toxic to pathogenic microorganisms, but
also alter the physical and chemical environment of the rhizosphere
and lead to it being unsuitable for pathogen survival (Avelar et al.,
2014).
Avelar et al. (2014) compared the performance of horizontal ﬂow
CWs, either cultivated with or without the species Mentha aquatica,
when subjected to different hydraulic retention times (HRTs from 1.5
to 6.0 d) with regard to the removal of coliform bacteria from sewage.
They observed that the cultivation of the species M. aquatica resulted
in a higher removal efﬁciency of TC and E. coli in the experimental
CWs. Additionally, Decamp et al. (1999) also found greater removal of
E. coli in CWs planted with Phragmites australis (2.6 log10 CFU/100 mL)
than in systems without vegetation (1.4 log10 CFU/100 mL) (Decamp
et al., 1999). Rivera et al. (1995) observed greater removal of E. coli in
CWs planted with Typha or Phragmites than in CWs without plant cultivation. No signiﬁcant difference in removal performance between the
various plant species was observed (Rivera et al., 1995). In contrast,
Headley et al. (2013) found no effect of vegetation on E. coli removal
in VF, HF and intensiﬁed CWs.
In order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of CWs for the treatment of domestic
wastewater in small communities located in rural areas, Hench et al.
(2003) designed wetland mesocosms (400 L each) containing two
types of treatment (a mixture of Typha, Scirpus, and Juncus species and
a control without vegetation). Higher microbial reductions of FC, enterococci, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and coliphage were observed in
the planted microcosms compared to those lacking vegetation
(Table 1). Tanner et al. (1995) in a study performed in New Zealand obtained removals of 1.3, 1.3, 1.9 and 2.4 log10 CFU/100 mL of thermotolerant coliforms in horizontal ﬂow CWs planted with Schoenoplectus
validus and 1.0, 1.2, 1.1 and 2.0 log10 CFU/100 mL in unplanted CW
with HRT values of 2, 3, 5.5 and 7 days, respectively (Tanner et al.,
1995). Jinadasa et al. (2006) also examined the effect of Scirpus grossus
on the elimination of FC in horizontal ﬂow CWs. Under the same average inﬂuent concentration of 842 CFU/100 mL, efﬂuent FC was much

lower in the planted wetland (83 CFU/100 mL) than in the unplanted
control (208 CFU/100 mL) (Jinadasa et al., 2006).
However, for intermittent fed vertical ﬂow CWs, no signiﬁcant difference in the removal efﬁciency of planted and non-planted in CWs
was observed by Torrens et al. (2009). These results indicate that the
presence of macrophytes is of minor importance for the removal of microorganisms in vertical intermittently dosed CWs (Torrens et al.,
2009). This might be due to the fact that planted and non-planted ﬁlters
in vertical ﬂow CWs presented the same ﬂow patterns, with similar
mean HRT, oxygen condition and detention time distribution as determined by tracer measurement. However, there should be more investigations to prove this conclusion.
For free water surface ﬂow CWs, the role of wetland plants on indicator bacteria removal is different from those in other subsurface ﬂow
CW systems. MacIntyre et al. (2006) found that the E. coli content decreased when ﬂoating plants (e.g. Lemna sp.) were removed from the
beds. This suggested that E. coli might survive longer because these
plants provide attachment sites, UV shading, and reduce surface oxygen
exchange, which might decrease predator zooplankton populations
(MacIntyre et al., 2006).
4.2. Water compositions
The quality of wastewater will affect their subsequent disinfection
and the potential for bacteria survival within the CW and in following
treatments. The regrowth of bacteria can be stimulated by an increase
in organic concentration and nutrients. Diaz et al. (2010) and
Gagliardi and Karns (2000) reported a positive correlation between
indicator bacteria numbers and concentrations of ﬁxed nitrogen compounds, showing that these microbes might survive longer or replicate
faster in the presence of available nitrogen (Diaz et al., 2010; Gagliardi
and Karns, 2000). Reduced removal of indicator bacteria was observed
under conditions of organic- and surfactant-rich water. These compounds are known to reduce bacterial adsorption in porous media by
competing for adsorption sites (Stevik et al., 2004) and reducing the afﬁnity of bacterial surfaces for adsorption (Brown and Jaffé, 2001).
Therefore, the interaction of organics and nutrients with indicator bacteria removal is not only dependent on their effect on survival, but
also on their competition for adsorption sites on substrate surface.
The removal of suspended solids is also an important factor as particulate matter could shield fecal indicator bacteria from disinfection
(Winward et al., 2008b). Moreover, the size and density of the particles
and associated bacteria in each wastewater type will also affect the
resulting rate of removal due to settling. For example; if E. coli is
adsorbed to small light-weight organic particles, sedimentation might
be negligible, however, if E. coli is associated with larger, denser inorganic particles, sedimentation will likely be signiﬁcant (Boutilier et al.,
2009).
Experiments were conducted using two different types of wastewater to examine how efﬂuent characteristics inﬂuence speciﬁc mechanisms for E. coli removal (Boutilier et al., 2009). E. coli survived longer
in dairy wastewater because of the higher nutrient and solids concentrations. Nutrients provide resources for microorganism metabolism
and solids content has been shown to increase bacteria survival
(Boutilier et al., 2009; Howell et al., 1996). The linear relationship between pollutant loading and removal rate of indicator bacteria was
also investigated by Tunçsiper et al. (2012) in a pilot-scale combined
CW system. Statistical analyses conﬁrmed the existence of these relationships and implied that coliforms removal rate depends on the loading rate and strength of the wastewater.
CWs have been shown to improve the quality of treated wastewater.
However, considering the inﬂuence of water compositions on the removal of indicator bacteria, the capacity of CWs to reduce indicator bacteria under normal operating conditions cannot be extrapolated to
periods of incidental peak discharges. The buffering capacity of CWs
during peak discharges is potentially a key factor affecting quality in

13

receiving waters. Mulling et al. (2013) investigated the removal of pathogenic organisms and the behavior of concentration-peak discharges of
suspended particles from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a
full-scale free water surface ﬂow CW (Mulling et al., 2013). Their results
showed a lower buffering capacity for pathogens (40–84%) during peak
discharges, indicating differences between the removal processes of
suspended particles and pathogens. Suspended particles were probably
mostly removed by sedimentation and mineralization, while pathogens
were more likely removed by bioﬁlm detainment and mortality including predation.
4.3. Hydraulic regime
Wetland hydraulic regime has a direct effect on bacterial removal
mechanisms. In free water surface ﬂow CWs, the hydraulic conductivity
of both the gravel bed and the rhizosphere zone is negligible (García
et al., 2008). The main role of macrophytes in free water surface ﬂow
CWs appears to be to provide an extra surface for the development of
bioﬁlm on the plant-submerged parts (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009).
However, in subsurface ﬂow systems, the hydraulic conductivity of
the substrate is an important design parameter that needs to be taken
into account. García et al. (2008) observed relatively higher removal
rates (5 × 108 CFU/m2/d for FC, 5 × 107 CFU/m2/d for FS, 5.7 ×
107 CFU/m2/d for ST and 1.9 × 107 CFU/m2/d for CLP) in subsurface horizontal ﬂow CWs than in free water CWs, with the exception of TC,
which was removed more efﬁciently by free water CWs (1.7 ×
1010 CFU/m2/d) (García et al., 2008). No difference in removal performance was reported between vertical and horizontal ﬁlters (Ulrich
et al., 2005).
Alternate drying and wetting cycle subjects the wetland system to
alternate saturated and unsaturated ﬂow regimes, which results in
moisture variation within the system. These ﬂuctuations in moisture
proﬁle have been shown to affect pathogen removal rates in CWs
(Kadam et al., 2008). Moreover, rapid drainage might enhance atmospheric oxygenation of the treatment bed, creating a better condition
for bioﬁlm development. Tunçsiper et al. (2012) determined average
coliforms bacteria removal before and after rapid drainage, and found
that the average FC and TC removal efﬁciencies of the bed were increased approximately between 2 to 4% after rapid drainage. This result
suggested that the bed might be better ventilated upon rapid drainage
(Tunçsiper et al., 2012). However, this effect of rapid drainage on pathogen removal was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Hydraulic overloading of the treatment system could reduce the
removal efﬁciency of FC, potentially due to decreased adsorption to
the bioﬁlm. That could also explain that increased precipitation and
ﬂows could hinder microorganism removal (Pundsack et al., 2001).
Malfunctions (clogging and freezing of inlet pipes) could lead to hydraulic short circuits that bypass soil ﬁltration and consequently result
in a reduction or even a collapse of removal performance (Ulrich et al.,
2005).
Although recirculation of the efﬂuent could alter the hydraulic regime, it did not appear to inﬂuence fecal indicator bacteria removal performance. The effect of recycling of ﬁnal efﬂuent to the second bed was
also evaluated in a pilot-scale VF + HF + VF three stage combined CW
system (Tunçsiper et al., 2012). During loadings with and without
recycling, the average percent removals of FC and TC were approximately at the same levels at both the ﬁrst and second bed. Furthermore,
analysis of variance showed that recycling had no effect on the elimination of coliforms bacteria. These results are in agreement with those of
Arias et al. (2003).
4.4. Hydraulic retention time
The importance of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on indicator bacteria removal in CWs has been demonstrated by the fact that longer
HRTs increase bacteria exposure to removal processes, such as



14

S. Wu et al. / Science of the Total Environment 541 (2016) 8–22

sedimentation, adsorption to organic matter, predation, impact of
toxins from microorganisms or plants, and UV radiation (Diaz et al.,
2010). HRT depends on various factors including vegetation, texture of
the substrate (the porous media), water depth, and ﬂow velocities in
the CW (Kansiime and van Bruggen, 2001). It has been well recognized
that inefﬁciencies in hydraulics are a major barrier to optimize the removal of pathogens in CWs. Short-circuiting can result in water having
a range of residence times in wetlands and reduce their treatment efﬁciencies. This is especially detrimental for wetlands designed to remove
waterborne pathogens, which require reduction in a concentration of
several orders of magnitude and thus are severely compromised by
even a modest amount of short-circuiting (Jasper et al., 2013). To demonstrate this point, consider a wetland that is designed to provide 4-log
removal (99.99%) of an indicator microbe under ideal plug ﬂow conditions. If just 20% of the ﬂow has one-eighth of the nominal residence
time, as observed by Lightbody et al. (2008) in a recently constructed
wetland, the actual removal will be only about 1-log (90%) (Lightbody
et al., 2008).
Sawaittayothin and Polprasert (2007) reported a positive correlation
between fecal indicator removal and HRTs in a horizontal subsurface
ﬂow CW (Table 2). Tunçsiper et al. (2012) also found that an increase
in HRT considerably affects the removal efﬁciency for both FC and TC.
The relationships between HRT and average removals were shown to
be polynomial (Tunçsiper et al., 2012). Removal performances increased during the ﬁrst three days of operation, and then started to decrease. It has been reported that microbial inactivation reaches
saturation values when HRT is approximately three days (García et al.,
2003). Moreover, this trend might be related to the assumption that
ﬁrst-order microbial decay is irrelevant as HRT rises (Kadlec and
Wallace, 2009).
In the study by Tanner et al. (1995) already mentioned in
Section 4.1, an HRT of 7 days was about twice as effective in coliforms
removal as compared to an HRT of 2 days. In horizontal subsurface
ﬂow CWs cultivated with Typha angustifolia and operating at HRT of
1.5, 3, 5 and 6 days, removals of TC were 0.8, 1.7, 2.3 and 2.4 log10
CFU/100 mL, respectively (Khatiwada and Polprasert, 1999). Solano
et al. (2004a, 2004b) obtained removals of E. coli of 1.3 and 1.1 log10
CFU/100 m, respectively, in horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs cultivated
with P. australis and operating at HRT of 3.0 and 1.5 days (Solano
et al., 2004b). In addition, Diaz et al. (2010) investigated treatment of
agricultural runoff in four surface ﬂow CWs with different HRTs and
found a strong relationship between removal efﬁciency and HRTs. In
contrast, the relationship between removal efﬁciency for enterococci
and HRTs was not clear (Diaz et al., 2010).
Solano et al. (2004a, 2004b) evaluated the treatment performance of
a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface-ﬂow CW. Their results demonstrated
that during the ﬁrst year, there was no signiﬁcant relationship between
the removal of TC, FC and FS from raw municipal wastewater and hydraulic application rate. However, in the second year of wetland operation, the best removal efﬁciency was found in those beds with the
lowest hydraulic application rate (75 mm day−1) and the longest retention times (3 days). These results also indicated that HRT is an important

retention times (HRTs) in a horizontal subsurface ﬂow CW (Sawaittayothin and
Polprasert, 2007).

factor inﬂuencing bacterial inactivation, particularly in long-term
operation (Solano et al., 2004a). Considering the better performance
of fecal indicator bacteria removal at longer HRT, a buffered horizontal
subsurface ﬂow CWs as shown in Fig. 3 appears to be a promising approach for bacteria removal.
Regarding vertical ﬂow intermittently dosed CWs, Torrens et al.
(2009) demonstrated that ﬁlters with a depth of 65 cm facilitated significantly higher removal of bacterial and viral indicators than those of
25 cm (p b 0.05). Tracer tests showed that water ﬂowed faster through
the ﬁlters with a depth of 25 cm than through those of 65 cm. It is remarkable that a depth increase of only 40 cm resulted in an augmentation of the mean residence times by 3 to 5 h (Torrens et al., 2009).
Moreover, a correlation between the log removal of FC and the mean
HRT was found. In addition, a second correlation between the removal
rates and a minimum retention time was demonstrated (Fig. 4). Although both parameters had a signiﬁcant effect on FC removal (p b
0.05), a better correlation was found with minimum retention time.
The use of minimum retention time instead of mean retention time is
more appropriate for predicting microorganism removal based on the
breakthrough curves in unsaturated ﬁlters. The minimum retention
time would better represent the fraction of the dose applied that spends
the least time in the vertical ﬁlters (Torrens et al., 2009).

4.5. Filter media
Redder et al. (2010) investigated the inﬂuence of two different ﬁlter
materials on the removal of protozoan pathogens, C. oocysts and Giardia
cysts. In their experiment, 7 pilot scale subsurface ﬂow CWs, including
both vertical and horizontal ﬂow types, were ﬁlled with washed sand
(grain size, 0–2 mm), while 7 other wetlands were ﬁlled with a mixture
of expanded clay and sand, of grain size of 2–4 mm and 0–2 mm, respectively. Their results indicated that ﬁltering of wastewater was the main
effective mechanism of reducing protozoan parasites. The removal of C.
oocysts and Giardia cysts, however, seemed to be independent of the ﬁlter types used. However, small particle sizes (0–2 mm sand particles)
appeared to favor bacteria reduction. Likewise, Tanner et al. (2012) observed better elimination of E. coli in a vertical ﬂow bed ﬁlled with ﬁne
sand as compared to a bed ﬁlled with coarser gravel (3.2 versus 1.9 log10
CFU/100 mL removal). Therefore, physical processes like adsorption, ﬁltration and sedimentation associated with particle size are apparently
important factors.
The role of granular medium in removal of FC and somatic coliphages was investigated in four parallel horizontal subsurface ﬂow
CWs, each one containing a different type of granular medium. Microbial inactivation ratio ranged between 0.1 and 2.7 log10 CFU/100 mL for FC
and 0.5 to 1.7 log10 CFU/100 mL for somatic coliphages in beds with
coarser granular material (5–25 mm), while it ranged between 0.7
and 3.4 log10 units for FC and from 0.9 to 2.6 log10CFU/100 mL for somatic coliphages in beds with ﬁner material (2–13 mm) (García et al.,
2003). Torrens et al. (2009) also found no signiﬁcant difference
(p N 0.05) between two kinds of sand (crushed and river) in microbial
indicator removal in vertical ﬂow intermittent dosed CWs. These results
indicated that if the particle size distribution is suitable, the use of

alluvial material is not indispensable. Sand from quarries might also be
used after crushing and sieving (Torrens et al., 2009).
4.6. Oxygen
Previous studies have correlated increased dissolved oxygen with
bacterial die-off in aquatic environment (Fernández et al., 1992;
Pearson et al., 1987). Fernández et al. (1992) have reported 8–10 fold increase in bacterial die-off rate constant for TC, FC, FS and CLP in response
to short aeration treatment (2 h per day) in aquatic environment.
Winward et al. (2008a, 2008b) observed a higher performance of bacteria removal in vertical ﬂow CWs as compare to that in horizontal ﬂow
CWs, indicating that aerobic unsaturated removal pathways might be
more appropriate for bacteria removal in cases of gray water treatment
(Winward et al., 2008a). Recently, an intensive comparison of E. coli removal in different types of CWs all fed with the same inﬂuent revealed a
remarkable performance of an aerated system (Headley et al., 2013).
The precise effect of oxygen in such aerated systems remains to be
elucidated.
4.7. Solar intensity
Sunlight-mediated inactivation is one of the most important disinfection mechanisms in pathogen removal in free water surface ﬂow
CWs. Higher solar intensity provides higher UV radiation and thus promotes pathogen removal performance. However, for subsurface ﬂow
CWs including horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs and vertical subsurface
ﬂow CWs, the effect from solar intensity is negligible, due to the unexposed wastewater under-ﬂow in the wetland beds. Mayo (2004) developed a model describing the kinetics of coliforms mortality and removal
in free water surface CWs. Their results showed that bacterial mortality
rate constant was largely inﬂuenced by sunlight intensity, which was
responsible for 72.6% of removal (Mayo, 2004). The importance of
sunlight-mediated disinfection in surface ﬂow treatment wetlands
was also illustrated when E. coli concentrations declined signiﬁcantly
after a thick bed of ﬂoating duckweed (Lemna sp.) had been removed
from a newly constructed surface ﬂow wetland (MacIntyre et al.,
2006). A better understanding of the sunlight-mediated inactivation
mechanisms and their roles in bacteria removal is needed to optimize
the design and to enable prediction of the fate of bacteria in surface
ﬂow CWs (Jasper et al., 2013).
4.8. pH
The low pH in some CWs could also result in a faster die-off of FC.
These microbes have been reported to survive better at pH values between 5.5 and 7.5, and survival rapidly decline at pH above and below
this range (McFeters and Stuart, 1972; Šolić and Krstulović, 1992).
Most pH values in wetland efﬂuents fall within this optimal range, however, CWs efﬂuent with low pH also exists due to e.g. high rates of bacterial nitriﬁcation of ammonium in the ﬁlter bed and high levels of
natural humic and tannic acids, which are also known to process antiviral effects (Olson et al., 2004). Cases of low pH were reported by

Pundsack et al. (2001), i.e. in the range of 3.9 to 6.9, and 3.7 to 4.7, respectively, due to the aforementioned rapid nitriﬁcation process and
acids production. This low pH was shown to contribute to greater Salmonella reduction rates (Pundsack et al., 2001). Moreover, diurnal pH
shifts induced by algal photosynthesis in lagoon and/or lakes has well
been shown to be a major factor driving pathogen removal, but quantitative evaluation in free water surface ﬂow CWs was less reported.
4.9. Seasonal ﬂuctuation
With regards to seasonal ﬂuctuation, some authors have observed
higher removal efﬁciencies of indicator bacteria in CWs during warm
seasons (Elhamouri et al., 1994; Karathanasis et al., 2003) whereas
others found no seasonal changes (García et al., 2008; Tunçsiper et al.,
2012). Thus seasonal ﬂuctuation on bacteria removal in CWs might
not only be related to temperature but also to the status of plants. Temperature is generally acknowledged to be an important factor in determining pathogens survival in the environment (Blanc and Nasser,
1996). As temperature increases, bacterial and protozoan metabolic
processes accelerate, predation increases, and degradative enzymes
produced by plants, fungi or bacteria could degrade faster viral capsids
and damage viral DNA or RNA (Olson et al., 2004). Winward et al.
(2008a) reported that seasonal temperature changes could strongly inﬂuence the removal of indicator bacteria in horizontal ﬂow CWs, in
which bacteria removal increased as temperature increased. However,
temperature did not affect bacteria removal performance in vertical
ﬂow CWs. The effect of seasonal temperature change indicates that inactivation of microorganisms in horizontal ﬂow CWs, similar to physical
adsorption or ﬁltration, is also a key mechanism for bacteria removal.
This inactivation of bacteria within CWs apparently occurs apparently
through competition for nutrients and exposure to inhibitory secretions
from other bacteria (Stevik et al., 2004), virus-induced lysis (Fischer
et al., 2006), and predation by protozoa (Decamp and Warren, 1998).
The ﬁrst order inactivation rate constants for E. coli within the CWs
were calculated to be 0.09 d− 1 at 7.6 °C to 0.18 d−1 at 22.8 °C
(Boutilier et al., 2009). The associated temperature correction coefﬁcient (q) was computed to be 1.05, which indicates strong temperature
dependence. Ulrich et al. (2005) found that when comparing a summer
operation vs. a winter operation CWs, higher wastewater temperatures
could improve the removal performance by about 1 log10 CFU/100 mL,
provided that other factors (e.g., microorganism concentrations,
hydraulic loading/overloading) do not affect the annual variation pattern. In addition, the seasonal treatment efﬁciency of a pilot-scale CW
system with a free water surface bed followed by a horizontal subsurface ﬂow bed, which was located outdoor in a semi-arid, temperate
climate, was evaluated for greywater treatment in a 1-year study. The
results showed that the wetland substantially removed more E. coli
(1.7 log10CFU/100 mL) in fall, spring, and summer, than in winter
(1.0 log10 CFU/100 mL) (Jokerst et al., 2011).
Typically, the rate of E. coli inactivation increases with warmer temperatures and increased UV radiation during the summer months
(Easton et al., 2005). However, Quiñónez-Díaz et al. (2001) indicated
that shading provided by vegetation might reduce exposure to UV

light in the warm seasons and might decrease the removal of microorganisms in free water surface ﬂow CWs (Quiñónez-Díaz et al., 2001).
MacIntyre et al. (2006) also suggested that E. coli might survive longer
when ﬂoating plants are present since these plants could provide
attachment sites, UV shading, and reduce surface oxygen exchange,
which would decrease the predatory zooplankton populations
(MacIntyre et al., 2006). Moreover, a positive correlation between
the incidence of total and FC versus temperature was reported by
Thurston et al. (2001) for subsurface ﬂow systems. Their results indicated that the concentration of coliforms bacteria increased concomitantly
with an increase in temperature. However, the increase in both TC and
FC in the summer compared to that in the winter months might have
occurred as a result of animal activity, seasonal variation in plant
growth, or proliferation of coliforms within the wetland (Thurston
et al., 2001). Notably, seasonal effects could also be related to the rainfall
pattern and in many tropical countries this may be largely inﬂuenced by
the monsoonal system. In summer seasons, microorganism concentrations could be strongly diluted during intense precipitation events or inﬂow of water from other sources, leading to lower removal rates and
consequently reducing the performance of CWs.

5. Overall performance
As summarized in Table 3 and Table 4, the majority of published
studies investigated bacteria removal in either free water surface ﬂow
CWs or horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs. Both types of CWs have the potential to remove substantial quantities of fecal indicator bacteria. Based
on the data collected from Tables 3, 4 and 5, the removal of the fecal indicator bacteria such as TC, FC, E. coli, FS, C. perfringens and staphylococci
appears to be exponentially related to the loading rate (Fig. 5). However, a single stage CW is usually not enough for reaching the standards
recommended for wastewater reuse (Galvão et al., 2009). Therefore, it
has been suggested that combining different wetland based systems
might increase indicator bacteria removal rates (García et al., 2013).

Table 5 summarizes the removal performance for E. coli, TC and FC in
various reported combinations/trains of free water CWs, vertical ﬂow and
horizontal ﬂow CWs. Based on the data collected in Tables 3, 4 and 5, the
averages of these fecal indicator bacteria reduction after the wastewater
ﬂow through these three type CWs were calculated and depicted in Fig.
6. Generally, horizontal subsurface ﬂow CWs have better capacity than
free water surface ﬂow CWs for the removal of E. coli (+1.1 log10 CFU/
100 mL), FC (+0.2 log10 CFU/100 mL), FS (+0.9 log10 CFU/100 mL),
C. perfringens (+0.6 log10 CFU/100 mL) and staphylococci (+0.8 log10
CFU/100 mL), with the exception of TC (− 0.9 log10 CFU/100 mL). As
compared to horizontal ﬂow CWs, the combined CWs could further improve the removal of E. coli, TC and FC by 1.5, 1.2, 0.3 log10 CFU/100 mL,
respectively. Although the combination of different type of CWs in one
train signiﬁcantly increases the reduction of pathogens, the level of
pathogen in the efﬂuent of these CWs is still higher than acceptable
for most reuse regulations (García et al., 2013). As shown in Table 6,
WHO (1989) guidelines for the safe use of wastewater in agriculture
took into account of fecal coliforms to be less than 1000 CFU/100 mL
for food crops eaten raw. USEPA and USAID (1992) recommended
even much stricter guidelines for wastewater reuse in the USA. For irrigation of crops likely to be eaten uncooked, no detectable FC/100 mL are
allowed.
Thus, for many potential application sites where no more space
would be economically available for increasing the wetland dimensions,
either further improvements of the wetland technology or a combination with subsequent treatment of the wetland efﬂuent are needed to
eliminate the health risks associated with wastewater used for crop irrigation and landscaping (Richter and Weaver, 2003b). Aeration of the
wetland bed, as one mode of treatment intensiﬁcations, appears to be
a promising approach (Headley et al., 2013). In an aerated horizontal
ﬂow CW a 3.3 log10 CFU reduction per 100 mL of E. coli was achieved
whereas non-aerated horizontal ﬂow CWs had a log10 CFU reduction/
100 mL of around 1.4.
Alternatively, chemical or physical disinfection methods may be
used to Polish wetland efﬂuents. The principal advantage of employing

those methods in combination with the CW technology rather than as
stand-alone units is that the reduced total suspended solid (TSS) level
in CW efﬂuent improves their operational effectiveness. Water with
lower amounts of TSS requires lower chlorination. Indeed, investigations from Verlicchi et al. (2012) indicate that it is possible to reduce
the dosage of NaClO in a combined disinfection system including a

mild chlorination and a CW; and Azaizeh et al. (2013) also showed
the possibility of satisfactory removal of enteric pathogens from gray
water by an integrated system combining CW and UV disinfection system. Likewise the efﬁciency of UV light disinfection depends on the
wastewater's transmittance. High transmittance demands low TSS concentration due to particles reﬂection of UV light that causes lower

transmittance (Galvão et al., 2009). Sklarz et al. (2009) reported a combination of a re-circulated vertical ﬂow CW with UV irradiation for enhancing disinfection performance. The results showed that levels of
E. coli declined from 107 to 104 CFU/100 mL in the re-circulated vertical
ﬂow CW prior to UV irradiation. Further reduction to level consistent
with Israeli regulations for urban landscape irrigation of 10 CFU/
100 mL was achieved after the water was passed through the UV irradiation unit at a minimal contact time of 1.5 min (Sklarz et al., 2009).
Moreover, the performance of FC and E. coli removal in UV system
coupled to CWs for gray water treatment in Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority was also demonstrated by Azaizeh et al. (2013). Results
showed that after reduction of COD load in CWs, FC and E. coli can be signiﬁcantly reduced to the level suitable for irrigation, even when UV
transmission levels were low (∼40%). However, UV disinfection is not
always suitable for disinfection of efﬂuent from subsurface ﬂow CWs
due to the development of coatings like bioﬁlms on the bulbs that
might block UV light (Richter and Weaver, 2003b). The performance

of UV disinfection after CWs also depends on water quality of wetland
efﬂuent and might only works efﬁciently when the organics and nutrients, which might limit the fast growth of bioﬁlm on the bulbs, are successfully removed.
Combining CWs with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as
photocatalytic ozonation (UV/TiO2/O3), might be another option to disinfect and detoxify wastewaters (Antoniadis et al., 2010; Graﬁas et al.,
2010). Arends et al. (2014) presented a new concept on a combined system, which aims to maximize the beneﬁts of both CWs and plantmicrobial fuel cell. Electrical power could be generated based on the
subsequent action of plant photosynthesis, root exudation processes
and oxidation of organic matters by microorganisms by electron transfer to an anode. Interestingly, the cathode reaction could be tuned towards the production of hydrogen peroxide from air-derived oxygen,
enabling disinfectant production from wastewater (Modin and
Fukushi, 2013). However, these combining technologies have not yet
been demonstrated in full-scale systems.
6. Conclusions and perspectives
The reuse of properly treated wastewater has become more attractive due to water shortages and demands of rapidly evolving industrial
processes in recent years. CWs as environmental friendly ecosystems
have been widely applied not only for various water pollution controls
but also for fecal bacteria reduction and presumably human pathogens.
Although current literature contains a wealth of information on the
overall removal of indicator bacteria in different types of CWs and suggestions on mechanisms for removal like adsorption, sedimentation and
predation, the magnitude of the various processes and inﬂuencing factors is still poorly understood due to the complex micro/macro environments in the root zones within CWs. Therefore, further research and
developments are necessary to increase the efﬁciency of bacteria removal in wastewater. In summary:

wastewater ﬂows through wetland beds. (TC: total coliforms; FC: fecal coliforms; EC:
Escherichia coli; FS: fecal streptococci).

▪ Even though some investigations explored the importance of individual sources (Ottosson and Stenström, 2003; Thurston et al.,
2001; Graczyk et al., 2009a, 2009b), these results were hard to compare and integrate because they were obtained from different wetlands, hydraulic regimes, and environmental conditions. A
quantitative assessment of these sources in typical CWs would not
only facilitate better understanding of the removal mechanisms of
indicator bacteria in CWs, but might also help with the development
of guidelines for designing disinfection processes.

Escherichia coli; FS: fecal streptococci; CLP: Clostridium perfringens; ST: staphylococci).

▪ Difﬁculties in exploring the fate of indicator bacteria in CWs are also
strongly related to the complex interaction networks of abiotic and
biotic factors. For examples, hydraulic regime could be affected by
wetland conﬁgurations, and matrix size and distribution, and vegetation density could further inﬂuence hydraulic retention time. Seasonal impact also affects growth of wetland plants and solar
intensity. These hydraulic related and seasonal related factors
might simultaneously inﬂuence the overall performance of pathogen and indicator bacteria removal.
▪ Although the fact that better bacterial removal efﬁciency was observed in most traditional horizontal subsurface ﬂow planted CWs
than in unplanted control systems, there is no clear evidence of a direct effect of the metabolic activity of macrophytes on bacteria removal and more speciﬁc studies are needed.
▪ Besides traditional free water surface ﬂow, horizontal subsurface
ﬂow and vertical ﬂow CWs, there are an increasing number of
newly developed CWs with different conﬁgurations and operational
strategies, like aerated and tidal operated CWs. The results obtained
thus far show remarkable bacteria removal efﬁciencies. Further assessments and mechanistic interpretations of indicator bacteria removal may guide the way to signiﬁcant pathogen elimination in
these newly developed CWs.
▪ Given the time-consuming and often costly nature of the procedures
for quantifying microbial pathogens, monitoring a speciﬁc range of
indicator organisms in reclaimed efﬂuent is often performed to assess whether water poses human health risk. Yet with the rising

public health concern associated with pathogen contamination of
wastewater, standards for water quality will likely become higher.
Therefore, detailed investigation of a wider spectrum of indicator
bacteria might be necessary.
▪ Activated sludge-type wastewater treatment plants are considered
as hot spots for the dispersal of microbes carrying antibiotic resistance genes into the environment (Rizzo et al., 2013). The risk associated with that dispersal is difﬁcult to estimate (Berendonk et al.,
2015). First investigations suggest that CWs are better in retaining
or even eliminating antibiotic-resistant bacteria than activated
sludge-type wastewater treatment plants (Liu et al., 2013; Nõlvak
et al., 2013; Sidrach-Cardona and Bécares, 2013). The elimination
mechanisms and the long-term fate of antibiotic resistant bacteria
in CWs appears to be a rather promising ﬁeld for future investigations on and implementations of such wastewater treatment units.
