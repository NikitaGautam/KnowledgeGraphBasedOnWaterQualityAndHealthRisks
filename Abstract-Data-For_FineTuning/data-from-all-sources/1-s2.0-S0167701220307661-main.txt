ABSTRACT

SourceTracker

The development of Microbial Source Tracking (MST) technologies was borne out of necessity. This was largely
due to the: 1) inadequacies of the fecal indicator bacterial paradigm, 2) fact that many fecal bacteria can survive
and often grow in the environment, 3) inability of traditional microbiological methods to attribute source, 4)
lack of correspondence between numbers of fecal indicator bacteria in waterways and many human pathogens,
and 5) source allocation requirements and load determinations needed for total maximum daily loads. The MST
tools have changed over time, evolving from culture-dependent to culture-independent molecular analyses.
More recently, MST tools based on microbial community analyses, mainly DNA sequencing-based approaches,
have been developed in an attempt to overcome some of these issues. These approaches generate large data sets
and require the use of sophisticated machine learning algorithms to allocate potential host sources to contaminated waterways. In this review we discuss the origins and needs for community-based MST methods, as
well as elaborate on the Bayesian algorithm-based program SourceTracker, which is increasingly being used for
the determination of sources of fecal contamination of waterways.

1. Microbial water quality
Clean and safe water for drinking and recreation is paramount for
modern civilization. In most cases, the safety of water and waterways is
ascertained by quantifying fecal bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli,
Enterococcus spp., and, in some instances, viruses (Dufour and Schaub,
2007). While this indicator paradigm has been used for decades, there is
ample evidence showing that these bacteria can grow and reproduce in
the environment, limiting their use as indicators of fecal contamination
(Byappanahalli et al., 2012; Ishii and Sadowsky, 2008; Jang et al.,
2017). Moreover, there is often little relationship between pathogen
loading and the numbers of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (Ishii et al.,
2014; Lemarchand and Lebaron, 2003; Wu et al., 2011). In addition,
measurements of FIB often rely on the use of culture-based methods
that are laborious, time sensitive, and do not give results in a timely
manner (Dorevitch et al., 2017). Moreover, they lack the ability to
determine source attribution often required for abatement strategies.
This renders them not useful for their intended purpose and confounds
their use for water quality monitoring, stormwater and beach management, and load determinations meant to satisfy local, state, or

federal water quality standards. These major limitations led to the development of microbial source tracking (MST) technologies to identify
the source(s) of fecal pollution in waterways with the goal to guide
abatement or remediation strategies (Harwood et al., 2014).
2. Microbial source tracking
MST methods were developed somewhat in parallel to those used
for tracking pathogens in food and human disease outbreaks (Riley and
Blanton, 2018), as well as to address limitations of traditional fecal
indicator methods. What differentiates MST use in water quality efforts
from other approaches is that rather than enumerating general indicator organisms (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001), such as fecal indicator
bacteria (Dufour and Schaub, 2007) or non-specific coliphages, efforts
are placed on identification of microbiota representative of a specific
host source animal. Although the techniques used have changed over
time, they have the same goals and are based on the hypothesis that
microbiota within the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of animals are the
source of host-associated microbiota (Kohl et al., 2018). Since it is
difficult to sample the GI tract directly, feces is used as a representative

surrogate for the microbiota found in the intestinal environment
(Hillman et al., 2017).
Many of the initial MST methods focused on determining whether
specific E. coli strains or enterococci grouped together in a host specific
manner. This was done using several traditional phenotypic and molecular methods and were generally characterized as being culture- and
library-dependent in nature (Scott et al., 2002; Simpson et al., 2002;
Stoeckel and Harwood, 2007). In these approaches, a series of E. coli or
Enterococcus isolates were obtained by culturing from different animal
feces and these strains were used in a host source library to compare
against similar characteristics (genotypic or phenotypic) of isolates
from these genera obtained from environment (Ahmed, 2007). The
questions asked were fairly simple, mainly, do environmental isolates
match any of those in the source library? Some of the initial studies
were done using phenotypic analyses such as antibiotic resistance
profiles and carbon source utilization patterns (Hagedorn et al., 2003;
Scott et al., 2002). Due to great heterogeneity and variation in phenotypes among E. coli or Enterococcus strains from the same host source
group, which was further complicated by variation due to location and
feeding habits, these approaches lost favor to more molecular-based
analyses (Myoda et al., 2003). These culture- and library-dependent
molecular methods included the use of rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting
(Dombek et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2004), ribotyping (Scott et al.,
2003), restriction fragment length polymorphism (Bernhard and Field,
2000), uidA gene sequencing (Ram et al., 2004), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Furukawa and Suzuki, 2013), and host species-specific
hybridization markers (Hamilton et al., 2006), to name a few. These
techniques also suffered some of the same limitations as did phenotypic
methods – small host source library size given genetic diversity, variation due to location and dietary differences, incomplete library
composition resulting in the inability to characterize a large proportion
of environmental isolates, and problems associated with cost and
throughput (Stewart et al., 2003; Stoeckel and Harwood, 2007).
Taken together, these problems led to a rapid evolution of methods
to ones favoring culture- and library-independent approaches. Chief
among these, and the first method to be used, was host source and
species group specific PCR (and later qPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA
gene of intestinal bacteria that likely have an evolutionary relationship
with the host, leading to host source specificity (Unno et al., 2018). This
marker gene approach was initially directed to Bacteroides spp. strains
having specificity for the human host, and relied on primer design from
16S rRNA gene sequence data or subtractive hybridizations (Dick et al.,
2005b; Field and Samadpour, 2007). This approach was subsequently
expanded to a variety of bacterial host source-specific marker genes
using this target bacterium, as well as Bifidobacterium spp., Catellicoccus,
Bacteroidales, Methanobrevibacter, and Lachnospiraceae (reviewed in
Harwood et al., 2014). In addition, several species/strain specific PCR
(and qPCR) assays have also been developed that target marker genes in
microbes related to non-human host sources such as cows (Shanks et al.,
2008), birds (Green et al., 2012), pigs (Mieszkin et al., 2009), dogs
(Dick et al., 2005b), and horses (Dick et al., 2005a). More recent studies
have used metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing approaches to define new host-source specific primers (Feng and
McLellan, 2019). In many respects, qPCR-based MST methods have
revolutionized the determination of potential sources of microbiota in
waterways, and are now widely used.
That said, as with most molecular tools, qPCR-based marker gene
methods are not without limitations and problems. These include issues
related to sensitivity, lack of specificity and cross reactivity across animal source groups, PCR inhibition, and the inability to detect recent
from past contamination events (Unno et al., 2018). In addition, there is
currently a lack of marker genes for all animal feces contaminating a
given watershed. Lastly, while it was originally thought that marker
gene targets would not survive long in the environment, recent studies
have shown that there is differential decay of these bacteria or their
DNA targets in the environment (Bae and Wuertz, 2009; Dick et al.,

2010; Korajkic et al., 2019; Schulz and Childers, 2011; Walters et al.,
2009). Consequently, if host source origin and a time variable are
needed in the analyses, then one needs to operationally determine the
decay of a particular marker indicator over time. It should be noted,
however, that the limitations and problems mentioned above are not
unique to qPCR-based MST methods.
3. Community-based MST
Some of the limitations mentioned above, along with advances in
DNA sequencing technologies, led to an evolution in culture-independent MST technologies (Tan et al., 2015). This has allowed
movement away from approaches targeting a single microorganism or
bacterial taxon to ones involving multiple taxa and microbial community-based approaches (Brown et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2013; Unno et al.,
2010, 2018). The majority of DNA sequencing technologies revolve
around relatively rapid, inexpensive, and high-throughput approaches.
These approaches generally rely on library-based technologies where
host source-specific fecal taxon libraries (FTL) serve as the comparator
to those taxa found in waterways. As with previous library-dependent
MST methods, the FTL used will likely be regionally based and must
take into account geographic and inter- and intra-animal variability
with respect to the composition of microbial communities in their feces
(Brown et al., 2019; Unno et al., 2018). These communities can indeed
be complex and may contain hundreds to thousands of microbial taxa,
only some of which can be enumerated by culture. Since only taxonomically relevant sequences are used, mainly those based on 16S
rRNA genes, the methods do not require microbial growth. The studies
rely on the basic premise that microbial communities present in waterways are reflective of a community of taxa found in feces from
known animal sources and present in the initial FTL. While initial
studies were done using DNA sequencing reads generated using 454
pyrosequencing technology (Ronaghi, 2001), this platform was largely
replaced by Illumina-based DNA sequencing systems (Gloor et al.,
2010). Modern Illumina-based platforms, such as the NovaSeq 6000
system, can produce several thousands of gigabase pairs (Gbp) of DNA
sequenced data from a single run (Shendure et al., 2017). However, this
capacity is not needed for most MST studies as amplicon sequencing
coupled with barcoded primers allows for ample sequence reads to be
produced from a large number of samples (Gohl et al., 2016; Unno
et al., 2010). That said, since community-based MST technologies are
data heavy, efficient computational routines and algorithms are needed
to determine potential sources of intestinal microbiota in waterways
(Knights et al., 2011; Unno et al., 2010).
4. MST using SourceTracker
4.1. Methodology
One of the first machine-learning MST tools utilizing highthroughput sequencing (HTS) data was the program SourceTracker
(Knights et al., 2011). Although previous methods have been proposed,
mostly aimed at sequence data generated via the Roche 454 platform
(Unno et al., 2010), most programs lacked adequate statistical testing
and technical issues made large scale projects cost prohibitive. The
SourceTracker program was originally designed to detect small
amounts of contamination from multiple sources, while also accounting
for uncertainty in community composition due to potentially unknown
sources. The program requires that the user input a count table of taxa
and to define samples as the potential sources of contamination or as
sinks for the contamination. A Bayesian algorithm then calculates prior
probabilities that taxa belong to specific source categories in order to
differentiate them. The source contribution to sink samples is then
calculated as a mixture of the sources provided. Predicted source allocations were shown by the developers to be more accurate than a
random forest machine learning approach, or even naïve Bayes

classification. In addition, the software is capable of determining which
individual taxa are contributed from each source, potentially allowing
for inferences related to relative health risks. The SourceTracker program has been utilized to estimate the proportion of microbial contamination that each individual source contributes to surface waters
(summarized in Table 1) and validated against hydrodynamic modeling
of source contamination (Henry et al., 2016). While the majority of the
SourceTracker-based MST studies have been done using 16S rRNA gene
sequencing analyses, some recent studies have leveraged shotgun sequencing data (Baral et al., 2018a; Chen et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2018; McGhee et al., 2020).

be dependent on the level of contamination by a particular source
(Brown et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2016; Knights et al., 2011) as well as
microbial background composition (Hägglund et al., 2018). The calculation of relative standard deviation (RSD) for each attributed source
improved overall predictive confidence in the results. For example,
Brown et al. (2017) showed that the RSD values obtained from the five
SourceTracker runs were negatively correlated with the size of the
predicted SourceTracker proportions. The authors reported that larger
SourceTracker proportions, such as those seen with effluent, had lower
RSD values, while smaller SourceTracker proportions such as geese and
gulls had higher RSD values. Therefore, it is likely that SourceTracker
may only be able to predict the presence of low-abundance sources but
is unable to provide an accurate quantitative measure of the microbial
load associated with the fecal input.
Because community-based microbial signatures are comprised of
several different taxa, their unique decay rates may affect the ability of
the SourceTracker program to accurately assign correct sources to
contamination in a watershed. To test this, Ahmed et al. (2018) examined the decay of sewage-associated bacterial communities in water
and sediment from marine and freshwater sites. Results showed that
sewage-associated operational taxonomic units decayed rapidly in all
mesocosms and were not detectable after day 4. These findings suggest
that SourceTracker can only detect recent contamination events as the
death of sewage-associated bacterial communities may occur rapidly in
the environment followed by DNA degradation (Korajkic et al., 2015;
Mattioli et al. 2017; Sassoubre et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015).

4.2. Efficacy and accuracy of SourceTracker as an MST tool
The accuracy of SourceTracker was recently tested in a doubleblinded study by Staley et al. (2018) using mixtures of five sources
spiked into recreational freshwater, at concentrations ranging from
0.025% to 10% (vol/vol). The tool was shown to be 91% accurate,
identifying 31 of 34 mixtures correctly with no false negatives. Furthermore, the source contributions predicted were strongly correlated
with the volumes of fecal materials spiked (ρ = 0.88, P < 0.001). The
authors compared the use of SourceTracker with more traditional HTS
approaches to identify source-specific microbial signatures (i.e., biomarkers). While the program utilized abundant taxa that were discriminatory for each source, a large proportion of the SourceTracker
allocation (≥ 50%) was associated with low-abundance taxa. The authors suggested that this utilization of rare taxa may explain discrepancies between SourceTracker and other molecular MST methods,
e.g., qPCR, with SourceTracker showing highly specific but less sensitive source identification, since qPCR targets may be nearer the limit of
detection of HTS. Nevertheless, detection of spiked sources at concentrations as low as 0.025% (vol/vol) suggests the tool is effective at
identifying biologically relevant levels of fecal contamination in this
study.
The accuracy of SourceTracker predictions has also been shown to

4.3. Practical considerations and limitations
4.3.1. Library configuration
Brown et al. (2019) found that SourceTracker predictions were
more spurious when all available sources were included in the FTL,
regardless if they were in the study area. For example, waterfowl, including gulls and geese, were consistently predicted in several mesocosms even if they were not expected to be present. This is probably
3

P.P. Mathai, et al.

because waterfowl feces harbor similar bacterial communities compared to freshwater (Brown et al., 2017; Unno et al., 2010). The authors
also reported that geese samples exhibited the greatest intragroup
variability among all input sources, which could make it harder for
SourceTracker to identify waterfowl or other sources which have
comparable bacterial community structures. Hence, to avoid erroneous
predictions, it is suggested that sources not likely to be present in the
study area be excluded from the FTL. However, if a source with high
intragroup variability (e.g., waterfowl) should be used, it might be
useful to split the source in smaller groups of the most closely related
samples, instead of using all the samples as a single source. Brown et al.
(2019) also demonstrated that SourceTracker yielded inaccurate predictions when known sources were missing. SourceTracker failed to
distinguish sources which could be easily differentiated when all of the
known sources were present. Collectively, these findings suggest that
before using SourceTracker for MST, it is critical to have a good understanding of the potential fecal sources impacting the study region.
Similarly, Staley et al. (2018) showed that the inclusion of geographically-associated (i.e., local) sources was necessary for accurate
source assignments. These authors demonstrated that fecal sources
collected locally could not be identified when tested against a library
comprised of sources collected from other geographical locations. When
blinded samples were evaluated using local sources, either alone or in
the full library of all sources (i.e., composite library), sources in blinded
samples were unambiguously identified, with no significant difference
in source assignments between libraries. Thus, the inclusion of nonlocal sources did not compromise the detection of sources in spiked
samples after the inclusion of local sources in the FTL. It has also been
reported that there was a low similarity between new and previously
characterized fecal sources from the same area, which suggests that
frequent library updates might be required for accurate source assignments (O'Dea et al., 2019), or that a decay function needs to be included
in analyses.
The inclusion of background assemblages as negative controls in the
FTL was found to be especially important when potential source categories are expected to be highly similar to sink communities (e.g., effluent and surface water) as a result of mixing or having a similar environmental background due to dilution (Brown et al., 2019; Hägglund
et al., 2018; Staley et al., 2017). For example, Staley et al. (2017)
showed that using “negative control” samples to account for unpolluted
environmental background communities was necessary for accurate
source predictions. When open ocean (negative control) samples were
excluded, a large proportion of source contamination among coral
samples was attributed to inlet and outfall samples due to the presence
of ubiquitous aquatic taxa. Similarly, Brown et al. (2019) showed that
when autochthonous taxa were accounted for, SourceTracker was able
to consistently predict the presence of most of the expected sources in
all of the mesocosms and fewer erroneous predictions occurred. These
results suggest that when SourceTracker is utilized without controlling
for the environmental context of fecal pollution, the algorithm may
artificially conflate the environmental signature with the fecal source
and overestimate the burden of pollution from the source.

individual samples were used among closely-related sources (Staley
et al., 2018).
5. Other methodologies and tools
The aim of this review was to primarily discuss amplicon-based
sequencing technology and the use of the SourceTracker program for
application to MST studies. It must be noted, however, that
SourceTracker is not the only community-based method that has been
used for source tracking. For example, array-based technologies (Cao
et al., 2013; Dubinsky et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015) have also been investigated as MST tools. Similarly, several other computational programs have been developed that use machine learning classification for
MST, including Random Forest (Dubinsky et al., 2016; Roguet et al.,
2018, 2020; Smith et al., 2010), FEAST (Shenhav et al., 2019), and a
method utilizing Aitchison distance (Carter et al., 2020). Since most of
these methods and tools have not been compared with SourceTracker in
surface waters, or use similar taxonomic breath of libraries, further
studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy in determining sources of
microbiota impacting waterways.
6. Concluding remarks
We are living in an exciting time and are moving away from using
single taxa determination of microbial contamination of waterways to
methods using more community-based approaches. These technologies
provide promising advantages over traditional culture-based fecal indicator approaches and single-target qPCR assays, which have been
increasingly employed over the last decades to improve monitoring
outcomes. Community-based HTS MST will allow for the identification
and probable quantification of multiple fecal sources of pollution and
overcome the high resource burdens associated with previous librarybased MST methods due to their high-throughput nature.
Despite the advantages that these community-based approaches will
provide to the field of MST, they still have limitations. Many of these
problems are ubiquitous among MST methods, and generally impact
our ability to protect water quality and public health. Classical limitations to the introduction of new tools for MST including determining
nonpoint sources of water contamination, the differential decay of
bacteria from different sources in waterways, vastly differing amounts
of fecal microbiota deposited in waterways by different animals
sources, a lack of clear relationship between pathogen loading and fecal
bacterial loading, and a lack of information concerning microbial
community composition and human health implications will need to be
considered. In addition, library-based considerations including representativeness of the source library as well as temporal and geographical stability of source communities are already recognized limitations that need to be addressed in experimental design (Ahmed,
2007).
Importantly, community based HTS MST methods have entered into
a promising, yet still experimental, stage. These tools will need to be
incorporated in the MST toolbox as academic centers partner with local
resource managers to evaluate both the methodological concerns and
practical efforts necessary to implement these techniques for near-realtime water quality monitoring. Thus, the next steps in this process will
include not only addressing technical limitations, but in identifying a
niche for these techniques that are both academically and practically
useful. While most of these problems are not insurmountable, they will
require concerted efforts from researchers and resource managers to
better use this technology.

4.3.2. Required Library size
Another important consideration with library-dependent sequencebased MST methods is to determine the appropriate library size of
samples for each source. This can be accomplished by using statistical
power analysis, which determines whether or not the sample size is
large enough to be able to detect significant differences between sample
groups (intra-source variability) (la Rosa et al., 2012). Recently, it has
been reported that a library size between 10 and 13 samples for each
source was needed in order to inform a powered analysis of statistically
significant differences in community composition (Brown et al., 2017;
Staley et al., 2018). Even though some studies have achieved expected
results in spite of using just a few individuals (Sun et al., 2016), sink
predictions were found to be far less accurate when lesser numbers of
