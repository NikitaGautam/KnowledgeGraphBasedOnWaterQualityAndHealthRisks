Health Hazards Associated with Windsurfing on Poliuted Water
ERIC DEWAILLY, MD, CLAUDE POIRIER, MD, FRANCOIS M . MEYER, MD,
Abstract: We documented the risks associated with windsurfing
on sewage polluted water. Seventy-nine windsurfers and 41 controls
were studied over a nine-day period for occurrence of symptoms of
gastroenteritis, otitis, conjunctivitis, and skin infection. Relative
risks were 2.9 for occurrence of one or more of these symptoms and
5.5 for symptoms of gastroenteritis. Relative risk increased with the
reported number of falls into the water. {Am J Public Health 1986;

Introduction
Windsurfing is an increasingly popular sport. It is tolerated on waters judged unsafe for swimming because of
pollution. For swimmers, gastroenteritis, otitis, conjunctivitis, infectious and allergic skin symptoms can be related to
fecal pollution of water,'~^ In August 1984, the Windsurfer
Western Hemisphere Championship was held in Quebec
City, on the St. Lawrence River in the baie de Beauport,
where water is contaminated by sewage. This event
prompted us to assess the health hazards associated with
windsurfing on polluted water.
Methods
In the baie de Beauport, concentrations of fecal
coliforms and enterococci are frequently above acceptable
limits.* On August 22nd, water samples were taken at eight
different sites within the competition area. Four were above
250 coliforms/100 ml (acceptable limit: 200/100 ml). Based on
hydrodynamic simulation fecal coliform density at high tide,
when most of the races were held, was estimated to be
1,000/100 ml.'
One hundred and sixty-four windsurfers took part in
various events during the nine days of the championship.
The exposed population consisted ofthe 84 competitors who
participated in the final windsurfing races on August 23rd,
and were thus exposed to polluted water for nine days. The
reference population consisted ofthe 41 employees scheduled to work at the racing site on August 23rd. During the
championship, the same single menu meals were served to
both competitors and employees.
On August 23rd, information about exposure to polluted
water and occurrence of health symptoms was obtained by
questionnaire from competitors and employees. Five comFrom the D6partement de M^decine sociaie et preventive. Faculty de

petitors did not complete the questionnaire. Occurrence of
symptoms was ascertained for two time periods: the two
months preceding the competitions, and the nine-day period
ofthe championship.
Cumulative incidence over the nine-day period was
measured among the 79 competitors and the 41 employees
respectively, for individual symptoms, all gastrointestinal
disorders, and overall symptomatology related to polluted
water exposure. Relative risk (RR) for each health outcome
was measured as the ratio of cumulative incidence among
windsurfers to that among employees.**' As adjustment for
age and sex did not change the risk estimates, only the crude
analysis is presented. Dose response was assessed by the
Mantel extension test for trend.'"
Results
Age and sex distributions were similar among competitors and employees. On average, competitors participated in
seven three-hour races and reported falling 18 times into the
water. Relative risks for polluted-water exposure-related
symptoms are presented in Table 1. Forty-five competitors
and eight employees reported at least one symptom associated with exposure to polluted water. The overall RR was
2.9 (95% confidence limits: 1.3-6,6). RR for gastrointestinal
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain)
was 5.5 (95% CL: 1.4-21.4). RRs for symptoms of skin
infection, otitis, and conjunctivitis were also elevated. There
was a regular trend in increase of risk with the number of
falls into the water (Table 2), Symptoms occurred in all the
10 competitors who fell more than 30 times. In contrast, only
44 per cent of those who fell 10 times or less were affected.

the baie de Beauport developed symptoms during the study
period. The RR for polluted-water exposure-related symptoms, calculated by comparing these 10 employees to the 31
unexposed employees, was 3.1 (95% CL: 0,7-14.3), Thirtysix competitors and 18 employees presented at least one
symptom unrelated to water pollution (RR = 1.0, 95% CL:
0,5-2.1).
Discussion
This study documented the increased risk for infectious
manifestations in subjects exposed to sewage-polluted water
while windsurfing. The risk was particularly high for symptoms of gastroenteritis and was above that documented
previously among swimmers."'^ This could be explained by
the high level of water pollution and repetitive contacts with
water during the nine days of the championship.
Eighty competitors did not participate in the final
events. No withdrawal was made for health reasons. Some
competitors were eliminated because they performed
poorly, which could have been a consequence of illness thus
underestimating the occurrence of infectious symptoms. The
RRs associated with polluted water exposure were furthermore underestimated as some employees were also exposed,
although to a lesser degree than competitors.
As competitors were not informed of the quality of the
water, information bias on adverse health effects was minimized. The health outcomes assessed in this study were not
clinically or microbiologically diagnosed. The induction time
for most symptoms is considered to be short (less than 48
hours). Of the 45 competitors who reported at least one
symptom related to polluted-water exposure, 17 did not
specify date of occurrence. Ofthe 28 who did, four reported
occurrence of symptoms during the first two days
(conjunctivitis three, skin rash one). We did not assess
occurrence of symptoms during the two days following the

AJPH June 1986, Vol. 76, No. 6

end ofthe competition. Thus, our risk estimates may be too
low. In addition, occurrence of water-borne infectious diseases with longer incubation periods, especially hepatitis,'^
was not investigated.
The observed association between exposure to polluted
water and symptoms of gastroenteritis could refiect the
infiuence of diet or stress. The effect of diet was controlled in
part since all subjects ate the same meals most of the time
throughout the study period and no difference was observed
in the frequency of digestive symptoms among windsurfers
coming from different areas. Windsurfers were more likely
than employees to experience stress, although, as experienced athletes, they would be familiar with the emotional
tension of competition.
We reported that water pollution exposes windsurfers
and swimmers to similar health hazards. Recreational
windsurfers are at even higher risk as they fall more often
than professionals. The same water quality criteria should
therefore be applied to all recreational activities in which
there is intentional, probable, or accidental direct contact
with water.
