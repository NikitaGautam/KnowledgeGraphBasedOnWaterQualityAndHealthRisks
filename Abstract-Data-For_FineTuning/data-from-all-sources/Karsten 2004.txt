Abstract In developed countries, acute gastroenteritis
(AGE) is a major source of morbidity. However, only a
few studies have estimated its incidence and the
associated medical burden. This population-based study
determined the incidence of community-acquired AGE
patients seeking medical care and the relative role of
various pathogens. Stool samples from patients with
AGE presenting to a general practitioner (GP), pediatrician, or specialist in internal medicine for that reason
were screened for various bacterial and viral enteropathC. Karsten : H.-I. Huppertz (*)

ogens. A control group was established as well.
Incidences were calculated by the number of positive
patients divided by the general population. The study
was performed in north-west Germany in 2004. The
incidence of AGE patients requiring medical consultation
was 4,020/100,000 inhabitants. Children (<5 years of
age) were at the highest risk (13,810/100,000 inhabitants). Of the patients, 6.6% were tested positive for an
enteropathogenic bacteria and 17.7% for a viral agent.
The predominant pathogens were norovirus (626/100,000)
and rotavirus (270/100,000). Salmonella was the most
frequently detected bacteria (162/100,000). The results
presented confirm AGE and, specifically, AGE of viral
origin as a major public health burden in developed
countries.

Introduction
Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) characterized by vomiting,
diarrhea, and dehydration is prevalent worldwide and is
associated with high rates of mortality in developing
countries [1, 2]. In more developed regions, AGE is a
frequent cause of hospitalization, especially in young
children [3].
Epidemiological studies from several European
countries provide data on the incidence of AGE, risk
factors, and the associated health burden [4–12]. German
studies focused on young children [13, 14], while data on
primary care consultations across all ages is lacking..
Findings are likely to differ between European countries
due to nutritional habits, health behavior of the population, and differently set up health services [4, 7, 8]. The
incidence of AGE cases presenting to general practice was
reported to be 800/100,000 inhabitants per year in The



936

Netherlands and 3,300/100,000 inhabitants per year in
England [4, 7]..
To reduce the incidence of AGE on a national and
European level, changes were made to cattle and poultry
breeding practices and the population was informed about
hygienic measures over the last two decades. These
measures significantly reduced the incidence of salmonellosis [15, 16] and most likely contributed to a shift in the
relative contribution of pathogens that are currently causing
AGE. Therefore, data demonstrating the relative importance
of different viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents in causing
AGE does need continuous updates since the distribution
and relative importance of pathogens are likely to change
over time. Moreover, the relevance of risk factors may be
subject to change as well.
Nowadays, viral AGE is more frequently acknowledged,
due partly to improved diagnostic methods and new virus
variants, e.g., norovirus subtypes showing epidemic spread,
as well as an increase in the number of outbreaks [17–19].
It has been acknowledged that persons may continue to
excrete an enteropathogen after an episode of AGE or may
even be an asymptomatic shedder without previous disease
[20, 21]. Asymptomatic carriers of viral or bacterial
pathogens may have epidemiological importance due to
their potency as a source of infection.
Various bacterial and viral enteropathogens are enclosed
in the German surveillance system. However, studies from
England and Ireland showed a systematic underreporting of
AGE in national surveillance systems [4, 10]. Incidences
derived from surveillance systems are likely to be smaller
than the incidences found in population-based studies.
The aims of the present study were to determine the
incidence of community-acquired AGE cases presenting to
general practice and to investigate the relative role of
various bacterial and viral pathogens. Secondary aims were
to identify risk factors for microorganism-specific AGE and
determine the occurrence of asymptomatic carriers of viral
or bacterial pathogens and multiple infections .

Methods
Study population
Between 1 January and 31 December 2004, all general
practitioners (GPs) and specialists in pediatrics and internal
medicine in an urban (suburbs of Bremen; 40,268 inhabitants) and rural area (Wesermarsch; 20,402 inhabitants) of
Germany were asked to send stool samples from all patients
presenting with AGE for laboratory investigation. In
Germany, patients have free choice as to whether they
consult a GP, pediatrician, or specialist in internal medicine.
Forty-seven out of 67 physicians (70%) registered in the

Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2009) 28:935–943

study area participated actively and continuously in the
study. The geographical and social conditions of these areas
were considered to be particularly suitable for an epidemiological study: the urban area is separated from the rest of
the city by the Weser River, while the rural area is limited
by the North Sea and the broadening Weser River on three
sides. It was expected that only very few patients would
consult a physician outside of these study areas due to the
special geographical conditions and accessibility of health
care services.
Diarrhea was defined as the excretion of at least two
loose and malodorous stools in breastfed infants and at least
two loose stools in a 24-h period for all other patients [22].
Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac
disease, cystic fibrosis, food intolerance, and malignancy
were excluded from participation, in addition to patients on
antibiotics or chemotherapy at the time of presentation.
To establish a control group, physicians were asked to
send stool specimens from patients living in the same study
areas who presented with symptoms other than diarrhea and
vomiting. Patients and controls were asked to complete a
questionnaire about their recent exposure to other people
with diarrhea or about the consumption of food including
poultry, unpasteurized milk, or other. In addition, we asked
for symptoms and the course of their illness.
Case data was de-duplicated to ensure that one individual case was not included twice after presentation to
different doctors.
All patients and controls or their parents or guardians
gave written informed consent for participation in this
study. The study protocol and data handling were approved
by the local ethics committee.
Microbiological methods
Stool specimens were analyzed for Campylobacter spp.,
Salmonella enterica serovars, Yersinia spp., Shigella spp.,
enterotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus (detection of
the marker genes sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej
[23, 24]), Clostridium difficile, Aeromonas spp., and
Plesiomonas spp. All specimens were analyzed as follows:
1 g of stool was plated on a combination of Columbia
blood agar, Endo agar, and selective agars (CIN agar for
Yersinia spp., Önöz and Leifson agar for Salmonella and
Shigella spp., Sorbitol-MacConkey [SMAC] and CTSMAC agar for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and
Charcoal Cefoperazon Deoxycholate agar [CCDA] and
selenite broth for the detection of Campylobacter spp.).
The CCDA and selenite broth were incubated in microaerophilic conditions and bacterial growth was detected as
described previously [25].
The detection of marker genes for enteropathogenic E.
coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterotoxic E.



Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2009) 28:935–943

coli (ETEC) [26], enteroaggregative E. coli (EaggEC) [27],
and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) was performed as
described previously [28].
Virus detection
Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used for the detection
of rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus. A total of 100 μl of
stool specimen was diluted in appropriate amounts of
sample buffer included in the commercial kit (DakoCytomation Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK). The IDEIA™ kit
detects group A rotaviruses, while the adenovirus EIA
detects all human adenovirus serotypes. The astrovirus EIA
works with a genus-specific combination of monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies and a special amplification
system.
Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for
the detection of noroviruses. A total of 50 μl of stool
specimen was diluted in 200 μl of phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). Viral RNA was extracted by the Purescript
Total RNA Isolation (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) and GI and GII norovirus was detected by nested RTPCR, as previously reported [29].
Statistics
Laboratory findings and responses from questionnaires
were entered into a Microsoft Access™ database. The data
were analyzed in Microsoft Excel™, where incidences,
95% confidence intervals (CI95), and odds ratios (OR) were
calculated. Pathogen-specific incidences were calculated by
the number of positive patients divided by the general
population. For the calculation of incidences, data were
taken from population census in Bremen and Lower
Saxony (http://www.nls.niedersachsen.de and Statistisches
Landesamt Bremen, data on file). The total population of
the catchment areas was diminished by that part of the
population served by the non-participating physicians.
Incidences were adjusted for age using direct standardization based on the German age distribution data for 2003
(http://www.destatis.de); for patients who lived in the study
area but consulted a physician elsewhere; and for patients
who refused to participate in this study. These data were
obtained from the local public health authorities (LPHA)
(Gesundheitsamt Bremen and Gesundheitsamt Wesermarsch, Brake, data on file). For the calculation of
rotavirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus incidences, it was
assumed that insufficient stool quantity with subsequent
non-examination of these viruses was independent of the
presence of these viruses. Hence, the expected number of
infections among the non-examined stool samples was
derived from the percentage of positive stool samples found
in the group of examined patients.

937

Logistic regression analysis was performed using SAS
System, Release 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to
determine the variables that were independently associated
with the risk of AGE. Variables were selected in a stepwise
backward manner (maximum likelihood), in which the least
significant variable was excluded at each step. The agentspecific morbidity was calculated as the percentage of
symptomatic patients out of the total number of study
participants positive for that agent.
Qualitative variables were compared by the χ2 test or
Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Significance was defined
as P<0.05 and high significance as P<0.001. The LPHA
also supplied data on the occurrence of clusters (i.e., two or
more cases of AGE caused by the same microbiological
agents), which were identified by telephone investigation—
laboratory tests were not requested. These additional cases
identified by the LPHA were not included in the calculation
of incidences and the analysis of risk factors.

Results
In total, 1,630 patients and controls were included in the
analyses. Of these, 1,463 (90%) returned a completed
questionnaire. A total of 1,086 specimens were collected
from patients with diarrhea, 639 in the urban area and 447
in the rural area. From the controls, 544 specimens were
collected, 338 specimens in the urban area and 206
specimens in the rural area. The sex and age distribution
of the study population is shown in Table 1.
Due to insufficient stool quantities, some samples could
not be tested for all viruses and bacteria. Out of 1,630 stool
specimens, 1,580 (96.9%) were tested for enteropathogenic
bacteria, 1,585 (97.2%) were tested for norovirus, and
1,338 (82.1%) were tested for all four viral agents (Table 2).

Incidence of gastroenteritis
The overall incidence of AGE requiring medical consultation was 4,020/100,000 inhabitants (CI95 [1,879; 6,687]),
with no significant difference between the urban and rural
areas.
Children younger than five years of age had the
highest incidence of AGE requiring medical consultation
(13,810/100,000; CI95 [6,819; 21,601]), which was significantly different from the rest of the population (P<
0.001, OR=3.88; CI95 [3.3; 4.6]). In this age group, one
out of six children consulted a physician due to AGE in
the urban area (15,967/100,000; CI95 [7,979; 24,691]), in
contrast to one out of ten children in the rural area
(10,791/100,000; CI95 [5,230; 17,368]). This difference
was significant (P=0.008, OR=1.57; CI95 [1.1; 2.2]).

Similarly, in people aged 60 years or older, there was a
highly significant difference in incidences between the
rural and urban areas (P<0.001, OR=2.41; CI95 [1.8; 3.2])
(Table 3).
In the urban area, the highest incidences of medical
consultations due to AGE were from October through to
December, whereas in the rural area, the highest incidences
were found in January, March, and April, which is
coincident with the different pathogen patterns between
the two areas
Incidence of specific viral and bacterial pathogens
A total of 80 out of 1,580 specimens tested positive for
enteropathogenic bacteria (72 patients, 6.6%, and eight
controls, 1.5%), while 320 out of 1,585 specimens tested
positive for a viral agent (280 patients, 17.7%, and 40
controls, 2.5%). Overall, viral and bacterial pathogens were
identified in 35% of specimens from patients with AGE
(Table 2). Months with high incidences of viral pathogens
revealed a higher portion of positive stool specimens than

months that showed lower incidences of viral pathogens
(Fig. 1).
Norovirus and rotavirus were the most frequently
detected pathogens. Norovirus was found in 16% of all
cases with AGE (Table 2). The incidence was 626/100,000
inhabitants (CI95 [287; 1,071]). Norovirus was detected
all-year-round, with two peaks. The months with the
highest incidences of norovirus infection were March and
December in the rural area and November and December
in the urban area. Morbidity for norovirus-related AGE
was 89.2%.
Rotavirus was responsible for 270 episodes/100,000
inhabitants (CI95 [124; 467]). The incidence of rotavirusrelated AGE in children younger than five years of age
(2,574/100,000, CI95 [1,193; 4,455]) was higher than that
for noroviruses in this age group (2,302/100,000, CI95
[1,065; 4,006]), thus, confirming that rotavirus is the most
important pathogen causing AGE in young children.
Rotavirus-related AGE occurred all-year-round, with a
distinctive seasonal peak in March and April. Morbidity
for rotavirus-related AGE was 84.1%.

Incidences of AGE due to astroviruses and adenoviruses
are shown in Table 2. Children younger than five years
were at the highest risk, but astroviruses were an important
agent for viral AGE in all age groups. Adenoviruses were
rarely detected in patients aged five years or older.
Salmonella was the most frequently detected bacteria
found in patients with AGE (162/100,000, CI95 [74; 290]),
followed by enterotoxin gene-carrying S. aureus (67/100,000,
CI95 [31; 120]) and Campylobacter spp. (55/100,000, CI95
[25; 101]). The age groups with the highest incidences of all
of these bacterial agents were children aged 0–14 years.
Salmonella infections showed a typical seasonal distribution,
prevailing between May and October. Salmonella and
Campylobacter spp. showed 100% morbidity.
Aeromonas spp. and Y. enterocolitica had comparable
incidences. Plesiomonas spp. and EPEC were found in one
and three cases, respectively (Table 2). EaggEC, EHEC,
EIEC, ETEC, or Shigella spp. were not isolated.
A total of 34 positive stool specimens from patients were
carrying two or more infectious agents (Table 4). In
controls, no co-infections were detected.
Table 5 shows the typical symptoms of AGE caused by
the various viral (frequently vomiting) and bacterial
(frequently fever) enteropathogens. Table 6 shows the risk
factors for acquiring AGE.

incidence of gastroenteritis
per 100000 inhabitants

This is the first population-based study presenting the
incidence of community-acquired AGE requiring medical

consultation across all age groups within defined areas over
a complete year. This study shows that AGE is a very
frequent disease, with children aged 0–4 years particularly
at risk. Viral and/or bacterial pathogens were detected in
35% of specimens from patients with AGE. Viral pathogens
were detected far more often than bacterial pathogens.
We believe that these results might be representative for
most of Germany and even other European countries.
Four percent of the study population consulted a
physician due to diarrhea in 2004 (4,020/100,000). This
incidence is higher than that reported by Wheeler et al. in
England (3,300/100,000 inhabitants) [4]. Furthermore, it is
almost five times higher than the incidence reported by de
Wit et al. in The Netherlands (800/100,000) [7]. It is
possible that the guidelines of the Dutch College of General
Practitioners (NHG)—which state that patients with an
uncomplicated case of AGE can be dealt with by phone
consultation (http://nhg.artsennet.nl)—may dissuade
patients from seeking medical assistance and, thus, explain
the low incidence of AGE found in The Netherlands.
Slightly different case definitions between the studies may
be another explanation for the varying incidences.
The incidence of AGE reported in this study proves it to
be a major public health burden and suggests that AGE
may have important cost implications for the healthcare
system. Information about the magnitude of the public
health burden of AGE is urgently needed in Germany.
Tam et al. [30] described risk factors associated with
presentation to a GP in patients with infectious intestinal
diseases. They suggest how these risk factors may introduce
selection bias when performing a case–control study using

this sub-set of patients only. GP presentation is associated
with biological factors, such as disease severity, and social
factors, such as educational level [30]. Some patients may
not have seen a physician in spite of severe AGE, and some
patients may have seen a physician in the presence of mild
AGE. Wheeler et al. described that the ratio of community
incidence to GP presentation incidence differs depending on
the pathogen. Patients infected by Salmonella spp. were
more likely to present to their GP than patients infected by
rota- or norovirus [4]. Therefore, it is likely that the relative
frequency of pathogens in patients may differ from the
relative frequency of pathogens in the community.
Viral and bacterial pathogens were identified in about
one third of the specimens. The proportion of positive
samples is in agreement with the findings of Sinclair et al.
and de Wit et al. [7, 8, 31]. There are several factors which
might explain why no causative agent was detected in the
remaining specimens. Organisms may have escaped detection due to the low numbers present in specimens, the delay
between the onset of symptoms and collection of specimens, transport loss due to overgrowth by physiological
stool flora, or better laboratory assays. In some cases,
patients may have been infected by enteropathogens that
were not included in the diagnostic scope—for instance, by
parasites or rare viruses. Finally, diarrhea may occur as a
symptom in non-infectious illnesses, although the majority
of which were excluded by the study design. Further
research is urgently needed to refine the methods used for
the efficient detection of known causative agents of AGE
and to discover as yet unknown pathogens.
Viral pathogens were detected more frequently than
bacterial pathogens. This finding was independent from
age, suggesting that viruses are the leading cause of AGE in
all age groups. This finding suggests that it is not
appropriate to perform diagnostic procedures on apparently
sporadic cases of AGE for bacterial pathogens only. Of
note, 34 stool specimens were tested positive for two or
more viral and/or bacterial pathogens. Based on the clinical
information available, it was not possible to determine if
one of the pathogens or a combination were responsible for
the diarrheal symptoms.
Rotavirus infections occurred significantly more often in
children aged five years or younger than in adults, while
norovirus infections occurred significantly more often in
people aged 60 years or older. These findings are most
likely explained by the fact that primary infection with
rotavirus confers protective immunity against symptomatic
rotavirus infection, with subsequent infections later in life
remaining asymptomatic or associated with milder symptoms [32]. Knowledge on immunity to norovirus is
incomplete [33, 34]. No vaccines against norovirus are
available yet, while two vaccines against rotavirus are
currently licensed in Europe [35–37]. Introducing a safe

941

and effective vaccine against rotavirus will most likely
reduce the morbidity and mortality of AGE considerably,
especially in young children.
A pathogen was detected in 48 samples from controls. In
these cases, viral pathogens were found more frequently
than bacterial pathogens. After an episode of AGE, patients
may continue to excrete the pathogen for variable periods.
Patients may even be asymptomatic shedders without
previous disease [20, 21]. de Wit et al. described asymptomatic carriers of rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and
astrovirus in healthy controls [7]. This can have epidemiological importance due to their capacity to act as a source
of infection, which is especially relevant for viral pathogens
with high tenacity, low infective dose, and predominant
person-to-person transmission. Asymptomatic shedders
may be important vectors of these viruses into healthcare
institutions, where the burden of outbreaks has risen over
recent years [38].
In this study, close contact with persons who experienced diarrhea within the previous ten days was an
important risk factor for acquiring viral AGE. This suggests
that many cases were not sporadic but were part of
outbreaks. For AGE, due to Salmonella and Campylobacter
spp. a significant risk factor was the consumption of certain
foods implicated by the patients.
Incidences of AGE caused by various viral and bacterial
pathogens found in this study were 2.5–10 times higher
than incidences based on reported cases within the German
surveillance system (http://www.rki.de). The reported incidence of norovirus in 2004 was 77.1/100,000 inhabitants
compared with 626/100,000 inhabitants in this study.
Findings for rotavirus (45.5 versus 270/100,000 inhabitants) and Salmonella (68.7 versus 162/100,000 inhabitants) confirmed the systematic underreporting in the
surveillance system. Reasons for this are summarized in
the concept of the AGE disease pyramid: only a fraction of
community cases of AGE seek medical care and only a
fraction of those will be requested to or will submit a stool
sample for testing. Furthermore, only a fraction of stool
samples will be tested positive for a causative agent, as has
been reported in other countries with national surveillance
systems [4, 10, 30, 39].
In conclusion, this population-based study on the
incidence of community-acquired AGE showed a high
disease burden and a marked underreporting of the disease
and demonstrated a significant predominance of viral AGE
throughout the year. This study leads the way for investigations to assess the full extent of AGE. Additional
studies on the disease burden should follow.
