Introduction

The link between adverse health outcomes and recreational
swimming and bathing has been well documented since the
1950s (Stevenson, 1953). During the last 30 years, associations
between faecal indicators and illness have been established for
beach swimmers (Prüss, 1998; Wade et al., 2003, 2006; Colford
et al., 2007) including the 1984 U.S. EPA study (Dufour, 1984)
that established Escherichia coli as a criteria indicator for faecal
contamination in freshwater (U.S. EPA, 1986).
Furthermore, the current U.S. recreational water quality
criteria for faecal indicators are scheduled for revision no later

than October 15, 2012 per a consent decree stemming from
Natural Resources Defense Council v. Stephen L. Johnson and
U.S. EPA (2008). At the present time, there is limited epidemiologic data for recreational water exposure from inland U.S.
waters with most of the research in the last twenty-six years
having focused on the Great Lakes (Wade et al., 2006; Wade
et al., 2008) and coastal marine waters (Wade et al., 2003).
Additionally, there has been limited published epidemiologic
research evaluating illness outcomes among users of inland
recreational waters.
Beyond epidemiologic studies, outbreak analysis provides
a basis for evaluating the public health threat and disease

burden. The evidence from reported outbreaks suggests the
majority of recreational waterborne diseases from untreated
water outbreaks are from untreated inland waters. In the most
recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) surveillance
report on recreational waters, inland waters contributed to 19
of the 20 (95%) U.S. recreational waterborne disease outbreaks
from non-Vibrio agents in untreated waters from 2005 to 2006
(Yoder et al., 2008). This finding has been observed in previous
CDC surveillance reports. For example in 2003e2004, all 19 of
19 outbreaks (100%) were from inland waters (Dziuban et al.,
2006). In 2001e2002, all 11 of 11 outbreaks from untreated
waters were non-coastal (Yoder et al., 2004). This evidence is
clear in indicating that U.S. non-coastal waters are a public
health
concern
warranting
focused
epidemiologic
investigation.
Prior to 2003, the three most notable freshwater epidemiology studies in the U.S. were Stevenson (1953), Dufour (1984)
and Calderon et al. (1991) as cited in Wade et al. (2003), with
5124, 21,777 and 144 participants, respectively. These studies
report associations between gastrointestinal (GI) illness and
water quality as indicated by faecal indicator bacteria; however,
these studies are few and were limited to few bodies of water.
In response to a growing number of arguments against the
use of enterococci and E. coli standards in the scientific literature, Wade et al. (2003) engaged in a comprehensive metaanalysis of the 27 most relevant epidemiologic studies, which
captured studies ranging from 247 to 26,686 participants. For
GI illness, the correlation coefficient was r ¼ 0.86 for the
natural log relative risk of GI illness as a function of E. coli
density. The Wade et al. (2003) study provided evidence in
support of the U.S. EPA’s position on using E. coli as a recreational water standard to reduce GI illness risk among freshwater contact recreation users. Despite good correlation
between E. coli density and GI illness risk, the correlation was
based solely upon three studies.
To contribute knowledge to the understudied issue
regarding illness risk among inland recreational water users,
we conducted a prospective cohort study. The primary goal of
this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of E. coli as an
indicator of GI illness risk among recreational water users at
East Fork Lake, Ohio, U.S.A. East Fork Lake, is a typical Midwestern U.S. flood-control reservoir used often for recreational activities. This study was designed to identify
differences in GI illness risks among swimmers and nonswimmers. By sampling over 26 days, the study design
allowed the exploration of GI illness risk for swimmers
exposed to various E. coli densities.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Overview of methods

Beach water samples and human health data were collected
from the public beach at East Fork State Park during the 2009
swimming season. The study design was a prospective cohort
design similar to that used by Wade et al. (2006) and Wade
et al. (2008). In brief, subjects were recruited from the beach
on the same day that water quality measurements including
E. coli were conducted. Subjects completed a survey at the

beach giving demographics and water-related behaviours (e.g.
wading, playing or swimming in water). Subjects were contacted eight to nine days later by phone to ascertain potential
water-related illness. The study design, questionnaires and
related materials were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at The Ohio State University (IRB
Protocol #2009H0107).

2.2.

Sampling site

Beach water sampling and the human health survey were
administered at the public beach at East Fork State Park (39 10
11.200 N; 84 10 2.800 W) over 26 weekend days starting May 30
and ending August 30, 2009. The 365 m public beach is located
along the lake, a human-made 8.7 km2 flood-control reservoir
providing numerous benefits to the Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A.,
metropolitan/suburban area including full-body contact
water recreation. Probable pollution sources for the reservoir
are primarily non-point, with dominant watershed land uses
being row crop agriculture (37%), light urban/residential (33%)
and forestland (25%) (East Fork Watershed Collaborative,
2006). Several small municipal wastewater treatment plants
are permitted to discharge into the lake tributaries; however,
no discharges are permitted directly into the reservoir. Failing
home sewage treatment systems have been identified as likely
faecal contamination sources for the lake tributaries and
reservoir (East Fork Watershed Collaborative, 2006).

2.3.

Recreational water samples

Samples were collected in accordance with the Ohio
Department of Health (2009) standard methods. In brief,
a single daily sample was collected using autoclaved 500 mL
Nalgene bottles or 500 mL sterile Whirl-Pakª bags in water of
approximately three feet in depth near the center of the 365 m
beach. The sample was gathered by sweeping the bottle or bag
one foot below the surface of the water. Scum and debris were
avoided in the sweeping process. From this single daily
sample collection at the beach, all of the analyses and
archiving were performed. Within-day sample times varied
from 10:50 to 20:25 although most samples (92%) were
collected within 4 h of the median sample time of 13:52.
Ancillary water measurements and weather observations
were made at the time of sampling. Daily precipitation and the
mean daily water inflow for the watershed of the reservoir
were provided for each sample collection day by the Louisville
District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (2010). All water
quality laboratory analyses were performed within 6 h of
sample collection. E. coli density was quantified using EPA
Method 1603 (U.S. EPA, 2002). Autoclaved deionised water was
used as a negative control. The colony counts were converted
to colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL after dividing by the
filtration volume.

2.4.

Administration of beach user questionnaire

The sampling approach was a cluster design that enrolled
households with a household member over 18 years old who
was using the East Fork beach and willing to speak on behalf of
their household. Subjects were recruited over 26 days across

13 weekends during the summer of 2009. Beachgoers were
invited into the study through signage and/or by being
approached by study personnel. The invitation for participation followed an approved standard script. The process of
consent was administered verbally to persons eligible to
consent. Upon receiving consent, households choosing to
engage in the full study participated in an initial interview at
the beach, a second interview when leaving the beach, and
follow-up phone interview 8e9 days after their visit.
The initial interview at the beach captured pertinent
enrolment information. This included the identification of
household members at the beach as well as phone numbers
for the follow-up telephone interview. In addition, information was collected concerning potentially confounding existing symptoms as well as age and sex. This initial interview
was completed with a gift and instructions for reporting for
second interview to occur before leaving the beach.
The second interview occurred at the end of their beach
stay and gathered household member-specific exposure data
including: time spent at the beach, time in the water, whether
the body or head were submerged, consumption of food at the
beach, and others. This second interview concluded with a gift
and information concerning the telephone interview followup survey.
The telephone interview was the third and final interview.
Using previously collected telephone numbers, the participants were contacted 8e9 days following their visit to the East
Fork beach. Respondents were asked about any new symptoms since their visit to the beach.
The survey instrument employed was a modified version
of the U.S. EPA questionnaire developed for the National
Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational Water (NEEAR) study. The full questionnaire has been
successfully employed by Wade et al. (2006), Wade et al. (2008)
and Heaney et al. (2009). Like the original NEEAR Beach
Questionnaire, our modified and reduced length questionnaire retained key questions to ascertain three types of
information: exposure status, illness status/symptoms, and
demographics. Across all three information domains, the
identified adult respondent (18 years of age) provided information for themselves and others within their household.
Information about exposure status included the amount of
time spent at the beach, as well as their activities including
the amount of time spent in the water, head immersion, and
others. Illness/symptom questions included a variety of
outcomes including GI symptoms, ear infection, skin rash or
skin infection. Demographic questions were limited to age,
gender and ethnicity. Ancillary information was collected
including distance travelled to visit the beach, frequency of
visits, and whether cost (i.e. no charge) was a factor in their
decision to visit the beach.

2.5.

Classification of beach exposures

To characterize beach exposures, dichotomous and categorical classifications were used. The dichotomous classifications
pertained to the identification of exposed (coded as “1”) versus
unexposed (“0”). The exposed swimmer group represented
respondents that reported to “wade, swim or play in the
water”; whereas, the unexposed group indicated no such

3

activity. An additional exposure of interest was the
consumption of food at the beach. Respondents reporting to
have “consume[d] food while at the beach” the day of the
survey were also dichotomously classified as “1” or “0”.
A categorical classification scheme was used to further
characterize the level of microbial exposure among the
swimmer group. The water quality parameter E. coli was used
for class coding. For the logistic regression model, the E. coli
classes were 0e3.3, 3.3e11.3, 11.3e59 and 59e1538 CFU/
100 mL. These values are the quartiles for the E. coli distribution of the beach water samples among the 806 swimmers.

2.6.

Classification of health outcomes

The data were explored to identify any reported illness, GI
illness and highly credible gastrointestinal illness (HCGI).
Symptoms including but not limited to fever, headache,
nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting were treated as dichotomous
variables, where individuals reporting a symptom were coded
as “1” for the symptom or “0” if no symptom was reported. GI
was defined using the definition established by Dufour (1984),
which includes any person reporting any of the following
symptoms: nausea, stomachache, diarrhoea or vomiting. GI
illness was treated as a dichotomous variable, where individuals with no new GI illness symptoms were coded as “0”
and persons with one or more new GI illness symptoms since
visiting the beach were coded as “1”. HCGI was defined using
the “HCGI-1” definition employed by Colford et al. (2007) and
nearly identical to the HCGI illness definition established by
Dufour (1984). Persons reporting to exhibit any of the
following conditions were coded as “1” for HCGI illness: (1)
vomiting; (2) diarrhoea and fever; (3) stomachache or nausea
accompanied with a fever.

2.7.

Data analysis

GI illness was initially explored by performing tabulations
with exposure and demographic data. Initial data analysis
focused on the occurrence of specific GI-related symptoms
among swimmers and non-swimmers. Further tabulations
were performed to compare the frequency of GI and HCGI
illnesses among swimmers and non-swimmers. GI and HCGI
illness frequencies were further explored across the four
levels of water quality as determined by the distribution of the
E. coli density quartiles. Additional tabulations for characterizing the frequency of GI-related symptoms among beach
users were performed taking into consideration age, sex and
other beach exposures such as food consumption.
Following initial data exploration, multivariable analysis
was employed. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk
of GI and HCGI illness via observed adjusted odds ratios. Models
were constructed to consider potential confounders and/or
modifying influences such as age and sex. Due to the clustering
of participants by household, the data were not considered to
be a simple random sample, but instead for the purposes of
statistical analysis, the data were treated as clustered by
household (Levy and Lemeshow, 1999). Model construction
involved the identification of biologically plausible covariates
coupled with statistical selection. A reverse stepwise procedure
was used in model 3 to select variables with some likely

association ( p < 0.15; Bendel and Afifi (1977)) with GI and HCGI
illness. Model 3 estimates adjusted odds ratios for swimmers
across the four E. coli density levels.
Ultimately, three adjusted logistic regression models were
constructed. The first model (model 1) estimated GI illness risk
for swimmers, where swimmers are those who reported
wading, playing or swimming in the water. This model used
non-swimmers as the reference group and adjusted for only
age, gender and the reservoir inflow. With concerns that age
and flow were not likely to be linear in the logit for GI and HCGI
illness outcomes, age was categorized into six groups that could
be classified as young child, older child, teenager, young adult,
adult and older adult. Reservoir inflow was categorized using
the terciles of exposure for the respondents. The consumption
of food at the beach and varying levels of E. coli were not
included in this model, despite being associated with the illness
outcomes. The second model (model 2) estimates GI and HCGI
illness risk for persons who consumed food at the beach. Model
2 was constructed similar to model 1, with adjustments being
made for only age, gender and reservoir inflow. Model 2 did not
differentiate swimmers from non-swimmers and did not
account for E. coli density, albeit associated with GI illness. The
third model (model 3) is the most complex. Model 3 only
included swimmers and was developed to determine GI and
HCGI illness risk among swimmers in waters with various
densities of E. coli. Model 3 only included age, gender and the
statistically-associated covariates ( p < 0.15). The dichotomous
variable regarding food consumption at the beach and the
categorical variable for the 48 h reservoir inflow were both
included due to their level of association with GI and HCGI
illness in this model. For all models, an adjusted odds ratio
(AOR) not including 1.0 in the 95% CI of the AOR was considered
significant, where p < 0.05. The performance of each of the
models was evaluated based on fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000)) and an analysis
of model sensitivity/specificity. Model sensitivity/specificity
was assessed by interpreting the area under the receiveroperating-characteristic (ROC) curve (Metz, 1978).
Linear regression procedures were also employed to identify the strength of association between GI illness and E. coli
density. Linear regression and Pearson correlation analysis
was performed as in Dufour (1984) to permit comparison with
previous epidemiologic data. Using this methodology, E. coli
(CFU/100 mL) was plotted on a log scale versus GI and HCGI
illness per 1000 individuals. Three dates containing less than
10 total observations from swimmers were excluded due to
their small sample size and large standardized residual.
Additionally, three of the remaining 23 sampling dates had
mean E. coli densities less than 1 CFU/100 mL and were converted to 1 CFU/100 mL. Pearson correlations were determined
to be significant if p < 0.05.
Associations between illness rates (GI and HCGI) and E. coli
density were also evaluated for trend. The CochraneArmitage
Test was employed where GI and HCGI illness rates were on an
ordinal scale from lowest mean daily E. coli density to highest.
Trends were determined using the CochraneArmitage Test
for Trend where a p < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant
trend in the observed data.
Initial tabulations, logistic regression modelling, assessing
logistic model fit, and the CochraneArmitage Test for Trend

were performed with Stata 11 (Stata Corporation, College
Station, TX, USA). Linear regression modelling and Pearson
correlation analysis were performed using Minitab 15 (Minitab
Inc., State College, PA, USA).

Results

3.1.

Enrolment

A total of 682 households consented and completed the initial
beach survey. Of these households, 554 returned to complete
the beach exit interview. Of those completing the beach exit
survey, 300 households were successfully contacted and
completed the follow-up phone survey for an overall household study retention rate of 44%. Accordingly, results are
presented for the 300 households and 965 individuals who
were living at the household for the entire follow-up period.
Demographic characteristics of this group are provided in
Table 1. Our sample was predominantly white (93%), and
travelled less than 40 miles to visit the beach (81%).

3.2.

Characterization of beach water quality

A total of 26 water samples were collected over 13 weekends
and all were successfully analyzed. The beach was open and
occupied over the 26-day sampling period. For two of the 26
sample days, E. coli densities exceeded the advisory threshold
of 235 CFU/100 mL. For these days, densities of 1538 CFU/
100 mL and 487 CFU/100 mL were detected, representing the
highest observed values (Table 2). These two high densities
were observed during the same weekend and followed 6.7 cm
of rainfall the day before the first observation. E. coli densities
remained above advisory conditions for a second day even

with no additional rainfall. Tributary inflows of 214 m3/s and
18.2 m3/s respectively, were observed on these two sample
days. The largest 24 h inflow volume reported during the entire
study period was 214 m3/s. Median inflow for this reservoir
during the sampling period was 1.5 m3/s. Beach water E. coli
densities were generally low, as illustrated by a median value
of 9.1 CFU/100 mL.

Characterizing exposures of beach users

Characteristics of individuals completing the survey with
respect to both demographics and exposure activities are
provided in Table 3. These data indicate that males and
females were similar in their behaviours to wade, play or
swim in the water (80 vs. 77%), but females were more likely to
consume food at the beach (64 vs. 57%). The youngest age
group (0e5 years) was most likely to consume food at the
beach with 64% of group members having this exposure.
Additionally, 90% of the youngest age group members had
beach water exposure. The older children (6e11 years) and the
adolescent/teenager group (12e18 years) had the most reported exposure to the water; whereby 98% of 6e11 year olds and
93% of 12e18 year olds reported to wade, play or swim. The
senior age group (56.0e73.9 years) reported the least
frequency for food consumption (38%), and wading, playing or
swimming in the water (41%).

Characterizing illness among beach users

Of the 965 individuals included in our sample, there were 109
cases (11.3%) of reported total illness. Of these, 48 (44%) were GIrelated. The partitioning of these adverse health outcomes
across demographic and exposure factors are presented in
Tables 3e5. Table 3 illustrates that GI illness incidence was
similar among males and females; however, the youngest age
group had the highest incidence of GI illness. Among the
exposure activities, Table 4 demonstrates the group not exposed
to water reported 3 (1.9%) cases. Only swimmers in the lowest E.
coli density exposure group reported less GI illness (1.1%),
although no statistical difference exists between these groups.
GI illness proportions were significantly higher for swimmers in
the two highest E. coli density groups, and in these two groups
over 8% of swimmers reported GI illness. Stomachaches, diarrhoea, and HCGI illness were also reported more frequently in
these highest two groups.

3.5.

GI illness risk estimates for beach users

Using logistic regression, we developed three models to evaluate predictors for GI and HCGI illness risk among East Fork
beach users. Table 5 provides the adjusted odds ratios (AOR)
for three models. The results of model 1, adjusted for age, sex
and reservoir inflow, demonstrated a significant AOR for
persons who reported wading, swimming or playing in the
water (AOR ¼ 3.2; CI: 1.1, 9.0) suggesting a 3.2-fold increased
odds for GI illness among those who went in the water. The
AOR for HCGI was not determined as the non-swimmer
reference group reported no HCGI cases. Model 2, adjusted for
age, sex and reservoir inflow, demonstrated increased odds
for GI illness (AOR ¼ 3.6; CI: 1.4, 9.9) and HCGI illness
(AOR ¼ 7.2; CI: 1.1e48) for persons reporting to have consumed
food while at the beach.
Model 3, which only estimates GI and HCGI illness risk
among persons who had contact with the water, demonstrated significant GI illness risk estimates for persons
exposed to the highest E. coli levels. After adjusting for age,
sex, reservoir inflow, and consuming food at the beach,
exposure to beach waters in the second highest E. coli quartile
(>11.3e59 CFU/100 mL) presented a significant elevated odds
ratio for GI illness (AOR ¼ 7.2; CI: 1.3, 39), but not for HCGI
illness (AOR ¼ 6.0; CI: 0.54, 71). Likewise, the highest E. coli
quartile (>59e1551 CFU/100 mL) presented similar findings for
GI (AOR ¼ 7.0; CI: 1.5, 32) and HCGI illness (AOR ¼ 3.7; CI:
0.63e77). Although statistical significance was not achieved in
the odds ratios for HCGI illness in these two highest E. coli

density classes, the respective p-values ( p ¼ 0.152 and
p ¼ 0.287) demonstrate that the direction of an association, if it
exists, is towards increased odds of HCGI illness. Similarly, for
the lowest E. coli density class (>3.3e11.3 CFU/100 mL) above
the reference group (0.1e3.3 CFU/100 mL), the adjusted odds
ratio did not achieve statistical significance ( p ¼ 0.204);
however, the likely direction of the association, if one exists, is
towards increased odds of GI illness.

Assessing performance of models and trends

The three logistic regression models constructed to predict GI
and HCGI illness vary in performance with respect to sensitivity and specificity as indicated by the ROC curve. Using the
area under the ROC curve (AUC), the value for the GI illness
model in model 1 is 0.63 (Table 6). Since the AUC value is below
0.70, we conclude the model does not provide acceptable
discrimination (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). The models
used to estimate GI and HCGI risks in model 2 provide better

discrimination as indicated by AUC values of 0.69 and 0.76,
respectively. The AUC value of 0.76 provides acceptable
discrimination. The most discriminatory models are the GI
and HCGI illness risk models labelled as model 3 in Table 6.
The AUC value of 0.72 in the GI illness risk model provides fair
or acceptable discrimination; however, the AUC value of 0.81
in the HCGI illness risk model provides good discrimination.
Additionally, when assessing the fit of each model, all of the
p-values are greater than 0.05 when using the HosmerLemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test. These p-values from the
goodness-of-fit test suggest that the probabilities estimated by
the model are an accurate representation of the true disease
experienced in the data.
Significant trends were observed in the data. The
CochraneArmitage Test for Trend demonstrated a significant
ordinal trend among swimmers for GI illness ( p ¼ 0.0016) and
HCGI illness ( p ¼ 0.0151) with increasing E. coli densities.
Furthermore, the continuous E. coli data plotted on a logscale
demonstrates a positive association with increasing

Discussion

The study showed increased GI illness risk among swimmers
when compared to non-swimmers, consistent with inland
(Stevenson, 1953; Dufour, 1984; Wade et al., 2006) and marine
beach studies (Cabelli et al., 1979; Colford et al., 2007).
Furthermore, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of

E. coli as a faecal indicator for determining GI illness risk
among swimmers at the study beach. The association of GI
illness and the results of the single daily faecal indicator
measurement is an important finding that compliments the
results of Wade et al. (2006), in which a single rapid Enterococcus measurement collected in the morning was useful for
determining GI illness risk among swimmers.
This prospective cohort study demonstrated an association between contact recreation with beach water and illness.
Overall, swimmers were more likely to report experiencing
symptoms than non-swimmers, a finding consistent with
Dufour (1984) and Fleisher et al. (1996). Like Dufour (1984), GI
symptoms were the most frequently reported. The observed
GI illness incidence of 56 cases per 1000 among swimmers is
comparable to the inland reservoir beach study results from
Dufour (1984) where the range of GI illness incidence over the
two-year study period was 37.9e61 cases per 1000 swimmers.
Non-swimmers at the inland reservoir studied by Dufour
(1984) exhibited a range in GI illness of 19e53 cases per
1000; whereas, East Fork non-swimmers experienced 19 GI
cases per 1000. Similarly, the proportions of swimmers
reporting HCGI illness were comparable. Overall, the rates of
GI illness in this study are comparable to previously reported
results from the largest epidemiologic study of inland U.S.
beaches.
The increased risk of GI illness was also observed to be
associated with persons reporting to have consumed food at
the beach. This variable was identified through reverse
selection when constructing the logistic regression model and
presumed to be a variable that serves as a proxy for duration
of exposure at the beach while taking into account confounding food-related illnesses.
The logistic regression models constructed demonstrate
significant associations with GI and HCGI illness (Table 5);
however, only after taking into account the E. coli densities
does the model achieve acceptable model sensitivity and
specificity (AUC > 0.70). Table 6 shows that the best performing model is model 3 when the outcome variable is HCGI
(AUC ¼ 0.81). This result, in which the HCGI illness model
outperformed the GI illness outcome model, is consistent
with the results of Dufour (1984). The most plausible reason

is the unmistakeable nature of HCGI illness versus more
subjective GI symptoms, which enables improved classification of the truly ill. A all three models provided an accurate
representation of the reported disease as demonstrated by
the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test (Table 6). Model
3, however, has a p-value near 0.05 for GI outcome suggesting
less than an ideal fit and may indicate that an alternative
model may produce a better representation of the true
disease. In contrast, the more well-defined HCGI outcome for
model 3, suggests a very accurate representation of the
reported disease.
The observations of increasing GI and HCGI illness incidence in the higher E. coli density exposure groups when
compared with swimmers exposed to the least E. coli suggest
that with increasing E. coli density, the risk for GI and HCGI
illness increases. These results are confirmed by significant
AORs when GI illness is the outcome of interest. The HCGI
illness outcome was unable to achieve significance, likely as an
artefact of the small sample size and relatively constant and
favourable water quality. Our models are all limited in that the
sample size is small and potentially confounding variables,
such as additional recreational water exposures, were not able
to be considered due to the abbreviated questionnaire administered. Despite these limitations, using swimmers exposed to
the lowest E. coli level as a reference group, the assumption is
that exposures away from the beach would be similar across all
swimmers, regardless of the day they selected to swim at the
study lake. Additionally, linear regression analysis of swimmers demonstrated a significant positive correlation between
GI and HCGI incidence with increasing E. coli density (Table 7).
This strength of association was further upheld for both GI and
HCGI incidence in trend tests.
Given the limited resources, we were only able to collect
a single water quality sample per day. The time of sample
collection was not consistent throughout the day, but was still
able to produce a significant association with GI and HCGI
illness. It has been determined that tremendous variability can
exist in water quality at selected marine beaches (Boehm et al.,
2002); however, in this study, we were able to estimate GI
illness risk using a single daily sample. These results may not
be able to be generalised to reservoirs with different watershed
dynamics or pollution sources; however, this study lake had
stable reservoir inflows and precipitation during the days in
which participants were enrolled. Additional E. coli measurements are not available to challenge our assumption that E. coli
densities were stable throughout our individual study days.
Lastly, this study reaffirmed the problem of not having
a rapid tool available to prevent exposure to recreational
waters when infectious disease risk is great enough to warrant
an advisory, as recreational water users were unknowingly

exposed to advisory conditions on two occasions. The sample
day with the peak reservoir inflow was associated with beach
user exposures to waters with E. coli densities exceeding
1500 CFU/100 mL. Despite having limited data regarding water
quality and reservoir inflows at this reservoir, it appears that
predictive modelling of E. coli at this reservoir offers an
opportunity to inform recreational water users in advance of
advisory events in an approach similar to Francy et al. (2003).
Predictive modelling efforts of E. coli are underway at this
reservoir. Future studies using archived filter membranes from
the study period are being planned to enable quantification of
alternative indicators using rapid molecular techniques.

Conclusions

 Beach users who reported wading, swimming or playing
in the water at this inland beach were at greater risk for GI
illness than persons who did not report these behaviours.
 The risk of GI illness increased among swimmers exposed to
increasing densities of the faecal indicator bacteria, E. coli.
 A single E. coli sample per day was effective at estimating
infectious disease risk at our study beach and may be an
acceptable approach at similar inland lake beaches.
 The membrane filtration method for E. coli quantification
continues to be inadequate in providing beach users with
timely information regarding infectious disease risk, and
rapid or predictive tools are warranted.
