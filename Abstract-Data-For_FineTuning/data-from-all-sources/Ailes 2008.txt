Abstract
Campylobacter is a leading cause of foodborne illness worldwide. In the United States, changes in the incidence
of culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections have been monitored by the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) since 1996. In 2006, the incidence of culture-confirmed Campylobacter infection in
the FoodNet sites was 12.7 per 100,000 persons. This represents a 30% decline (95% confidence ¼ 35% to 24%
decrease) compared to the 1996–1998 illness baseline; however, most of the decline occurred between 1996
and 1999 and the incidence still remains above the national health objective. Important declines were observed
in four FoodNet sites (California, Connecticut, Georgia, and Maryland), all age groups, and both sexes. To
promote continued progress towards achieving the national health objective, the epidemiology of Campylobacter infections in the United States, including geographic variation and higher incidence among the very
young, warrants further study.

Introduction

C

ampylobacter is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne illness worldwide and in
the United States, where it is estimated to cause
2 million illness each year (Samuel et al., 2004).
While most infections result in mild to moderate illness, severe illness and complications such
as Guillain-Barré syndrome and reactive arthritis can develop (Nachamkin 2002; SchmidtOtt et al., 2006). Although Campylobacter out-

breaks do occur, most infections are sporadic. The major risk factors for sporadic Campylobacter infection identified in the United
States include the consumption of chicken or
other nonpoultry meat prepared at a restaurant and foreign travel (Friedman et al., 2004).
Other sources of infection include unpasteurized milk, contaminated water, and contact
with farm animals, dogs, and cats (Hopkins
et al., 1984; Friedman et al., 2004; Ethelberg et al.,
2005).

Sentinel surveillance for culture-confirmed
Campylobacter infections was introduced in
the United States in 1996 as part of the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network
(FoodNet) of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) (Scallan, 2007). Campylobacter infections are not nationally notifiable
in the United States, and before the establishment of FoodNet, there were no precise estimates of the human health burden of this
important pathogen. In 2000, a national health
objective was established for a 50% reduction
in the 1997 incidence of Campylobacter infections by 2010 (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2000). FoodNet data continue
to track progress towards this ‘‘Healthy People’’ 2010 objective by comparing the crude
incidence in a given year to the crude incidence
in 1997. The purpose of this paper is to describe
changes in incidence of culture-confirmed
Campylobacter infections in the FoodNet sites
from 1996 to 2006 and assess progress towards
the national health objective of fewer than 12.3
culture-confirmed cases per 100,000 persons by
2010.
Materials and Methods

FoodNet is a collaborative project among
participating state health departments, the
CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) (Allos et al., 2004). From 1996 to 2006, the
FoodNet surveillance population increased
from 14.2 million persons (5% of the U.S. population) in five states to 45.5 million persons
(15% of the U.S. population) in 10 states. The
2006 FoodNet surveillance area includes Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New
Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and selected counties in California, Colorado, and New York.
FoodNet sites conduct active, population-based
surveillance for culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections by routinely contacting >650
clinical diagnostic laboratories receiving stool
and other specimens from residents of the 10
FoodNet sites. Demographic information and
patient outcome are collected and electronically
transmitted monthly to the CDC.

AILES ET AL.

Data analysis

We examined the incidence of cultureconfirmed Campylobacter infections by year of
specimen collection and patient sex, age, and
state of residence. Crude (unadjusted) annual
incidence rates were calculated by dividing
the number of culture-confirmed Campylobacter
cases in a given category by its corresponding
population for that year (U.S. Census Bureau,
2006). Season was assigned by specimen collection date: winter (December to February),
spring (March to May), summer ( June to
August), and fall (September to November).
A main-effects, log-linear Poisson regression
model (negative binomial) was used to estimate
changes in the incidence of Campylobacter in
FoodNet site and to calculate adjusted (modeled) incidence rates. This model accounted
for the increase in the number of FoodNet
sites and the surveillance population from
1996 to 2006 and for variation in the incidence
of infection among sites (Scallan, 2007). In order to increase the stability and precision of
our estimates, we choose the first 3 years of
FoodNet surveillance (1996–1998) as our baseline period for comparison (CDC, 2005a). The
estimated percent change in incidence (incidence rate ratio) between this baseline period
of 1996–1998 and 2006 was calculated with
95% confidence intervals (CI). To determine
whether changes in incidence were similar
across various factors, we also stratified our
analysis by FoodNet site, season of specimen
collection, and patient sex and age group.
Analyses were performed using SAS (Cary, NC)
version 9.1.
Results

From 1996 to 2006, there were 52,124 cultureconfirmed cases of Campylobacter infection ascertained in FoodNet. Of these, 50,469 (97%)
isolates were from stool, 605 (1%) were from an
unknown source, 550 (1%) were from other
sources such as urine or wounds, and 500 (1%)
were invasive infections. Of the 500 invasive
infections, 495 (99%) were from blood and 2
(<1%) were from cerebrospinal fluid. Of all
culture-confirmed cases, 6,288 (12%) were hospitalized and 57 died (<1%).



CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS, FOODNET 1996–2006

After adjusting for calendar year and changes
in the surveillance area, the average annual
incidence of Campylobacter was 13.9 per 100,000
persons, ranging from 34.0 per 100,000 in California to 6.8 per 100,000 in Maryland (Table 1).
The median age of persons with cultureconfirmed Campylobacter infection was 34 years
(interquartile range: 18–49 years). The incidence
of infection was highest in children <5 years old
at 26.1 per 100,000 (Table 1, Fig. 1). The incidence of infection was lowest in persons 5–19
years of age (Fig. 1). Culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections were more common among
males; the average annual incidence was 15.1
per 100,000 men compared to 12.6 per 100,000
women. Males had a higher incidence of infection than females across all age groups and
years (Table 1, Fig. 1). By season, the highest
incidence rate occurred in the summer, and

331

peak in incidence generally occurred in July
(Table 1, Fig. 2).
Changes in incidence from baseline to 2006

The incidence of culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections in FoodNet sites declined by
30% (95% confidence interval ¼ 35% to 24%
decrease) in 2006 when compared to the 1996–
1998 baseline (Table 1). Most of the decline occurred from baseline to 1999 (22% decrease, 95%
CI ¼ 28% to 15% decrease); there was a more
moderate 11% decrease between 1999 and 2006
(95% CI ¼ 18% to 2% decrease) (Fig. 3).
While the decline in incidence of Campylobacter infections was observed in seven of the
10 FoodNet sites, marked changes in the incidence were observed only in Georgia (55%
decrease, 95% CI ¼ 61% to 47% decrease), Cali-

Declines in incidence between baseline and
2006 were observed across all seasons. Summer
showed the greatest decline of 35% (95% CI:
41% to 28% decrease) with the smallest decline
occurring in winter (19% decline; 95% CI: 28% to
9% decline) (Table 1).
Discussion

The incidence of culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections declined in FoodNet from 1996
to 2006, indicating progress towards meeting
the national goal of a 50% reduction in incidence
from 1997 to 2010. Most of the decline, however,
occurred within the first 4 years of surveillance.
Declines in Campylobacter incidence were observed in all age groups, sexes, and seasons. The
variation in incidence across FoodNet sites
was notable, with California reporting an average incidence five times greater than that of
Maryland.
Compared to many other countries, the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the United States
is low. For example, the incidence of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand has been increasing
since the early 1980s and general practitioners
notified almost 400 cases per 100,000 persons in
2003 (Baker et al., 2007). Australia reported a
rate 10-fold higher than in the United States
in 2005, with >120 cases per 100,000 persons
(OzFoodNet Working Group, 2006). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
reported lower rates of 45 per 100,000 persons
in 2005; however, these rates still exceed the
highest rate reported by the California FoodNet
site in the United States. Canada has reported
decreasing rates since 1995; the rate in 2004 was
30 cases per 100,000 (Galanis, 2007). The variations in incidence between countries may be due
to in part to differences in surveillance systems
and the number of Campylobacter cases captured in surveillance. For example, in the United
States, there are an estimated 34 cases in the
community for every case of campylobacteriosis
in surveillance (Samuel et al., 2004), while in the
United Kingdom, there are an estimated seven
cases in the community for every case in surveillance (Wheeler et al., 1999).
Efforts by the food industry and food safety
regulators to control bacterial contamination of
meat products may have contributed to the

AILES ET AL.

decrease in the incidence of Campylobacter infections in FoodNet sites. In 1996, FSIS began
implementation of the Pathogen Reduction:
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point
System. This program requires that meat and
poultry companies increase efforts to sanitize
plants, conduct microbiological testing for Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157, implement
quality controls, and create standards to help
meet the performance standards for the prevalence of Salmonella permitted on meat products
(FSIS and USDA, 1996; Rose et al., 2002). Although these measures were aimed at Salmonella
and E. coli O157, they may also have resulted
in a decrease of Campylobacter contamination.
Changes in the type of Campylobacter strains on
chicken or other meat products may also affect
the incidence of human infections (Gormley
et al., 2008).
Declines in the incidence of Campylobacter
were most pronounced in four of the FoodNet
sites (California, Connecticut, Georgia, and
Maryland). No significant changes in incidence
were observed in the other six FoodNet sites,
although three (Colorado, New Mexico, and
Tennessee) showed nonsignificant increases
in incidence. In addition, differences in the incidence of Campylobacter infection between
FoodNet sites were sustained throughout the
surveillance period. Current studies in FoodNet
are examining whether quantitative differences
in the amount of Campylobacter on poultry exist
between FoodNet sites as well as whether clinical diagnostic laboratories perform testing for
Campylobacter in a similar manner across FoodNet sites.
A possible explanation for site-to-site variation in incidence is surveillance artifacts which
are those factors that result in a case failing to be
reported to public health (medical care-seeking
behavior, stool sample submission, or clinical
laboratory practices). To evaluate the potential
for under-reporting, FoodNet conducts crosssectional telephone surveys of residents of the
FoodNet catchment areas to assess healthseeking behaviors (FoodNet Population Survey)
and surveys of the clinical laboratories serving
the FoodNet catchment area. The FoodNet Population Surveys from 1996 to 2003 showed no
significant site-to-site variation in the frequency
of seeking medical care or stool sample sub-

mission among persons with diarrheal illness
( Jones et al., 2007). Likewise, 97% of clinical
laboratories serving the FoodNet sites reported
routine culturing of stool specimens for Campylobacter; this proportion did not vary significantly by site (Voetsch et al., 2004).
Another possible explanation for site-to-site
variation in incidence is site-to-site variation in
human Campylobacter infections due to the differences in the pathogen load of chicken (which
is a major source of Campylobacter infection in
the United States) (Tauxe et al., 1988; Friedman
et al., 2004; Fullerton et al., 2007). A survey of
meat samples purchased in grocery stores in
FoodNet sites in 2004 suggested little differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter on
chicken by FoodNet site, but did not measure
pathogen load on contaminated chicken (U.S.
Food and Drug Administration and Center
for Veterinary Medicine, 2006). Freezing practices can contribute to differences in pathogen
load since freezing results in a 2-log reduction
in Campylobacter (Sandberg et al., 2005). Consumption of fresh (unfrozen) chicken has
been shown to be a stronger risk factor for
Campylobacter infection than consumption of
previously frozen meat (Studahl and Andersson, 2000).
Despite declines, the incidence of Campylobacter continues to be high in children and infants <5 years of age. A recent case–control
study conducted in FoodNet sites found that
risk factors for infection in infants included
drinking well water, visiting or living on a farm,
and having exposure to pets with diarrhea
(Fullerton et al., 2007). This study also showed
an association between Campylobacter infection
among infants <6 months of age and riding in a
shopping cart next to meat or poultry.
The incidence of Campylobacter infections in
males is higher than in females, a finding which
has been observed in other countries (Thompson et al., 1986). Other pathogens monitored by
FoodNet do not show a similar pattern in incidence by sex, suggesting that there may be sexspecific risk factors for Campylobacter infection
that result in greater illness among males (CDC,
2005b). Further studies to elucidate sex-specific
risk exposures and behaviors for infection are
necessary to address this finding. Seasonal
fluctuations in incidence occurred and have

335

been observed in other countries as well (Nylen
et al., 2002; Louis et al., 2005). The peak incidence in summer may relate to the seasonal
fluctuations of Campylobacter on chicken farms,
and has been postulated to be related to changes
in human behavior, such as an increase in outdoor grilling, leading to a greater risk for exposure to undercooked poultry (Samuel et al.,
2004).
Extrapolation of FoodNet data nationally
requires the assumption that FoodNet sites
are geographically representative of the United
States. Previous analyses have shown FoodNet
sites to be comparable to the rest of the country
except for the proportion with Hispanic ethnicity (Hardnett et al., 2004). A limitation of this
study is that we were unable to explore changes
in incidence by different Campylobacter species
but efforts are currently underway in FoodNet
to collect this information. Despite this, the analyses presented here provide the best estimate
of the epidemiology of Campylobacter in the
United States and provide a stable and robust
means of monitoring progress toward national
health objectives.
Conclusions

The incidence of culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections decreased from 1996 to 2006.
These declines were observed in four states, all
age groups, and for both sexes. However, the
majority of this decline occurred from 1996
to 1999 and the incidence of Campylobacter remains above the national health objective. To
promote continued progress towards achieving
the national health objective, the epidemiology
of Campylobacter infections in the United States,
including geographic variation and higher incidence among the very young and in males,
warrants further study. The continued high incidence of Campylobacter infection reinforces the
need for further prevention efforts to meet that
national health goal.
