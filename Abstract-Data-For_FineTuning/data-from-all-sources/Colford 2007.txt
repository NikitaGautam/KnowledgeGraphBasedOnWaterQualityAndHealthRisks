Background: Indicator bacteria are a good predictor of illness at
marine beaches that have point sources of pollution with human
fecal content. Few studies have addressed the utility of indicator
bacteria where nonpoint sources are the dominant fecal input.
Extrapolating current water-quality thresholds to such locations is
uncertain.
Methods: In a cohort of 8797 beachgoers at Mission Bay, California, we measured baseline health at the time of exposure and 2
weeks later. Water samples were analyzed for bacterial indicators
(enterococcus, fecal coliforms, total coliforms) using both traditional and nontraditional methods, ie, chromogenic substrate or
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A novel bacterial indicator
(Bacteroides) and viruses (coliphage, adenovirus, norovirus) also
were measured. Associations of 14 health outcomes with both water
exposure and water quality indicators were assessed.
Results: Diarrhea and skin rash incidence were the only symptoms
that were increased in swimmers compared with nonswimmers. The
incidence of illness was not associated with any of the indicators that
traditionally are used to monitor beaches. Among nontraditional
water quality indicators, associations with illness were observed
only for male-specific coliphage, although a low number of participants were exposed to water at times when coliphage was detected.
Conclusions: Traditional fecal indicators currently used to monitor
these beaches were not associated with health risks. These results
suggest a need for alternative indicators of water quality where
nonpoint sources are dominant fecal contributors.

ecal indicator bacteria are monitored at marine recreational bathing beaches to assess the risk of swimmingrelated illnesses. In southern California, more than 85,000
samples are collected and $3 million is spent annually to
assess this public health risk.1 The focus on bacteria as a
public health monitoring tool is based on the relationship
between the density of fecal indicator bacteria and the occurrence of illnesses among persons with water exposure.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship
between fecal indicator bacteria at marine beaches and swimming-related illnesses.2,3 Cabelli et al4,5 reported a relationship between enterococcus and illness at several beaches.
Haile et al6 reported an association between enterococcus,
fecal, and total coliforms and swimming-related illnesses in
Santa Monica Bay, California. These studies contributed to
the establishment of water-quality thresholds at marine
beaches using fecal indicator bacteria.
Although previous studies demonstrated the value of
fecal indicator bacteria, virtually all were conducted at locations at which human sewage was the predominant contamination source. Only the study by Haile et al6 focused on
urban runoff as a source, but even this nonpoint source was
known to contain nearby human sources of fecal contamination.6 Most water-quality problems on California beaches are
attributable to nonpoint source runoff,7,8 and it is not certain
that waterborne bacterial indicators would be as predictive
when nonhuman sources predominate.9 Animals can shed
bacterial indicators without certain accompanying human
pathogens.10 For this reason, there is uncertainty about the
current practice of extrapolating water-quality thresholds
based on studies of human point source to nonpoint sources
dominated by animal-associated fecal contamination. A poor
correlation between bacterial indicators and virus concentrations has been found in urban runoff,11,12 in contrast to the
substantial relationships in water bodies polluted by human
fecal sources (eg, septic tanks).13 This discrepancy is further
complicated by the differential survival of bacteria relative to
viruses, particularly in marine water. Enteric viruses and
bacterial viruses (ie, coliphage) are promising indicators of
fecal contamination, but they have been inadequately studied
as predictors of health effects in bathers.14 The human specific viruses most commonly associated with symptoms in
swimmers include adenovirus and norovirus. Coliphages are
viruses that infect Escherichia coli bacteria. As such, they
may be more useful than E. coli alone, since coliphage
survival may be more akin to virus survival than fecal-

indicator bacteria. The F⫹ coliphages, in particular, are most
commonly associated with fecal material and sewage.
We conducted a cohort study in Mission Bay, California, where state water-quality standards have been exceeded
approximately 20% of the time.15 Several million dollars
have been expended to reduce human contamination by
inspecting and repairing the sanitary sewerage system surrounding the bay and diverting larger storm drains away from
the bay. Recent source-tracking studies suggested that human
fecal material constitutes a minor proportion (⬍10%) of fecal
inputs to the Bay.16 However, Mission Bay continues to
exceed California water quality standards.15,17
To address the need for faster, more specific waterquality measurements, microbiologists are developing robust
new test methods. Chromogenic substrate assays for fecal
indicators have become increasingly popular because they are
faster and easier than traditional methods while producing
comparable results.18 Gene-based techniques are not yet commercially available for fecal indicator bacteria, but researchers are capable of obtaining results in a matter of hours.19
Finally, researchers are exploring new microbial indicators,
such as Bacteroides, a group of obligate anaerobes that are
abundant in intestinal flora.20,21 Gene-based techniques also
provide new tools for directly measuring pathogens, including human specific viruses.22–24 Regardless of rapidity, specificity, or cost, the efficacy of any new public health monitoring tool can be evaluated only through epidemiologic
studies that document relationships to the incidence of swimming-related illness.
The goal of this study was to examine health effects
experienced by swimmers and the relationship of these effects to water quality indicators in water in which nonhuman
fecal sources dominate. The study was designed to determine
whether water contact increased the risk of illness in the 2
weeks after exposure to water and whether the risk of illness
increased with increasing levels of traditional microbial
indicators of water quality. As a corollary question, we
also considered the risk of illness with increasing levels of
new, nontraditional microbial methods or indicators of
water quality.

METHODS
The study was designed as a prospective cohort, similar
in design to many prior beach studies.3,10 Participants were
recruited each sampling day, and their current health and
degree of exposure to the water were recorded. Swimmer
exposure was measured by sampling water quality at multiple
sites per beach and multiple time periods per day. Ten to 14
days later, participants were contacted by phone and interviewed about symptoms of illness that occurred after their
beach visit. We used regression models to evaluate the
association between exposure to water quality indicators and
illness, and to compare the risk of illnesses between swimmers and nonswimmers.

Sampling Sites
Beach-goers were recruited at 6 Mission Bay beaches
on weekends and holidays in 2003, beginning Memorial Day

28

weekend and continuing through Labor Day. Water quality
samples were collected at the same 6 beaches. Eighteen
sampling sites were targeted, with the number of sites per
beach ranging from 2 to 5, depending upon beach length and
anticipated swimming activity. Data were collected on 29
days.

Water Quality Data Collection and Analysis
(Indicator Organisms)
Three traditional indicators (enterococcus, total coliforms, fecal coliforms) were measured by traditional membrane filtration methods as well as by the chromogenic
substrate method. Enterococcus was also determined by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Five measures were new indicators (Bacteroides, somatic coliphage,
male-specific coliphage, adenovirus, and norovirus).
Water samples were collected with varying frequency,
depending on the specific indicator. The indicators, sampling
frequency, and laboratory analysis methods are shown in
Appendix A (available with the online version of this article).
Additional details regarding laboratory procedures are available in the project technical report.25

Human Health Data Collection
All study instruments and protocols were approved by
the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the
University of California, Berkeley.

Beach Recruitment
Eligibility criteria included: (1) no previous participation
in the study; (2) at least one family member of the household at
the beach age 18-year-old or older; (3) home address in the
United States, Canada, or Mexico; and (4) no history of swimming (face or head under water) in the ocean or in a lake in the
previous 7 days. If an individual or household was eligible and
agreed to participate, participants provided signed consent.
Adults gave signed consent for children under 18. Interviewers
recorded which water sampling site was closest to the location of
the individual or family on the beach. Participants were given
beach balls and asked to complete a questionnaire prior to their
departure that day. The questionnaire assessed possible exposures at the beach, and exposures or illnesses experienced during
the previous 2–3 days. Participants who failed to complete the
survey at the beach were contacted within 3 days by telephone.

Follow-Up Interview
Approximately 14 days after their beach visit, participants were telephoned and asked to complete a 10- to 15minute interview. This interview included questions on: (1)
demographic information (2); swimming and other exposures
since the beach day; (3) pre-existing health problems (e.g.,
chronic diarrhea); and (4) acute health conditions experienced
since the visit to the beach. The head of household answered
questions for children younger than 18 years of age.

Health Outcomes Measured
Health outcomes included gastrointestinal (GI) illness,
respiratory symptoms, dermatologic symptoms, and other
nonspecific symptoms. GI symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. In addition, 2 categories

Epidemiology • Volume 18, Number 1, January 2007

of highly credible gastrointestinal illness (HCGI) were measured. One (HCGI-1) was defined as either: (1) vomiting; (2)
diarrhea and fever; or (3) cramps and fever. The second
(HCGI-2) was defined as vomiting plus fever, which is
consistent with categories of GI illness defined by Haile et
al6,25 Respiratory outcomes included cough, cough with
phlegm, nasal congestion or runny nose, sore throat, and
significant respiratory disease, defined as: (1) fever plus nasal
congestion; or (2) fever plus sore throat; or (3) cough with
phlegm. This definition is also consistent with Haile et al6
Dermatologic outcomes included skin rashes and infected
cuts or scrapes. Nonspecific symptoms included fever, redness or eye irritation, earache, and ear discharge. Respondents who reported a symptom associated with one of the
health outcomes at baseline (within 72 hours prior to the
beach visit) were excluded from analysis of that particular
outcome, but not of other outcomes.

Data Analysis
We initially evaluated any differences in illness rates
between swimmers and nonswimmers. The analyses were conducted for 2 definitions of swimming: any water contact at the
beach, and swallowing any water. Nonswimmers were those
who had no contact with water during their day at the beach.
The second group of analyses consisted of regression
models to evaluate the association between risk of illness in
swimmers and water quality (as measured by the various
indicators). In these models, the main outcome was a binary
indicator of illness and a continuous measure of exposure,
modeled as the geometric mean (on a logarithmic scale) for
the indicator at the time and place of the swimmer’s exposure. As a secondary analysis, enterococcus was treated as a
dichotomous variable using California state water quality thresholds as cutpoints (⬎35 versus ⱕ35 in one analysis and ⬎104
vs. ⱕ104 in a separate analysis). In all models involving water
quality indicators, a value of zero was used for water quality
exposure values below the detection limit of the test.
Multivariate models included the following potential
confounding factors: age, sex, ethnicity, income, allergies,
swimming after the beach interview, collecting shells at the
beach, digging in sand, playing with seaweed or algae,
chronic or pre-existing illnesses, contact with other sick
people, use of insect repellant at the beach, use of sunblock,
showering immediately after swimming, consumption of raw
or undercooked eggs or meat, and consumption of food at the
beach. All variables except age were categorized as 1 or 0.
Race was dichotomized as white or nonwhite.
All analyses were conducted using a nested interaction
model that effectively assigned nonswimmers a zero exposure value, while including an indicator of swimming. The
model permits comparisons among swimmers with different
levels of indicator exposure as well as comparisons of swimmers versus nonswimmers independent of indicator level.
This model is parameterized as follows:

where p ⫽ probability of illness; x1 ⫽ 1 if any contact with
water, 0 otherwise; x2 is a water quality indicator value
(continuous); and x3 is a 1/0 indicator of other specific water
exposure (body contact, head under water, etc.). In the multivariate analyses, we used a backwards deletion procedure to
identify factors that most affected the water quality/illness
relationship.26
The risk of illness was expressed as an adjusted odds
ratio (OR), with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI).
For models comparing swimmers and nonswimmers, the OR
can be interpreted as the odds of a specific illness in swimmers divided by the odds of illness in nonswimmers. For
models assessing the association between water-quality indicators among swimmers, the OR can be interpreted as the
increase in the odds of illness per unit of increase in the
water-quality measure among swimmers. ORs were calculated by exponentiation of the regression coefficient provided
by the model output.
Models adjusted for relevant covariates were used to
estimate the percentages of swimmers and nonswimmers ill
for any health outcomes. The adjusted attributable-risk estimates were determined by estimating adjusted probabilities
of swimmers and nonswimmers from a multivariate logistic
model, weighting the covariates as the mean value for each
covariate. The adjusted attributable risk was then calculated as
the difference between the probability of illness among swimmers with mean levels of covariates and nonswimmers with
mean levels of covariates. These results are expressed as the
number of excess cases of illness predicted among 1,000 swimmers (along with a 95% confidence interval of this estimate).

RESULTS
Water Quality
This beach was open for recreational use during the
entire study period. A total of 1897 water samples were
collected. All but 5 of these samples were analyzed successfully in the laboratory. The majority of samples had quantifiable levels of indicator bacteria. (See Appendix B, which is
available with the online version of the Journal at www.
epidem.com.) Approximately 16% of the samples exceeded
state water quality thresholds for traditional fecal indicator
bacteria, with enterococcus accounting for most of the exceedances (96%) and total coliforms the least (2%). These
percents are similar to historical results from Mission Bay
and from other studies.15,6 Pathogenic virus was detected in
only one sample. The majority of samples had quantifiable
levels of somatic coliphage, but not of male-specific coliphage. The range of concentrations for virus measurements is
shown in Appendix B.

Health Outcomes
A total of 12,469 individuals from 5,062 households were
enrolled in the study. Of these, 8797 (71%) of the enrolled
participants and 3501 (69%) of the households completed the
follow-up telephone interview. Fifty-seven percent (n ⫽ 4971)
of those who completed the follow-up interview were swimmers. Tables 1 and 2 show the individual and household sociodemographic characteristics of the study group.

Swimmers had a significant increase in diarrhea (OR ⫽
1.4; 95% CI ⫽ 1.0 –1.8) and skin rash (2.3; 1.6 –3.2) when
swimming was defined as having any water contact (Table 3).
When swimming was defined as having swallowed water, the
risk of diarrhea was increased (1.9; 1.3–2.7), with risks also
for cramps (1.5; 1.1 – 2.2), skin rash (2.1; 1.4 –.2), and eye
irritation (1.7; 1.2–2.3; Table 3).
We explored the relationship between participant age
and health outcomes after water exposure (Table 4). Among
participants with any water contact, the strongest association
with diarrhea was among children ages 5 to 12 years (OR ⫽
2.8; 95% CI ⫽ 1.1–7.3). The OR increased with increased
exposure in the 5- to 12-year-old age group (5.3; 2.0 –14). In
several age groups, skin rash was significantly associated
with any water contact or with swallowing water. Associations also were found among those who swallowed water and
who reported skin rash (ages 0 –5 and 5–12 years) and eye
irritation (ages 5–12 years). Similar patterns were seen within
strata of race/ethnicity (Appendix C, available with the online
version of this article).
Attributable risk was calculated for diarrhea, stratified
by age group. (See Appendix D, which is available with the
online version of the Journal at www.epidem.com.) The
estimated excess of cases among swimmers versus nonswimmers was greatest in participants age 5–12 years with any
water contact (27 excess cases per 1000 swimmers) and

Water Quality and Health Outcomes Among
Swimmers
No correlation was observed between traditional water
quality indicator levels for enterococcus, fecal coliform, or
total coliform and the risk of illness. Using diarrhea as an
example, there were no notable elevations in risk with enterococcus (Table 5). This result persisted even with numerous approaches to assigning water quality exposure (eg,
combining or separating sites at a beach) or to calculation of
indicator metrics (daily geometric mean, daily maxima, or
various cutpoints). Of particular note, exposure to indicator
measures above the 2 different California state water quality
thresholds did not show increased risk of illness (Table 6).
We found no correlation of Bacteroides, enterococcus
using rapid methods (qPCR), human pathogenic virus (adenovirus and norovirus), or somatic phage with increased risk
of illness (results available in technical report).25 The relationship with viruses could not be adequately evaluated
because no norovirus was found, and adenovirus was detected in only one sample. These low counts were consistent
with the absence of risk for other health outcomes evaluated.
Our data suggest associations between the levels of
male-specific coliphage and gastrointestinal illnesses, nausea,
cough, and fever (Table 7). However, a low number of
participants were exposed to the water at times when male© 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

specific coliphage was detected. (See Appendix E, which is
available with the online version of the Journal at www.
epidem.com.)

DISCUSSION
Swimmers (those having any water contact) experienced more diarrhea and skin rash than nonswimmers in
Mission Bay. The incidence of these symptoms increased
with greater exposure categories (eg, swallowing water),
further suggesting that these symptoms were mediated by
water contact. However, increased risk was not observed for
more severe symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or HCGI-1 or
HCGI-2. These latter symptoms have been the foundation for
Federal and State water quality thresholds5,6 and have been
the focus of most previous epidemiology studies.3 Symptoms
such as HCGI are considered more relevant because multisymptom reactions that include fever are typically pathogenmediated, whereas symptoms such as rash and diarrhea could
potentially result from saltwater irritation.
Previous studies have observed a fairly broad range of
illnesses, probably reflecting diversity in study populations as
well as differences in illness definitions and methods of data
collection. The illness incidence observed at Mission Bay
falls within the range previously reported, although GI symptom incidence occurred in the lower part of the range. For
example, diarrhea was reported by 4 – 6% of swimmers in
Mission Bay compared with 5– 6% in Santa Monica, Califor-

Lakes (for GI illness without fever),28 and 14% in the United

With regard to levels of pollution, a fairly wide range
has been previously reported as a result of the differences in
the beach sites, the sources of pollution affecting these sites,
and aspects of water sampling (for example, frequency of
sample collection, depth, and time of collection). The levels
observed in Mission Bay are, however, broadly within the
range reported in other studies at marine locations. In Santa
Monica, between 0% and 45% of samples exceeded 106
enterococci cfu/100 mL depending on the sample location,

32

whereas in Mission Bay, 14% of all samples exceeded the
current California enterococcus threshold of 104 cfu/100
mL.27 In Mission Bay, we observed a geometric mean of 29
enterococci cfu/100 mL. Cabelli et al,5 in the New York
studies, observed a range of 16 –91 fecal streptococci cfu/100
mL, a group very similar to the enterococci group. In New
Zealand, a median of 3.5 enterococci cfu/100 mL was reported, although in this study 2 “pristine” beaches were
included in the analysis.30 (Note that the median and the
geometric mean are fairly commensurate measures, and the
geometric mean equals the median when the data are lognormally distributed.) In Australia, Corbett and colleagues31

ported median enterococci levels of 2 cfu/100 mL at a
relatively unpolluted beach, and 50 cfu/100 mL at a beach
affected by fecal waste.
Although levels of contamination and rates of illness
were comparable with previous studies, we found no rela-

33



Colford et al

tionship between fecal indicator bacteria and illness rates.3,6
This result is unlike most previous marine recreational epidemiology studies. Wade et al3 reviewed 27 relevant marine
recreational water epidemiology studies; most showed increased risk with increasing fecal indicator concentrations,
particularly with enterococcus. However, in essentially all of
these studies, there were known sources of human fecal
contamination. There appears to be little human fecal contamination in Mission Bay, as evidenced by a recent source
tracking study showing that the predominant source of fecal
contamination was avian.16 Although animal sources can
harbor disease-causing agents, they are less likely to serve
as sources of some human enteric diseases, especially
those diseases caused by enteric viruses.10 There is, however, no grazing by cattle, sheep, or other animals in this
watershed.
The use of bacterial indicators as predictors of swimmingassociated illnesses is based on the presumption that the indicator bacteria have survival properties similar to the pathogens that
cause disease. This presumption is less likely to be true when
water circulation is restricted and bacterial residence times
increase, which can be days to weeks in Mission Bay.33 Increased survival, and perhaps even regrowth of fecal indicator
bacteria, has been suggested in the sediments and wrack lining
beaches such as Mission Bay.17,34 Regardless, the lack of relationship of nonhuman sources of fecal indicator bacteria to
health risk suggests that the water contact advisories posted at
Mission Bay beaches during the course of this study were
not predictive of a public health risk. This conclusion was
also apparent when traditional bacterial indicators were
measured using qPCR. This contrasts with a recent study
which observed a relationship between enterococcus measured by qPCR and gastrointestinal illness at Great Lakes
beaches.28 Unlike Mission Bay, however, these beaches
had human fecal contamination.
It is uncertain whether viral measures in our study could
be used in place of bacterial indicators for health risk assessments in Mission Bay. Male-specific coliphage was correlated
with increased incidence of several health outcomes, including
HCGI-1, HCGI-2, nausea, cough, and fever (Table 7). This is
consistent with the success of this measure in freshwater application and edible bivalve molluscan shellfish.35,36 However, we
interpret these associations cautiously because male-specific
coliphage was not detected often, and few subjects were exposed
to the water at those times (Appendix E).
The human-specific viruses we measured in Mission
Bay were rarely detected, which is consistent with our low
rates of swimming-associated illnesses. We did not encounter high virus counts that would have allowed us to
assess their effectiveness as predictors. The interpretation
of viruses as negative predictors is potentially compromised by technology limitations. We used the most advanced techniques available, but quantifying virus particles in seawater is difficult; DNA and RNA are lost as the
result of complexation and interferences when concentrating and extracting nucleic acid material.12,21,22 Thus, we
cannot be certain that the low levels of positive samples we
observed were due to their absence, or due to the technical

34

Epidemiology • Volume 18, Number 1, January 2007

difficulties in recovering and measuring viruses that may
have been present. Our results are at least consistent with
the possibility that viral measures are more effective than
traditional bacterial indicators as predictors of illness when
nonhuman sources of contamination are dominant.
Although we found that traditional fecal indicators
were ineffective predictors of health effects, it is unclear
whether Mission Bay is the exception or the rule. Mission
Bay has been subjected to extensive cleanup activities that
has reduced human fecal sources, whereas human fecal material may still be an important contributor to nonpoint
sources at other beaches.15–17,37 It would also be inappropriate to extrapolate our results beyond our specific study
conditions. We would expect to see an increase in health
risks, and likely an association with bacterial indicators of
water quality, if large sources of untreated human fecal
material such as a sewage overflow entered the Bay. Finally,
we examined swimming-related illnesses only during dry
weather. No epidemiologic data currently exist for any beach
to assess whether health risks are associated with swimming
at beaches with nonpoint, nonhuman source inputs following
rainfall. Wet weather typically produces transient increases in
levels of fecal contamination at beaches, yet most disease
outbreaks associated with wet weather have been due to
drinking water.38
In summary, we found an elevation in rash and diarrhea
among swimmers compared with nonswimmers in Mission
Bay, California in the summer of 2003. The risk of 12 other
illnesses, including highly credible GI illnesses and significant respiratory disease, were not markedly increased. There
were no associations between levels of traditional fecal indicator bacteria (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterococcus)
and illness. The exceeding of California’s marine recreational
water quality thresholds for traditional fecal indicator bacteria
was not associated with increased risk of illness. In addition,
there were no associations between Bacteroides, enterococcus using rapid methods (PCR), human pathogenic virus
(adenovirus and norovirus), or somatic coliphage and illness.
There were associations between male-specific coliphage and
illness, but we interpret these associations cautiously because
so few subjects overall were exposed.
Our findings do not agree with earlier studies reporting
associations between bacterial indicators of water quality and
illness. We believe these results are due to a lack of human
sources of traditional fecal indicator bacteria, supported by
our lack of virus detection and an independent microbial
tracking survey. Like Mission Bay, many enclosed marine
beaches, in California and elsewhere, suffer from impaired
water quality due to nonpoint sources of bacteria and poor
circulation. We do not recommend extrapolation to other
beaches at this time, however, as we are uncertain if Mission
Bay has unique site characteristics. Further studies to confirm
the reduced risk of swimming-related illnesses at beaches
contaminated by nonpoint sources of fecal pollution appear
justified. The predictive abilities of coliphages as microbial
indicators of recreational water quality also need further
investigation.
