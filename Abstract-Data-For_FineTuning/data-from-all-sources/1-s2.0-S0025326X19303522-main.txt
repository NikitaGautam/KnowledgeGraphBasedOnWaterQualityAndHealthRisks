This review examines the aims of and approaches to the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) of
untreated recreational waters. The literature search was conducted on four databases and yielded 54 papers,
which were analyzed on a quantitative (time-trend, geographical distribution, water type) and qualitative (aims,
source of microbial data, pathogens and their measurement or estimation, ways to address variability and uncertainty, sensitivity analysis) basis. In addition, the parameters, implications, and limitations were discussed for
each QMRA step. Since 2003, the number of papers has greatly increased, highlighting the importance of QMRA
for the risk management of recreational waters. Nevertheless, QMRA still exhibits critical issues, above all regarding contamination data and dose-response relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first review to give a
wide panoramic view on QMRA in relation to recreational exposure to untreated waters. This could be useful in
identifying the current knowledge gaps and research needs.

1. Introduction
The Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) estimates the
infectious/illness risk of exposure to microorganisms, on the basis of
dose-response relations between the number of pathogens and the
health effects (Haas et al., 2014). The QMRA follows the paradigm of
the chemical risk assessment but is complicated by the intrinsic nature
of biological agents and the complexity of the host-pathogen relationship. Quantitative risk assessment for chemical substances is generally
based on chronic assumption, but chronic exposure to pathogens suffers
by a higher degree of uncertainty compared to chemicals: the daily
occurrence and level of microorganisms in the environment is highly
variable, and the methods for microbial sampling and analysis show
different specificity and sensibility, thus may influence the measurements.
Nevertheless, current international guidelines suggest the application of QMRA as risk assessment approach in the context of microbial
water quality management (WHO, 2016). This is because QMRA provides valuable support in the risk analysis, since it predicts the risk of
illness, even when the fraction of disease attributable to water is low or
difficult to measure directly through public health surveillance or epidemiological studies.
The QMRA was initially used for drinking water in order to set

health targets for water consumption (WHO, 2011). In addition, QMRA
was recommended as the preferred methodology to evaluate the risks
associated with greywater or wastewater reuse in agriculture (WHO,
2006), or potable reuse in the USA, as described in the recent EPA
compendium (USEPA, 2017). In 2003, the QMRA was indicated by
WHO as a valid methodology for recreational water risk management
(WHO, 2003), and to date some governments have already integrated
QMRA in their guidelines, such as Australia (NHMRC, 2008), USA
(USEPA, 2012), and New Zealand (MfE, 2003).
In the last 15 years, numerous studies have also attempted to evaluate the health risks associated with exposure to the recreational use of
waters, which could be responsible for adverse health outcomes
(mainly gastroenteritis), in the case of fecal pollution (Hlavsa et al.,
2015). Although some studies have implemented QMRA for recreational exposure to treated waters and artificial environments, such as
swimming pools and water parks (Armstrong and Haas, 2007; Schets
et al., 2011; Pintar et al., 2010; Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2014, 2015;
Suppes et al., 2016; Weir et al., 2011; de Man et al., 2013, 2014;
Hamilton et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2017), the majority of studies address
natural recreational waters, which are defined by WHO as “any coastal,
estuarine or freshwater area where any type of recreational usage of the
water is made by a significant number of users” (WHO, 2003).

recreational waters has mainly been based on epidemiological studies
considering the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) or acute febrile respiratory illnesses (AFRI) in relation to the amount of the Fecal
Indicator Bacteria (FIB) detected in the same waters (Kay et al., 1994;
Fleisher et al., 1998; Wiedenmann et al., 2002). Although these studies
are very useful in waters impacted by sewage-sources of pollution
(WHO, 2003; USEPA, 2010), they are less sensitive than estimations
using QMRA. In addition, QMRA can predict swimmer illnesses at nonsewage impacted recreational waters, while to date current epidemiological studies have not been able to clearly show a relationship between water quality based on FIB and adverse human health effects,
because the mix and densities of FIB and pathogens in animal fecal
sources are different from those in sewages (WHO, 2003; Schoen and
Ashbolt, 2010). The QMRA approach explores different scenarios via
numerical simulations and predicts the risk to human health. It can thus
be used in conjunction with or in lieu of epidemiological findings, as a
valuable framework for risk management. Ashbolt et al. (2010) explored the advantages and limitations of QMRA application to the
safety management of bathing waters, to understand the possible
practical implementation of QMRA by regulators and beach managers.
In another extended review Van Abel and Taylor (2018) addressed the
topic of QMRA to estimate the health risks of different types of water
exposure, including recreational ones, but focusing on viral agents and
on studies from sub-Saharan Africa.
In the present work, we extended the review to papers published
from 2003 to 2018 with the focus on the aims and the approaches used,
including the related issues. To our best knowledge, this is the first
review on QMRA applied to recreational exposure to untreated waters,
with such a wide panoramic view. This could be useful in identifying
the current knowledge gaps and research needs for future QMRA developments.

and used a systematic approach to retrieve the relevant research studies
(Fig. 1).
The literature search was conducted on November 7, 2018, using
the following four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect,
and Web of Science core collection. The searches were performed using
the following search terms in the query: (QMRA OR “quantitative microbial risk assessment”) AND (“bathing waters” OR “recreational waters” OR recreation OR bathing).
The above database searches provided 374 hits. Publication selection followed four main criteria, based on papers: (1) focusing on recreational exposure to natural waters including both coastal (marine or
estuarine) and inland waters (i.e. lakes, rivers, canals); (2) in English,
(3) performing QMRA based on pathogens, (4) original research article
and peer reviewed.
The papers identified by the online search engines were first
screened by two reviewers in terms of the inclusion criteria based on
title and abstract. Duplicates were removed, and documents deemed
relevant were kept for a full reading. Any doubt about the inclusion was
resolved by one other reviewer. In total, 61 original articles were selected for full reading, then seven papers were removed after inclusion
because of the following two reasons: the full text was not in English,
and/or the QMRA was based on indicators, using a dose–response relationship developed from epidemiological studies (Haas et al., 2014).
The list of references excluded with reasons is reported in Appendix 1 of
the Supplementary information. Overall, 54 studies were included in
this review. A general description of the 54 articles that complied with
the selection criteria is reported in Appendix 2 of the Supporting Information (Table S1).
2.2. Classification criteria
The reviewed papers were initially categorized according to: (i) the
time of publication, (ii) the geographical location in which the study
was carried on, divided into six macro-areas according to United Nation
geoscheme with some modifications (North America, South America,
Europe, Asian countries, Oceania, and Africa); and (iii) the water type
(coastal or inland bathing waters).
Studies were also analyzed from a qualitative point of view, in order

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Literature research and selection criteria
To ensure the thoroughness of the literature coverage, this review
followed the well-established PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009)

Africa were from South Africa (3 of 5) Kenya (1) and Uganda (1). In
South America, QMRA studies were carried out in Brazil (2 of 5), Argentina (1), Puerto Rico (1), and Venezuela (1).
The majority of the reviewed studies focused on inland waters
(58%), followed by marine waters (38%), and 4% of the studies considered both types of water.
As regards inland waters, 14 (26.9%) studies were on rivers and
canals, 11 (21.2%) on lakes, and 5 (9.6%) on simulated scenarios of
freshwaters.
Studies on marine waters mainly concerned coastal waters (15,
28.8%) while five studies (9.6%) focused on the simulated scenarios of
coastal environments.
Two studies applied QMRA to both coastal and inland waters. Data
used to derive these percentages are reported in Appendix 1, Table S1.
Fig. 2. Time-trend of QMRA studies on recreational waters.

3.2. Aims of QMRA in the study design

to understand: (i) the aim of the QMRA in the study design, and (ii) the
approach to each step of the QMRA framework: hazard identification
(pathogens of concern), exposure assessment (calculation of pathogen
concentration and accidental volume swallowed), dose-response assessment (equation and parameters) and risk characterization (approach to variability and uncertainties and sensitivity analysis). For
these steps, a critical evaluation of the assumptions and data used was
carried out, in order to understand the current gaps in this field of study
and the needs for further research.

The classification of papers based on different QMRA purposes is
described in Fig. 4. In descending order of the number of studies, the
aims were: (i) to evaluate the differences in health risk according to age
(adults versus children) or gender; (ii) to estimate the health risks
caused by exposure to viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens, where
no epidemiological data are available; (iii) to understand the impact of
different hazardous events (i.e. heavy rainfall, CSO discharge, sediment
re-suspension); (iv) to compare health risks derived from different
bathing activities, with high (i.e. swimming) or low water contact (i.e.
surfing, canoeing, fishing); (v) to simulate the influence of multiple
sources of fecal pollution in receiving waters; (vi) to interpret MST
markers concentration from the perspective of swimmers' health risks;
(vii) to improve the interpretation of epidemiological studies on recreational waters; (viii) to evaluate the impact of control measures on
health risks.
Some studies reported more than one aim, thus the sum of the
number of papers is more than 54 (Fig. 4a). The percentage of each aim
is reported in Fig. 4b, in which studies with more than one aim are
separated and considered together, and the frequency is calculated on
the basis of studies with a single aim.
Table S1 reports the aim(s) of each study, and the description of
each QMRA aim is given below.

3. Results
3.1. Time trend of QMRA studies, geographical location, and types of water
From our literature search, the first QMRA paper on recreational
natural waters was published in 2003. We then observed a continuous
increase in the number of QMRA articles, up to the end of 2018 (when
some of the collected papers were already dated 2019) (Fig. 2).
The geographical distribution of QMRA studies on bathing waters is
illustrated in Fig. 3. Most of the publications were from North America
(USA and Canada) (26 papers, 48.1%), above all (23 papers) from the
USA, followed by Asian countries (8, 14.8%), Europe (7, 13.0%), Africa
(5, 9.3%) and South America (5, 9.3%), and Australia (3, 5.6%). Of the
Asian countries, QMRA studies were carried out in China (4 papers),
Singapore (2) and Thailand (2). In Europe, the QMRA studies were
mainly from The Netherlands (4 out of 7), while Germany, Denmark,
and Norway accounted for one study each. Reviewed papers from

3.2.1. Evaluating the differences in health risks according to age and gender
Most of the reviewed studies (18) took into account risks for specific
target groups, in particular for children. Children undertake more frequent and prolonged water activities, thus submerging their heads

during bathing and ingesting significantly more water, and some studies demonstrated that the longer exposure is responsible for the higher
rate of swimming-associated illnesses compared to adults (Wade et al.,
2008). Moreover, children can be more vulnerable since they have a
weaker immunity and may develop more severe diseases than adults
(Schets et al., 2011). In three of these studies (Schets et al., 2011;
Dickinson et al., 2013; Rodrigues et al., 2016) and in another paper
(Andersen et al., 2013), the focus was also on gender, taking into account the different levels of exposure for males and females during
swimming. In the majority of studies (75%), this aim did not represent
the principal purpose of the study, but was generally associated with
others aims (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Information).

were available, and to investigate the dominant risk agent among the
various pathogens, which were chosen on the basis of the study area
under investigation, as reported in Table S1. For example, in freshwaters affected by agricultural sources of animal fecal contamination,
Soller et al. (2015) found that E. coli O157, Cryptosporidium spp., and
Campylobacter jejuni were the predicted dominant risk agents of cattleimpacted waters, pig-impacted waters, and chicken-impacted waters,
respectively. On the other hand, in freshwaters impacted by sewage
sources, Teklehaimanot et al. (2015) identified Vibrio cholerae as the
pathogen responsible for a higher infection risk than Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella dysenteriae.
The other five studies focused on a specific pathogen, in order to
correlate risk estimation with water quality based on FIB (Craig et al.,
2003) or with microbial source tracking markers (Staley et al., 2012),
and to assess site-specific health risks more precisely (Pintar et al.,
2010; Lapen et al., 2016; Prez et al., 2015).

3.2.2. Estimating risks caused by exposure to different pathogens
Thirteen QMRA studies addressed the risk estimation from exposure
to different pathogens, using different approaches.
In eight of these studies, QMRA was used to estimate the risk of GI
illness from recreational waters even when no epidemiological data

3.2.3. Understanding the impact of different hazardous events
The majority of these studies (6 of 12) investigated the role of
meteorological conditions on health risks, focusing on increasing risk
during swimming in “post-storm” conditions, defined as the period
between 24 h and 72 h after a recorded precipitation event (Adell et al.,
2016; Andersen et al., 2013; Diallo et al., 2008; Eregno et al., 2016; Lim
et al., 2017; Soller et al., 2017).
Soller et al. (2015) calculated the risk derived from rainfall-induced
runoff from a manure-applied land into the surface waters, simulating
the mobilization of FIB and pathogens.
Abia et al. (2016) used QMRA to investigate the differences in
health risks at a recreational river under undisturbed conditions and in
the case of sediment re-suspension. Seto et al. (2016) assessed the impact of wastewater treatment plants blending that was discharged into
marine waters through a deep-water outfall.
Schijven et al. (2013) and Sterk et al. (2015, 2016) focused on the
modification of risk due to climate change that impacts on bathing
waters (i.e. water temperature, salinity) and thus facilitate the diffusion
of Vibrio spp. (Sterk et al., 2015), and also on the increase in intensive
precipitation events and CSOs.

Ashbolt, 2010; Schoen et al., 2011; Soller et al., 2010a, 2014,
2015). In these papers, the authors considered idealized scenarios
where fecal contamination was assumed to be recent and from a
single source at a time, except for Soller et al. (2014) who considered various mixtures (i.e. human/non-pathogenic, human/gull,
human/pig, and human/chicken fecal).
3.2.6. Interpreting MST markers concentration from the perspective of
swimmers' health risks
Microbial Source Tracking (MST) methods identify the microbial
contamination of human origin (sewage) and from key animal groups
that potentially contaminate recreational waters, mainly ruminants
(e.g., cattle, deer), avians (i.e., gulls), and canines (dogs), through the
detection of genetic markers specific for each type of fecal pollution
(USEPA, 2005).
In five of the reviewed studies, the authors used QMRA to interpret
MST markers, which provide information on the potential sources
(human or host feces) and the magnitude of the contamination (high or
low levels of pollution), but nothing about their role in terms of human
health risks. Thus, the MST-based QMRA is used to interpret the relationship between MST markers concentration and the significant
health risk for swimmers, in order to assess the threshold concentration
corresponding to a tolerable risk in the bathing waters, for example, set
by USEPA at 0.03 (three cases of illness/100 swimmers) (USEPA, 2012).
In these studies, the authors linked the measured concentrations of fecal
markers to health risk estimated from exposure to one or more selected
pathogens, in the same recreational waters. For example, QMRA was
used to estimate a risk-based threshold for MST markers specific for
animal contamination by gulls (Brown et al., 2017a) or human contamination (Boehm et al., 2015; Ahmed et al., 2018), or a mixture of
both (Brown et al., 2017b). Staley et al. (2012) investigated the link
between the human health risk and human fecal markers (HF183), but
without providing a threshold concentration, because they used a limit
of detection (LOD) approach. They associated the health risk with the
value at which HF183 was detectable, based on QMRA simulation using
norovirus (NoV) as the reference pathogen.
These studies are linked by a series of assumptions and simplifications, including: the considered source of fecal contamination is the
only source of pathogen; the contamination is recent (fresh fecal contamination), thus no attenuation (decay rate) is considered between the
contamination episode and the swimmers' exposure; and the ratio between the MST markers and the reference pathogen is the same in the
studied pollution source and in the recreational waters. Future development should analyse more complex scenarios, through the incorporation in the model of marker or pathogen inactivation data and
transport time for fecal sources to the receiving waters.

3.2.4. Comparing health risks derived from different recreation activities
Ten studies investigated the differences in health risks according to
the type of recreation activities, considering separately the risk associated with full-contact recreation (such as swimming exposure) and
low-contact activities, such as canoeing, boating, playing in water or
fishing, through the use of separate ingestion rates for all the activities
of concern (Cui et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2018; Fuhrimann et al., 2016;
Kundu et al., 2013; Van Abel et al., 2017; Vergara et al., 2016; Xiao
et al., 2018b).
The surfer population represented a target group of particular interest, due to the fact that they generally frequent beaches all year
round, thus also during storm events which are notoriously accompanied by water quality impairments (Dickinson et al., 2013; Soller
et al., 2017). Andersen et al. (2013) investigated a group of athletes
(the Ironman triathlon athletes), when the competitions took place
during post-storm events.
3.2.5. Evaluating the influence of multiple sources of fecal pollution in
receiving waters
In nine studies, the authors performed a “relative-QMRA” (according to the definition by USEPA, 2010), to evaluate the relative
importance of different pollution sources together with fecal source
apportionment (SA, hereafter). These studies focused on the water
impacted by human and animal waste (Adell et al., 2016; Liao et al.,
2016; Lim et al., 2017; Schoen et al., 2011; Soller et al., 2010a, 2014),
by a mixture of animal sources (Soller et al., 2015; Whelan et al., 2014),
and by different human sources (Schoen and Ashbolt, 2010). In the
reviewed papers, the QMRA was carried out using three different approaches for the SA, described as follows.

3.2.7. Improving the interpretation of epidemiological studies on
recreational waters
In four studies, the QMRA was used in conjunction with epidemiological findings, to enhance the knowledge about the health risk
from recreational waters, and to provide additional information to assist the interpretation of the epidemiological results.
Ashbolt and Bruno (2003) fitted a QMRA model to the published
relationship between enterococci concentrations and the probability of
GI illness observed in an UK epidemiological study, in order to understand the uncertainties in applying the results to regions such as Sydney
with different environmental conditions (i.e. warm and clear waters
subjected to high sunlight intensities) which could affect enterococci
survival.
Soller et al. (2010b) used QMRA to understand which pathogens
caused GI illnesses in epidemiological studies conducted in the Great
Lakes in the US. The authors performed a reverse-QMRA where the
density of each reference pathogen was calculated from the known
math formulas of the dose-response relationship, which was based on
the observed health effects among swimmers and the primary fecal

(a) In a wide watershed-based modelling infrastructure, the SA relied
on a hydrodynamic model based on the sources (Liao et al., 2016;
Whelan et al., 2014): the contribution of each fecal source is derived from the integrated environmental model, which includes fate
and transport considerations from the source-of-release to the
point-of-exposure, represented by the recreational site.
(b) At the point-of-exposure, the SA relied on microbial source tracking
(MST) methodology (Adell et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2017) in samples
collected at the recreational site, thus the QMRA calculates the
health risk from exposure to each specifically identified source.
(c) In hypothetical scenarios, the SA was based on literature data regarding: reference pathogens and/or FIB concentrations in each
fecal source, fraction of human-infectious pathogenic strains from
each source, and prevalence of infection in the non-human sources
(proportion of animals shedding the pathogen) (Schoen and
338

I. Federigi, et al.

sources responsible for the contamination of bathing waters. The authors deduced that NoV was the etiological agent of the vast majority of
illnesses at the freshwater sites impacted by human contamination.
In another study by Soller et al. (2016), QMRA led to the prediction
of the health risk in tropical marine waters with a very low level of FIB,
where epidemiological studies found no consistent relationship between water quality and cases of illness. More recently, again Soller
et al. (2017) harmonized QMRA and epidemiological investigations for
temperate marine waters (California, USA), in order to calculate the
incidence of GI illness following wet weather recreational exposures
among surfers. These authors found that QMRA results for NoV exposure were in accordance with the illness risk calculated by an epidemiological study among surfers, carried out by Arnold et al. (2017) in
the same bathing location.

infections between 2005 and 2006. The studies by Schijven et al. (2013)
and Sterk et al. (2015) also investigated Vibrio spp., in order to understand the effect of climate change on the increase in the risk of vibrio
infection during warm summer seasons.
Except for the cytotoxigen E. coli, the choice of reference pathogens
does not take into account the different strains. Given that pathogenicity and infectivity are often strain-dependent, this can be a limitation
in the reliability of the estimations, as explained below.
3.3.2. Exposure assessment
In a classical QMRA framework, the dose is calculated as a product
between the concentration of the pathogen at the point of exposure and
the volume of bathing waters ingested.
3.3.2.1. Concentration of pathogen(s). In the majority of papers (42,
77.8%), the QMRA is based on pathogen measurements in recreational
waters. In most of such waters, data were specifically collected for the
QMRA study, in others, data were derived from previously published
surveys related to the same bathing area (Boehm et al. (2015); Brown
et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fuhrimann et al., 2016; Schets et al., 2011; Sterk
et al., 2016; Schijven et al., 2013; Soller et al., 2010b) and in others, the
data came from surveillance programs (Lim et al., 2017; Pintar et al.,
2010; Timm et al., 2016).
The low concentrations of pathogens associated with the generally
low recovery efficiencies of detection methods represent a critical issue
(Teunis and Havelaar, 2000). Consequently, some authors (12, 22.2%)
prefer a “discharge-based QMRA” which uses data on pathogens detected in discharges-of-concern in proximity to recreational waters (i.e.
rivers, storm waters, wastewater treatment plants, CSOs). In this case,
pathogen concentrations at the point-of-exposure were calculated assuming a conservative dilution factor from the water discharge to
bathing site, which was point-estimated (Adell et al., 2016; McBride
et al., 2013) or modeled as a probability distribution (Soller et al., 2017;
Viau et al., 2011). Other studies used a hydrodynamic model to infer
pathogen levels from discharges to the site-of-exposure (Andersen et al.,
2013; Chapman et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2016; Seto et al., 2016; Sterk
et al., 2016; Whelan et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2018a). An advantage of
the discharge-based approach is the possibility of evaluating the interventions or peak events, which a “point-of-exposure” QMRA is not
able to perform.
In all cases, when data on the field measurements of pathogens are
used, the recovery efficiency of the detection method and viability of
the pathogen should be taken into account (Haas et al., 2014; WHO,
2016). A correction factor for infectivity is recommended for pathogens
measured with biomolecular assays (mainly viruses), or with microscopy (protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium) because these methods do not differentiate between infectious vs noninfectious agents. Only a few QMRA papers adjusted pathogen concentrations for recovery efficiency and/or infectivity (16, 29.6%), as
reported in Table 1 (additional references for Table 1 are listed in
Appendix 3 of the Supplementary Information).
Ten papers took into account the recovery efficiency using different
approaches. A few studies (4) estimated the recovery efficiency for the
sampling method with experiments on natural spiked samples
(Betancourt et al., 2014; Adell et al., 2016; Kundu et al., 2013; McBride
et al., 2013). Xiao et al. (2018b) used distilled waters as a spiked
sample. In other studies, the authors used the percentage of recovery
efficiency from previously published papers, considering either a pointestimate (Girardi et al., 2019; Timm et al., 2016) or the distributions
derived from data reported in the literature (Lapen et al., 2016; Pintar
et al., 2010; Van Abel et al., 2017). The remaining six studies in Table 1
did not consider the recovery efficiency in the dose calculation, implicitly assuming a 100% value.
Fourteen of the papers in Table 1 included infectivity in the dosecalculation. In most of these papers, the values were acquired from the
literature, and only two studies provided study-specific infectivity data

3.2.8. Evaluating the impact of control measures on health risk
The QMRA provides a framework for estimating the expected impact of an intervention on disease rates based on scientific data regarding how well each treatment removes or inactivates human enteric
pathogens (Petterson, 2016). Nevertheless, in the context of bathing
waters, only a few studies (2) have applied a QMRA to evaluate the
potential public health benefits associated with management options
regarding recreational water impacted by a single source. Chapman
et al. (2018) evaluated the efficacy of sanitary interventions on a cattle
farm, in a hypothetical scenario of river waters impacted by a single
animal-source. Xiao et al. (2018a) analyzed the removal efficiency of a
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharging into a river used for
bathing purposes.
3.3. Different approaches to QMRA steps and related issues
3.3.1. Hazard identification
In the majority (52 papers, 96.3%) of the reviewed QMRA studies,
the risk was calculated from exposure to one or more pathogens included in the set of “reference pathogens” identified by US EPA (2010).
These are the microorganisms responsible for a large proportion of nonfoodborne illnesses in the USA, and have been studied in relation to
survival, fate and transport in external environments (Mead et al.,
1999; Scallan et al., 2011), and finally their dose-response relations are
known: Norovirus, Rotavirus, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Cryptosporidium
spp., Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and E. coli
O57:H7. Where available, the selection of reference pathogens for
QMRA is based on previous epidemiological studies or serological investigations, represented by the incidence of illnesses in the general
population, or in the population of concern (Andersen et al., 2013).
Other inclusion criteria for reference pathogens are the concentration in
wastewaters (Eregno et al., 2016), the survival in natural waters, the
type of contamination sources (human, livestock, birds), the infectivity,
the availability of detection methods for viruses/bacteria/parasites, and
the relation between pathogen occurrence and study scenarios (i.e.,
climate change) (Schijven et al., 2013; Sterk et al., 2015, 2016).
Epidemiological studies and surveillance programs represent the
best source of data for the identification of the main etiological agents
of recreational waterborne illnesses, specific for a geographical area. In
fact, some QMRA papers (8, 14.8%) have focused on other pathogens,
when in a specific study area epidemiological data were available and
gave information on the particular leading cause of the observed GI
illness. In other cases, information on pathogen were collected from
monitoring surveys on WWTP that revealed the occurrence of specific
pathogens in sewage pollution. In South Africa QMRA studies included
Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae and Hepatitis A Virus
(Teklehaimanot et al., 2015; Abia et al., 2016), in China Mycobacterium
avium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Cui et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2018)
and in Uganda Ascaris lumbricoides (Fuhrimann et al., 2016). In the
USA, Dickinson et al. (2013) focused on pathogenic vibrios, based on
the evidence of several recreational-related waterborne vibrio

for a more precise health risk estimation in the bathing location under
investigation (Betancourt et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2018b). The majority
of literature-based infectivity data came from clinical trials where pathogens were measured with cultural assays, while in the environment
at present the most commonly used methods are bio-molecular.
Therefore, dose-harmonization factors were used in some of the reviewed studies. For example, published dose-response models for HAdV
are expressed in TCID50 (Couch et al., 1966; Teunis et al., 2016), while
HAdV is generally detected with qPCR in water samples. Thus, in the
reviewed QMRA studies, the concentration of HAdV genome copies was
corrected by a factor estimated as 1:700 (infectious viruses vs genome
copies) (Bambic et al., 2011) on the basis of a single study (He and
Jiang, 2005) on primary treated sewage which found a ratio of 1:1000
between PFU and genome copies, further corrected to TCID50, applying
a factor of 0.7 derived from a study by Dulbecco in 1988 (Dulbecco,
1988). The numerous approximations used in the calculations and with
no account taken of their variability, this infectivity correction factor is
not reliable for estimating infectious HAdV. Nevertheless, to date, it is
the only one used for QMRA (McBride et al., 2013; Kundu et al., 2013;
Vergara et al., 2016).
In addition, experimental studies have reported that the ratio between infectious viruses and genome copies can differ based on the
environmental matrix, and the combination of primers and probes used
during the analytical test, as reported by Prez et al. (2015).
The estimation of infectivity is also an issue for uncultivable viruses,
such as NoV. Although they are quantified in genomic copies both in
environmental and clinical studies, the genetic target sequences may
diverge. In the studies reviewed, only two papers addressed this issue,
applying an adjustment factor of 18.5, based on differences in the critical threshold standard curves of RT-PCR (McBride et al., 2013; Timm
et al., 2016).

activities. There are few water ingestion studies on swimmers in
natural recreational waters, thus in most of the papers analyzed (21)
swallowed water volume was derived from a study by Dufour et al.
(2006) on volunteers in an outdoor pool setting during a 45 min period
of swimming. To assess the volume of water ingested, the authors
performed a chemical testing based on the measurement of
chloroisocyanurates (CYA) as tracers measured in both pool water
and the urine of participants (cyanuric acid is traditionally used to
stabilize chlorine in the swimming pools). They reported an average
volume of water swallowed by adults of 16 mL (ranging between 0 and
53 mL), which reached 37 mL for children (ranging between 0 and
153 mL).
In the reviewed QMRA studies, the results of Dufour et al. (2006)
were used as a point estimate by Soller et al. (2010b, 2014, 2016),
Pintar et al. (2010), Oster et al. (2014), Eregno et al. (2016), and Lapen
et al. (2016). Schoen and Ashbolt (2010) used Dufour's pilot study as a
guide and modeled the accidentally ingested water volume during
swimming as a log-normal distribution with μ = 2.92 and σ = 1.43,
with a median value of the distribution of 19 mL, estimated from a
combined population of children and adults. In the reviewed studies,
several authors followed this approach: Vergara et al. (2016), Liao et al.
(2016), Soller et al. (2010a, 2015, 2017), Whelan et al. (2014), Seto
et al. (2016), Viau et al. (2011), Staley et al. (2012), Boehm et al.
(2015), Ahmed et al. (2018), and Brown et al. (2017a). Also Goh et al.
(2015) considered the variability in the ingested volume assessed by
Dufour et al. (2006), and thus this parameter was randomly sampled
between the maximum and minimum values, for both adults and children.
Dufour and colleagues updated their results (Dufour et al., 2017),
increasing the sample size from 53 to 549 participants, finding that
swimmers accidentally ingest much more water than previously assessed, with 32 mL/h for adult swimmers. These results were included
in the more recently reviewed QMRA papers (Brown et al., 2017b; Xiao
et al., 2018b).
The estimated swallowed volumes of water from these studies could
be considered appropriate for freshwater swimmers, however they are
not suitable for marine water swimmers due to the different swimming
conditions.
Other exposure parameters defined in a study by Schets et al. (2011)
conducted both in swimming pools and untreated bathing waters (fresh
and coastal waters) in The Netherlands were used in nine of the reviewed papers. Schets et al. performed a descriptive survey through
questionnaires, in combination with a test to measure mouthfuls of
water for the transformation of categorical data to numerical data on
swallowed volumes of water, and provided average swallowed volume
per swimming event of 31 mL, 27 mL and 18 mL for children, men and
women, respectively. Such volumes were therefore modeled as gamma
distributions, with different parameters according to age and gender. In
the reviewed studies, some authors referred to Schets et al. (2011) in
considering the different levels of exposure based on age or gender
(Fuhrimann et al., 2016; Schijven et al., 2013; Sterk et al., 2015, 2016;
Rodrigues et al., 2016). Although Schet's study was conducted specifically in natural recreational waters, these results refer to Northern
Europe, and swimmers' behaviour is difficult to generalize to an area
with different climate conditions, such as the Mediterranean, in terms
of volumes swallowed and time spent in the water. In fact, water
temperature in the North Sea ranges between approximately 10 and
20 °C, with an average of 18 °C (Schets et al., 2011), compared to water
temperatures in excess of 25 °C during the summer season in the
Mediterranean Sea (ISPRA, Stato dell'ambiente 76/2017).

3.3.2.2. Estimation of pathogens through indicators. To overcome the
limitations posed by the low concentration of pathogens and the
analytical difficulties, some authors have performed QMRA based on
FIB using an appropriate conversion ratio to obtain pathogen
concentrations. The use of FIB (coliforms, E. coli, and intestinal
enterococci) to estimate pathogens is reported in the current WHO
guidelines on QMRA (WHO, 2016), highlighting several advantages. In
fact, FIB can be easily measured, and their concentrations can be
obtained from online databases as a result of routine monitoring by
environmental protection agencies. Another advantage is that the risk
can be characterized for different pathogens using the same bacterial
indicator by simply modifying the conversion ratio from indicator to
pathogen. This approach has been adopted in some studies (8, 14.8%),
which are summarized in Table 2 (additional references for Table 2 are
reported in Appendix 3 of the Supplementary Information).
The use of indicator organisms to estimate pathogen concentrations
in bathing waters has been challenged due to the variability of enteric
pathogens in the environmental matrices attributable to seasonal fluctuations in the endemic microbial population (Carducci et al., 2009)
and the prevalence of enteric infections in the community. Moreover,
this approach to the dose calculation is based on the assumption that
the pathogen to indicator ratios are constant in similar fecal discharges
or recreational waters. However, the indicator to pathogen ratio can
vary temporarily and spatially, according to the level of environmental
pollution. For example, Verani et al. (2019) calculated different ratios
between fecal indicators (EC, IE, and somatic coliphage) and HAdV
along hydrological systems, and found different relationships from
wastewater effluents to seawaters. The use of conversion ratios has
therefore introduced further variability and uncertainty in the QMRA
estimates, above all in the case of waters affected by different sources of
fecal contamination (human and non-human) and for pathogens subjected to seasonal variations (O'Toole et al., 2014).

human challenge experiments (clinical trials); alternatively outbreak
data can be used (Haas et al., 2014).
Currently, clinical trials still rely on a limited volunteer population
(generally healthy males) and the tested pathogen strain/s. Moreover,
the exposure methods may be inadequate to represent the exposure to
environmental samples. As regards outbreak data, the majority of
available cases involve only one type of transmission exposure, which is
generally foodborne as reported by Teunis et al. (2010). In the reviewed
studies, dose-response relationships were derived from different human
feeding studies on various types and strains of microorganisms, which
were pooled in various ways to yield different dose-response models.
For this reason, in Table 3 different dose-response models are reported
for each enteric pathogen (additional references for Table 3 regarding
key dose-response studies are listed in Appendix 3 of the Supplementary
Information).
Dose-response relationships obtained under controlled conditions
are affected by variations related to the genetic difference in pathogens
infecting the same host, to the host susceptibility to infection by the
same pathogen, and finally to the exposure pathways. In addition, the
type of pathogen inoculum used during human trials should be taken
into account. Each of these aspects is addressed in detail below.

Campylobacter derived from outbreaks due to the consumption of
different types of contaminated food (e.g. cakes, ice cream, eggs).
QMRA studies for Vibrio parahaemolyticus used the dose-response
relationship based on outbreak data for oyster consumption
(Dickinson et al., 2013; Sterk et al., 2015). These relationships
involve the assumption of very high doses compared to the expected
dose from environmental exposure, and thus may not be suitable for the
swallowing of bathing waters, because the lack of data at low doses
introduces uncertainties in the risk estimation.
Concerning HAdV, the studies published before 2016 exploited a
dose-response model based on inhalation exposures to HAdV4. This
model was developed by Couch et al. (1969) and subsequently adapted
for water ingestion by Crabtree et al. (1997). Teunis et al. (2016) developed a “generalized” model that combines dose-response information from clinical trials with volunteers exposed to various types of
adenoviruses (HAdV4, HAdV7, HAdV16), in order to better estimate
the risk of gastrointestinal illness from oral ingestion. This model is
more suitable for recreational water exposure than the previous one,
and thus makes QMRA studies more reliable for risk estimation from
waterborne HAdV (Ahmed et al., 2018).
3.3.3.4. Type of inoculum in clinical trials. As regards NoV, during
clinical trials the dose of pathogen is prepared volumetrically from
suspensions, and can be administrated as aggregated or non-aggregated
inoculum. Aggregation factors for the virus can significantly influence
the risk estimation, as demonstrated by Van Abel et al. (2017) for NoV.
These authors attempted to draw the complete picture of NoV health
risk using multiple models (two types of aggregated models and two
disaggregated models) and obtained high variations in the probability
of illness form one model to another. Nevertheless, in the absence of a
standard approach to the NoV dose–response model selection, the most
commonly used model in the reviewed papers was by Teunis et al.
(2008) which assumes no aggregation in the recreational waters, due to
the lack of knowledge of virus aggregation dynamics in surface waters.
Soller et al. (2017) and Brown et al. (2017b) tried to overcome this
problem by using the two dose-response equations for NoV in
conjunction: a non-aggregated hypergeometric model by Teunis et al.
(2008) to estimate the upper bound of predicted illness risk, and an
aggregated fractional model by Messner et al. (2014) for the lower
bound. However, the drawback of this approach is a predicted NoV risk
with a large uncertainty range compared to the other pathogens (Soller
et al., 2017). Concerning protozoan parasites such as Giardia, the doseresponse equation is based on a feeding study by Rendtorff (1954) in
which the author administrated the cysts isolated from infected humans
to volunteers, but without testing the viability of the cysts in vitro
before inoculation. This therefore introduced uncertainties surrounding
the viability of the cysts, and thus about the real correlation between
infective Giardia and health outcomes.

3.3.3.1. Type of strain or species. As reported in Table 3, numerous
dose-responses are available for each index pathogen, based on
different clinical trials. Some of them do not consider all the
infectious strains for humans, thus providing different equation
parameters. For example, Teunis et al. (2009) inferred the doseresponse curve for Cryptosporidium by interpreting the data on the
infectivity of several C. parvum isolates, without including C. hominis,
which is, in turn, infectious for humans. In addition, Rendtorff (1954)
conducted the only clinical study which was subsequently used by other
authors (Rose et al., 1991; Teunis et al., 1996) to infer the doseresponse equation for Giardia. Rendtorff used only one G. duodenalis
strain and a relatively small sample population, thus the variety of
other G. duodenalis strains are not represented in the dose-response
parameters. The same considerations are valid for HAdV because the
dose-response relationship widely used in the reviewed QMRA studies
is based on a clinical trial by Couch et al. (1969) for exposure to
HAdV4, thus the serotypes responsible for gastroenteritis (i.e.,
HAdV40/41) are not taken into consideration.
3.3.3.2. Exposed population. Dose-response models are generally
developed on the basis of clinical trials carried out only on healthy
adults, and not considering sensitive populations (i.e. immunocompromised, children and the elderly), for which the risk is
underestimated. Only a few dose-response studies have considered a
variation in the dose-response parameters among hosts, taking into
account the difference in the immune status in relation to a specific
pathogen (Teunis et al., 2002) or different responses according to age
on the basis of outbreak data (Teunis et al., 2004). In all the reviewed
QMRA studies, the separation of the risk characterization according to
age is based exclusively on different levels of exposure (ingestion rate or
duration of bathing) rather than the different dose-response functions
for adults and children. Xiao et al. (2018b) represent an exception,
because they used the same dose-response model, but separated the
risks for children and adults using different values of infectious
parameters.

3.3.4. Risk characterization
In the risk characterization, the information from previous steps
(hazard identification, exposure and dose–response assessment) is
gathered in order to determine the probability of infection/illness. The
main issues are the variability and uncertainty of the input data:
variability is defined as the natural variation in the phenomenon of
interest, and uncertainty represents the lack of knowledge regarding the
phenomenon (Hamilton et al., 2006; Sunger and Haas, 2015). In the
risk characterization the most influential input parameters can also be
identified through a “sensitivity analysis”, which tests the relative impact of the stochastic variables on the results of the model.

3.3.3.3. Transmission route. For some pathogens, the dose-response
data for water ingestion are not available, because there is a lack of
clinical trials involving exposure through oral ingestion or data on
recreational waterborne outbreaks. Some of the reviewed QMRA
studies therefore used dose-response models derived from feeding
trials or foodborne outbreaks, thus referring to an exposure different
from accidental swallowing of recreational waters. For example, Brown
et al. (2017a, 2017b) used a dose-response equation for Salmonella and

3.3.4.1. Variability. Sources of QMRA variability are represented by
detection methods, spatial-temporal modifications in microbial density,
and variations in ingested volume across individuals, which impact on
the variability of dose calculation; other sources include secondary
transmission rates and immunity, which are responsible for the
346

I. Federigi, et al.

variability in health outcomes. The sources of variability can be taken
into account within a QMRA framework using stochastic models, where
key input parameters are modeled as probability density functions, and
results are calculated using a Monte Carlo Analysis. On the other hand,
deterministic models are unable to consider the inherent variability
because each parameter is represented by a single value (point
estimates), which are generally either the mean or the modal value of
a series of datasets (i.e. average or median pathogen density obtained
from monitoring).
Most of the reviewed studies (45, 83.3%) applied stochastic models,
usually used to capture the variability in pathogen concentrations, and
the volume of water ingested. In the studies considering the recovery
efficiency of analytical methods and the infectivity of pathogens, some
authors also included these parameters as stochastic variables (Corsi
et al., 2016; Lapen et al., 2016; Pintar et al., 2010; Van Abel et al.,
2017). Models that take into account the variability in health outcomes
include secondary transmission and immunity and are termed “dynamic”, while models assessing health risks only at the individual level
are defined as “static”. All the studies followed a static approach and
therefore did not consider this source of variability. This was justified
by Soller and Eisenberg (2008) who found that the simpler static model
provides satisfactory risk estimates under low risk conditions as in recreational exposures.

4. Discussion
The topic of QMRA for recreational waters has appeared in the
scientific literature since 2003, and the geographical origin of the studies we reviewed highlights the worldwide interest in QMRA applied to
recreational waters, covering inland and marine waters, in tropical or
temperate environments. The number of QMRA on recreational waters
has been increasing exponentially in the last 15 years, with a great
variety of approaches and applications.
The majority of studies have focused on inland waters; in fact that
inland waters are more polluted than marine waters because of their
lower capacity for self-renewal (EEA, 2018). Nevertheless, numerous
marine bathing areas suffer from a high level of fecal pollution, because
they receive contaminated waters from point and non-point sources
(Federigi et al., 2017).
Besides the focus on different health risks based on age and gender,
the most frequent QMRA aims of the reviewed papers concerned the
estimation of risk based on different pathogens, hazardous events, and
recreation activities.
From this perspective, QMRA complements epidemiological studies,
which are time-consuming and financially demanding (Yillia et al.,
1999) and are mainly restricted to beaches impacted by a single
sewage-source of pollution (Fujioka et al., 2015). For example, Soller
et al. (2010b) deduced that NoV was the etiological agent of the vast
majority of illnesses at the freshwater sites impacted by human contamination. To lend credence to the use of QMRA, some authors have
tried to anchor QMRA results to epidemiology findings where epidemiological data were available. For example, in Australia, Ashbolt and
Bruno (2003) performed a QMRA assuming that the aetiology of illnesses was viral, and that viruses had an exponential dose-response
model. They found a good fit between the QMRA results and empirical
GI illness based on UK epidemiological studies. Soller et al. also found a
good agreement between QMRA estimates and the empirical illness
cases reported by epidemiological studies at tropical (Soller et al.,
2016) and temperate (Soller et al., 2017) marine beaches. However, in
developing countries the risks estimated by QMRA did not match so
well with the reported illness cases, with a much higher estimated risk
by QMRA than the empirical measurements by epidemiology (Diallo
et al., 2008; Yajima and Koottatep, 2010). This could be explained by
the lack of validation of QMRA models in developing countries, where
recreational waters are only one of the exposure scenarios investigated,
and health risks are posed by various water uses.
In addition, various papers focused on the sources of water pollution, both as source apportionment and as MST markers interpretation.
Some authors found that human sewage poses a greater risk to swimmers than animal fecal pollution (Soller et al., 2010a; Schoen and
Ashbolt, 2010), with the exception of GI illness risks associated with
exposure to recreational waters directly impacted by fresh cattle feces
which is similar to waters impacted by humans (Soller et al., 2010a).
These results highlight the potential applicability of SA-QMRA to develop site-specific water quality criteria based on FIB for waters that are
impacted by different fecal contamination sources (Soller et al., 2014,
2015). In terms of MST-QMRA, the reviewed papers that interpreted the
HF183 concentration agree with each other: a benchmark illness rate of
three cases of illness per 100 swimmers occurred at a median concentration of ∼103 HF183 copies/100 mL of recreational waters affected by sewage (Ahmed et al., 2018; Boehm et al. (2015); Brown
et al., 2017b).
The examination of variability and uncertainty and the application
of sensitivity analyses highlighted the predominant variables in the risk
estimation. Generally, the most significant variable was the pathogen
concentration. Where the annual risk was taken into account, the exposure frequency was the predominant factor (Fang et al., 2018;
Fuhrimann et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018b). In studies that evaluated the
impact of control measures, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that
the pathogen removal efficiency of the treatment facility was one of the

3.3.4.2. Uncertainty. Sources of QMRA uncertainty include the
parameters of dose-response relations, because they are developed on
the basis of clinical trial data on healthy adult males exposed to only
one strain of a pathogen species, while the dose-response can vary
depending on age and gender, or from one microbial strain to another.
Among the reviewed studies, Corsi et al. (2016) tried to consider
uncertainty in a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. They computed one simulation in the variability dimension (ingestion rate,
swimming time, genome copies and infectivity of the pathogen) and
another simulation in the uncertainty dimension by drawing the doseresponse parameter values from empirical continuous (Salmonella spp.,
C. jejuni) or uniform (enterovirus) distributions. Also, Xiao et al.
(2018a, 2018b) accounted for the uncertainty in dose-response parameters of protozoan parasites, using a lognormal (Xiao et al., 2018a)
then a beta (Xiao et al., 2018b) distribution to describe the infectivity
constant of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp.
3.3.4.3. Sensitivity. In our review, 21 studies (38.8%) applied a
sensitivity analysis to the predicted pathogen doses, such as pathogen
concentration, swimming duration, and the amount of water ingested
during swimming activities. The sensitivity analysis was conducted
using two main computational approaches. In 8 out of 21 (38.1%)
QMRA papers, a rank order correlation sensitivity analysis was applied
by calculating a coefficient between the model output (estimated risk)
and each selected input parameter, in order to obtain a correlation
measure ranging from −1 to 1 (Adell et al., 2016; Corsi et al., 2016;
Kundu et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2016; Pintar et al., 2010; Schoen and
Ashbolt, 2010; Xiao et al., 2018a, 2018b). In 9 out of 21 (42.9%)
papers, a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was used, which is a simple
univariate method, where the selected individual inputs vary over a
range of plausible values based on the literature results (or empirical
distribution), while holding all other inputs fixed at their nominal
values (Brown et al., 2017a, 2017b; Eregno et al., 2016; Fang et al.,
2018; Fuhrimann et al., 2016; Schijven et al., 2013; Soller et al., 2010b;
Soller et al., 2015; Viau et al., 2011). The remaining four studies
performed a sensitivity analysis with a different approach from those
described above (Soller et al., 2010a, 2014, 2017; Grace et al., 2012).
For example, in two studies by Soller et al. a sensitivity analysis was
performed to understand the impact of different dose-response
parameters on the final result for C. jejuni (Soller et al., 2014) and
NoV (Soller et al., 2017).

Moreover, all the above-mentioned studies should be planned specifically for QMRA purposes, from the environmental sampling of discharges or receiving waters (Verani et al., 2019) to the harmonization
of pathogen concentrations between environmental monitoring and
human challenge studies (McBride et al., 2013).

most influential factors (Brown et al., 2017b; Xiao et al., 2018a).
4.1. Strengths and limitations of the current review
One of the main strengths of this review was that we searched the
literature thoroughly, without any temporal restrictions. Nevertheless,
the exclusion of conference papers and non-English language articles
could have led us to exclude some relevant studies. Moreover, limiting
the search criteria to those papers which explicitly discuss bathing or
recreational waters, likely resulted in the non-appearance of the papers
related to recreation in different types of waters, such as source water
reservoirs.
Another strength was that we used the recommended PRISMA
guidelines. In addition, the screening process by two review authors
potentially reduced the chance of errors related to the inclusion of
studies in the qualitative and quantitative analyses and data extraction.
One limitation was the heterogeneity concerning QMRA approaches, different contexts, and objectives. For example, not all studies
considered the exposure to several pathogens in evaluating the cumulative health risk. There was also a lack of complete and uniform input
data necessary to run the QMRA models, especially in terms of recovery
efficiency and infectivity.
Despite these limitations, we are confident that this review represents the state of art concerning the application of QMRA to natural
recreational waters.

This work was supported by CCM project n° 2S62 “support for the
implementation of risk analysis in potable and bathing waters and
management of the water portal information system” (12/12/2017–11/
12/2018), realized with the financial support of the Ministry of Health
– CCM (Centro nazionale per la prevenzione e il Controllo delle
Malattie). Specific objective of this project was “pilot study using
Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) according to WHO
guidelines, applied to bathing water”.

5. Conclusions
The findings from our review show that QMRA can be used as a tool
for the following purposes: characterizing various exposure scenarios,
understanding the differences in risks posed by various types of FIB
sources, interpreting epidemiological results, developing alternative
recreational water quality criteria and evaluating the impact of control
measures on health risk.
The use of QMRA is thus very promising for management of recreational waters and as a mean to improve the regulations.
Nevertheless, further research is still needed to improve the reliability
of the QMRA results, from the perspective of routine recreational water
risk assessment.
The main research gaps identified from our analysis of the studies
are:

1. A lack of epidemiological data on the main pathogens of concern in
specific geographical areas;
2. A lack of site-specific water quality data for many pathogens. In fact,
numerous studies performed QMRA on literature-based data, which
may not be suitable in terms of microbial contamination in the study
area under investigation;
3. Little consideration of the recovery efficiency of the detection
methods during dose-calculation. Also, in the case of studies aimed
at interpreting MST markers (their recovery efficiency was not taken
into account in the reviewed studies);
4. A lack of dynamic QMRA models for adults with regular exposure to
recreational waters, such as surfers who may have acquired a higher
immune status than the general adult population;
5. A lack of human challenge trials specifically for recreational exposure and for different population groups, according to age,
gender, immunological status. The aim should be to appropriately
represent the accidental ingestion of waters during swimming, also
taking into account children, women, and the immunodeficient
populations, who all exhibit different dose-response features compared to the classical healthy male volunteers, on which the doseresponse studies have been conducted to date;
6. A lack of studies aimed at reconciling dose-response curves with
epidemiological studies, as carried out by Soller et al. (2017).
