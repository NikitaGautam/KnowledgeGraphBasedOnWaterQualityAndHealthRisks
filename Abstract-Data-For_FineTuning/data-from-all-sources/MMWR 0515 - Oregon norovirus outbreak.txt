Healthy and Safe Swimming Week
— May 18–24, 2015
May 18–24, 2015, marks the 11th annual Healthy and
Safe Swimming Week (formerly known as Recreational
Water Illness and Injury Prevention Week). This observance
highlights ways in which swimmers, parents, pool owners and
operators, beach managers, and public health can maximize
the health benefits of water-based physical activity, while
minimizing the risk for recreational water–associated illness
and injury. More information is available at http://www.cdc.
gov/healthywater/observances/hss-week/index.html.
This year’s theme, “Make a Healthy Splash: Share the Fun,
Not the Germs,” focuses on a few easy and effective steps
swimmers and parents can take to protect themselves and
their families and friends from infectious pathogens in pools,
waterparks, hot tubs, spas, and water playgrounds. These steps
are highlighted in CDC’s new Healthy Swimming brochure,
available with other free promotional materials at http://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/resources/index.html.
CDC also released the 1st Edition of the Model Aquatic
Health Code in August 2014 (1), a voluntary guidance
document that can help state and local authorities and the
aquatics sector make swimming and other water activities
healthier and safer. The first Conference for the Model
Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC) will be held October 6–7,
2015, in Scottsdale, Arizona, where CMAHC members*
can vote on potential MAHC changes. A public health communications toolkit for Healthy and Safe Swimming Week is
available at http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/observances/

In July 2014, Multnomah County public health officials
investigated a norovirus outbreak among persons visiting
Blue Lake Regional Park in Oregon. During the weekend
of the reported illnesses (Friday, July 11–Sunday, July 13)
approximately 15,400 persons visited the park. The investigation
identified 65 probable and five laboratory-confirmed cases of
norovirus infection (70 total cases). No hospitalizations or
deaths were reported. Analyses from a retrospective cohort study
revealed that swimming at Blue Lake during July 12–13 was
significantly associated with illness during July 13–14 (adjusted

relative risk = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1–64.9).
Persons who swam were more than twice as likely to become
ill compared with those who did not swim in the lake. To
control the outbreak, Blue Lake was closed for 10 days to
prevent further illness. This investigation underscores the
need for guidance for determining when to reopen untreated
recreational water venues (e.g., lakes) associated with outbreaks,
and communication tools to inform the public about the risks
associated with swimming in untreated recreational water
venues and measures that can prevent illness.
On July 14, Multnomah County Health Department
(MCHD) was notified of 13 cases of acute gastrointestinal
illness among members of three separate groups who had
visited Blue Lake Regional Park over the previous weekend,
July 11–13. MCHD began to investigate the potential outbreak
to identify risk factors for illness, and develop and implement
control measures to prevent additional illness.
The park, located just outside of Portland (Multnomah
County), is a popular destination for city residents during the
summer. The park has a lake for swimming, picnic grounds,
paddleboats, and a splash pad (a chlorinated spray ground with
features that shower and pour water). During the weekend of
the reported illnesses, approximately 1,700 persons visited the
park on Friday, July 11; 7,700 on Saturday, July 12; and 6,000
on Sunday, July 13, thousands more visitors compared with
an average summer weekend.

Epidemiologic Investigation
To control the outbreak, Blue Lake was closed for 10 days
to prevent other illness. Telephone interviews of both ill and
non-ill persons were conducted as part of a retrospective cohort
study using contact information for persons on the reservations
list for the park picnic grounds during the weekend of interest,
July 11–July 13. Persons who had made the reservations
were contacted by MCHD and asked to provide contact
information for up to eight persons in their group; 139 persons
were identified. State and Portland metro-area local health
departments (Clackamas, Clark, Multnomah, and Washington
counties) interviewed 109 (78%) of the 139 persons. A
probable case was defined as any vomiting or diarrhea with
onsets 7–45 hours after visiting the park, in a person who
visited the park on July 11, 12, or 13. A confirmed case was
defined as meeting the probable case definition and having
laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection. Because this was a
high profile outbreak and was heavily covered in the media,
MCHD received 52 additional reports of illness from persons
who contacted MCHD and other local health departments
with symptoms consistent with norovirus infection but they
were not included in the retrospective cohort study because
they were not identified through the reservation list. The
investigation identified 65 probable and five laboratoryconfirmed cases of norovirus infection (70 total cases).
In the cohort study, approximately 17% (18 of 109) of
participants met the case definition; 10 (56%) reported having

any diarrhea and 14 (78%) reported vomiting. The median
incubation period was 31 hours (range = 7–45 hours), and the
median duration of illness was 10 hours (range = 4–24 hours).
However, at the time of their interview, three persons reported
that their symptoms had not yet resolved. No hospitalizations
or deaths were reported.
The percentage of visitors who were at the lake on Saturday,
July 12 and became ill was 25% (17 of 68 persons) (Figure).
Only one person who visited the lake on Sunday became ill,
and no Friday visitors became ill. Those who became ill were
significantly younger than those who were not ill (Table 1).
Swimming (including immersion under water or wading in
the lake), using the splash pad, boating, and younger age (aged
4–10 years) were each significantly associated with becoming ill
in bivariate analyses (Table 2). However, when all of these risk
factors were assessed simultaneously in one logistic regression

The mechanism by which the lake became contaminated is
unknown; however, a swimmer’s vomit or fecal incident in the
lake over the weekend, probably on Saturday, July 12, could
explain the point source outbreak pattern (Figure).

Laboratory Testing
Five ill persons provided stool specimens, which all tested
positive for norovirus genogroup I by polymerase chain
reaction. These specimens also tested negative for Salmonella,
Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Campylobacter.

Environmental Health Investigation
Blue Lake, just south of the Columbia River, is a natural
lake, about 25 feet (7.6 m) at its deepest, but about half of the
lake, including the swimming area, is 10 feet (3.0 m) deep or
less. The beach area itself is a small area, approximately 300
feet long by 30 feet wide (91.4 m by 9.1 m). The water along
the beach is shallow. Bubblers were installed in the swimming
area to circulate water from the center of the lake into the
swimming area. Before the outbreak, the bubblers were in
operation and were working as designed. The lake is monitored
for fecal contamination twice-weekly during May–September.
MCHS was notified of a high E. coli result from the shallow
swimming area at Blue Lake on July 16. The E. coli count was
304, above the safety threshold of 235. A follow-up sample,
collected on July 17, did not violate Oregon water quality
standards. Samples collected from July 14 were also below
the threshold and considered safe, as were samples leading
up to the outbreak. The laboratory does not conduct species
identification tests. The positive test is a general indicator of

488

MMWR / May 15, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 18

fecal contamination, of which an animal or human could be
the source. Because the timing of the fecal coliform elevation
occurred after the outbreak, this spike in fecal contamination
was determined to be unrelated to the norovirus outbreak. Blue
Lake Regional Park is on a sewage system versus a septic tank
system. Multnomah County Environmental Health conducted
an evaluation of the park after notification of illness and did
not find any signs of failure of the sewage system. Blue Lake
uses well water for watering the large land area, but uses a
public water source for drinking water and for their facilities.
Blue Lake proactively closed the beach to swimming,
paddleboat, and fishing activities from Monday, July 14 until
Wednesday, July 23; however, the picnic grounds and splash
pad remained open during this period. On July 23, MCHD
and the Oregon Public Health Division sampled lake water
by pumping approximately 90 L from different areas of the
swimming area through each of two hollow-fiber ultrafilters
(1). Two samples (100 mL each) were also collected for E. coli
testing. Ultrafilter samples were sent to CDC, which reported
on July 30 that the samples had negative results for norovirus
using real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing (2). E. coli
concentrations in the tested samples were below state and
federal ambient water quality standards.
Discussion

On the basis of symptom profiles, illness incubation and
duration periods, and positive stool specimens, norovirus
(a human pathogen) was the likely etiology of this outbreak.
On the basis of the statistically significant epidemiologic link
to swimming in Blue Lake, the lake was likely the outbreak



Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

What is already known on this topic?
Nationally and internationally, norovirus outbreaks have been
associated with untreated recreational water venues, such as
lakes. During 2009–2010, the most recent years for which
finalized data are available, there were 81 recreational water–
associated disease outbreaks, 24 of them associated with
untreated recreational water.
What is added by this report?
In July 2014, a norovirus outbreak associated with Blue Lake
Regional Park in Oregon affected 70 persons. Swimming in the lake
was significantly associated with illness; thus, the lake was closed
for 11 days to swimming, paddleboat, and fishing activities.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health officials could greatly benefit from guidance for
determining when to reopen untreated recreational water
venues associated with outbreaks and public-facing health
communication resources that promote healthy swimming and
prevent recreational water–associated illness.

source.* Although, the mechanism by which the lake became
contaminated is unknown, the most likely cause, based on
the point source outbreak pattern, was a swimmer’s vomit
or fecal incident in the lake over the weekend, probably on
Saturday, July 12. If a swimmer had a vomit or fecal incident
in the lake on Saturday, July 12, the illness counts, by day of
visit to the lake, suggest that the bubblers might have helped
limit transmission to primarily Saturday, July 12 via dilution.†
During the previous 15 years, Blue Lake has been the source
of other acute gastrointestinal illness outbreaks during the
summer months. In 1991, Blue Lake was linked to a dualpathogen outbreak (21 cases of E. coli O157:H7 and 59 cases
of Shigella infection). In 2004, norovirus caused an outbreak
associated with swimming in Blue Lake; this outbreak affected
>100 persons (3,4). In addition, in the summer months Blue
Lake often closes because of the presence of blue-green algae
that can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals.
Because of the small beach area and the sheer numbers of park
visitors, the bather load was high the weekend of the outbreak
exposure. The effects of high bather load were likely exacerbated
by the high temperatures (upwards of 90°F or 32°C), the
potentially poor water circulation within the beach area, and
the fact that shallow beach areas attract young children, among
whom norovirus is the leading cause of medically attended acute
gastroenteritis in the United States (5,6). Children also can be
* The water, and thus the tested samples, might have no longer been contaminated
by norovirus 11 days after Saturday, July 12, or the contamination levels in the
samples might have fallen below the level of detection.
† Based on the hypothesis that a swimmer had a vomit or fecal incident in the
lake on Saturday, July 12, and 17 of 18 illnesses occurred in persons who
visited the lake Saturday, but only one illness occurred in a person who visited
the lake on Sunday.

at higher risk for exposure because they are more likely to ingest
water while swimming (7). In addition, there is no method
to chemically treat the lake, allowing contamination and the
potential of transmission to persist.
Because there are no evidence-based remediation steps for
untreated recreational water venues as there are for treated
recreational water venues (e.g., pools), public health officials
found it challenging to come to a clear consensus on when
to reopen the lake. There is evidence that noroviruses can
survive in water for several months and possibly years (8).
Consequently, MCHD relied on commonsense strategies
(e.g., waiting multiple incubation periods to ensure illness had
subsided) and the expertise of health officers to decide when
to reopen the lake. Public health agencies could benefit from
the development of evidence-based criteria to determine when
to reopen untreated recreational water venues associated with
outbreaks (e.g., venue-specific water quality regression models).
Preventing and controlling such outbreaks also calls for
engaging the swimming public, who represent a key source of
recreational water contamination. Blue Lake has policies in
place to prevent high-risk situations, including biweekly water
testing for fecal contamination, installing bubblers to increase
water circulation, and banning children aged <5 years§ from the
beach area to limit vomiting and fecal incidents in the water,
policies which existed before the outbreak. However, these
strategies alone cannot eliminate the risk of contamination
of recreational water, and more proactive (i.e., pre-outbreak)
dissemination of messages that promote healthy swimming
are needed. Because of the disproportionate reporting of
outbreaks associated with treated recreational water venues,
CDC has historically focused on developing healthy swimming
promotion resources for treated venues.¶ However, as this
outbreak highlights, healthy swimming promotion resources
for untreated recreational water venues are also needed. Such
resources would need to balance raising awareness of the
health benefits of aquatic-based physical activity and outdoor
recreation with informing the swimming public of steps that it
can take to minimize potential risks of swimming in untreated
recreational water (9). To optimize the effectiveness of healthy
swimming messages specific to untreated recreational water
venues, public health experts need to better understand how the
swimming public perceives these venues and their associated
risk of infection, particularly given the communal nature
of swimming. Thus, understanding the public’s knowledge,
attitudes, and practices surrounding untreated recreational
water could be the first step to preventing illness.
§ CDC

does not recommend banning children aged <5 years from recreational
water venues as a strategy to prevent recreational water–associated illness outbreaks.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

Decrease in Rate of Opioid Analgesic Overdose Deaths —
Staten Island, New York City, 2011–2013
Denise Paone, EdD1, Ellenie Tuazon, MPH1, Jessica Kattan, MD1, Michelle L. Nolan, MPH1, Daniella Bradley O’Brien1, Deborah Dowell, MD2,
Thomas A. Farley, MD3, Hillary V. Kunins, MD1 (Author affiliations at end of text)

From 2000 to 2011, the rate of unintentional drug poisoning (overdose) deaths involving opioid analgesics increased
435% in Staten Island, from 2.0 to 10.7 per 100,000 residents.
During 2005–2011, disparities widened between Staten Island
and the other four New York City (NYC) boroughs (Bronx,
Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens) (1); in 2011, the rate
in Staten Island was 3.0–4.5 times higher than in the other
boroughs. In response, the NYC Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) implemented a comprehensive
five-part public health strategy, with both citywide and Staten
Island–targeted efforts: 1) citywide opioid prescribing guidelines, 2) a data brief for local media highlighting Staten Island
mortality and prescribing data, 3) Staten Island town hall
meetings convened by the NYC commissioner of health and
meetings with Staten Island stakeholders, 4) a Staten Island
campaign to promote prescribing guidelines, and 5) citywide
airing of public service announcements with additional airing
in Staten Island. Concurrently, the New York state legislature
enacted the Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing
(I-STOP), a law requiring prescribers to review the state
prescription monitoring system before prescribing controlled
substances. This report describes a 29% decline in the opioid
analgesic–involved overdose death rate in Staten Island from
2011 to 2013, while the rate did not change in the other four
NYC boroughs, and compares opioid analgesic prescribing data
for Staten Island with data for the other boroughs. Targeted
public health interventions might be effective in lowering
opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality rates.
In NYC, the rate of opioid analgesic–involved overdose deaths
increased 57% from 2005 to 2011, from 2.1 to 3.3 per 100,000
residents. While rates increased citywide, the rate in Staten
Island increased 257% during the same period, from 3.0 to
10.7 per 100,000 residents (Figure). In April 2011, DOHMH
reported citywide opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality,
highlighting the disproportionately high rates in Staten Island
(2). This report received substantial media coverage, particularly
among Staten Island local news outlets. In November 2011,
DOHMH published opioid prescribing guidelines for general
medical providers with the following key messages: 1) a 3-day
supply of short-acting opioid analgesic is usually sufficient for
acute pain, 2) avoid prescribing opioid analgesics for chronic
noncancer pain, 3) avoid high-dose opioid analgesic prescriptions, and 4) avoid prescribing opioid analgesics to patients

taking benzodiazepines (3). In January 2013, DOHMH released
opioid prescribing guidelines for emergency departments (4) that
were adopted citywide by 39 emergency departments, including
both of Staten Island’s hospitals.
Throughout 2013, DOHMH met in Staten Island with local
hospital, addiction treatment, and syringe exchange programs,
as well as local politicians to share overdose mortality trends
and guidelines. In June 2013, the commissioner of health
held two conferences for Staten Island physicians on judicious
opioid prescribing. These guidelines were promoted to Staten
Island prescribers via one-to-one office educational visits in
which DOHMH recommendations, resources, and tools were
disseminated. During 2012–2014, DOHMH aired two television
advertisements highlighting the risks of opioid analgesics citywide,
with additional airtime in Staten Island. These interventions
occurred in close temporal proximity to the enactment and media
coverage of I-STOP, state legislation implemented in August 2013
that requires providers to consult the state Prescription Monitoring
Program, a registry of controlled-substance prescriptions filled by
New Yorkers, before prescribing or dispensing Schedule II, III, or
IV controlled substances.
To evaluate the impact of the public health interventions,
DOHMH assessed changes in unintentional opioid analgesic–
involved overdose mortality rates and changes in opioid analgesic
prescribing patterns. Mortality data were derived from two
linked sources, NYC death certificates and toxicology findings
from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Deaths were
defined as unintentional drug poisoning (overdose) if the medical
examiner determined manner of death as accidental and the
underlying or multiple cause code was assigned an ICD-10 code
of X40–X44, F11–F16, or F18–F19 (excluding F-codes with
0.2 or 0.6 third digit). Toxicology metabolites were abstracted
from medical examiner files and linked to death certificate data.
Toxicology findings were used to describe the drugs involved
in overdose deaths. Methadone-involved overdose deaths
were reported separately, because there are approximately
30,000 New Yorkers maintained on methadone for opioid use
disorders. Staten Island opioid analgesic–involved overdose
rates were compared with the other four NYC boroughs
combined. Overall, overdose rates also were assessed to
determine whether changes in opioid analgesic–involved
overdose rates were offset by changes in other drug poisonings,
principally heroin.

Data for opioid analgesic prescriptions filled by NYC residents
were derived from the New York State Prescription Monitoring
Program. DOHMH assessed median day supply and the fill rates of
prescriptions and high morphine equivalent–dose prescriptions (>100
morphine milligram equivalents) (5) by borough of patient residence.
Age-adjusted rates were calculated using NYC population
estimates for the period 2000–2013 and the U.S. Census 2000
standard population. To evaluate the impact of the public health
interventions, prescription rates were compared annually and for
the fourth quarters (October–December) during 2011–2013.
Given that both office educational visits with Staten Island
prescribers and implementation of I-STOP occurred in the third
quarter of 2013, the fourth quarter of 2013 was compared with
the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012. Rate changes were tested
using z-tests and 95% confidence intervals; comparisons were
based on gamma confidence intervals distribution (6).
From 2000 to 2011, Staten Island residents had the
highest rate of opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality

492

MMWR / May 15, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 18

in NYC. From 2005 to 2011, the rate increased 257% in
Staten Island, compared with a 44% increase in the other
four boroughs combined. After implementation of the public
health initiatives, opioid analgesic mortality rates decreased
29% from 2011 to 2013, from 10.7 to 7.6 per 100,000
Staten Island residents (Table 1). In comparison, the rate for
the other four boroughs combined did not change from 2011
to 2013 (2.6 per 100,000 residents, for both years). Among
Staten Island residents, the rate of heroin-involved overdose
deaths fluctuated but had a net increase of 39% from 2011 to
2013, from 6.2 in 2011 to 8.6 per 100,000 residents in 2013.
Among the other four boroughs combined, heroin-involved
overdose deaths increased 35% during the same period (from
3.7 in 2011 to 5.0 per 100,000 residents in 2013). In Staten
Island, overall drug-involved overdose deaths decreased 4%
from 2011 to 2013, from a rate of 18.4 to 17.6 per 100,000
residents. During that period, the rate for the other four
boroughs increased 20%, from 7.9 to 9.5 per 100,000.
The median day supply for filled opioid analgesic
prescriptions for Staten Island residents was unchanged during
2011–2013 (30 days). In contrast, the median day supply for
the other four boroughs was lower, but increased from 2011
to 2013, from 15 to 20 days (Table 2).
In 2011, Staten Island residents filled opioid analgesic
prescriptions at a higher rate (502.0 per 1,000 residents) than
did residents of the other four boroughs (236.7) and filled
high-dose prescriptions at rates three times higher (132.4)
than residents of the other boroughs (40.7) (Table 2). In 2012,
the rate of opioid analgesic prescriptions filled decreased in all
boroughs, whereas rates of high-dose prescriptions increased
slightly. Compared with 2011, in 2013 the opioid analgesic
prescriptions fill rate continued to decrease for residents of
all boroughs, by 9.8% in Staten Island (to 452.9 per 1,000
residents) and by 8.2% (to 217.2) elsewhere. The rate of
high dose prescriptions decreased 8.2% (to 121.6 per 1,000
residents) in Staten Island while increasing 4.7% (to 42.6) in
the other four boroughs. The decrease in Staten Island rates of
high dose prescriptions continued in the final quarter of 2013.
Discussion

After implementation of targeted and general public health
initiatives, Staten Island saw 2 years of decreases in opioid
analgesic high-dose prescribing and opioid analgesic–involved
overdose mortality; the decreases followed 11 years of increases.
In contrast, high-dose prescribing in the other four NYC
boroughs increased without changes in opioid analgesic–
involved overdose mortality rates. In addition, the decreases
in opioid analgesic overdoses on Staten Island were not offset
by increases in heroin-involved overdose mortality.

Decreases in opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality
have been reported from Wilkes County, North Carolina (7),
Utah (8), Washington (9), and Florida (10). Each county or
state employed a tailored strategy or combination of strategies
to address opioid analgesic–involved overdose deaths, most of
which included policy and clinical interventions. NYC employed
both a general and geographically targeted approach, similar to
Wilkes County, aiming to reach the entire NYC population and
all prescribers, but found decreased mortality only in the targeted
Staten Island area that received the most intensive interventions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three
limitations. First, although decreases were observed in both
high-dose prescribing and opioid analgesic–involved mortality
rates, it is not known whether decedents had taken prescribed
or nonprescribed opioids, nor at what doses. Both decreases
might be attributed to decreased risk for persons prescribed
opioids or a decrease in the amount of opioids available for
diversion to nonprescribed use. Second, law enforcement
efforts to decrease the supply of diverted opioids or to reduce
malpractice were not considered, although these efforts
occurred during the period of the public health interventions.
Finally, although the public health interventions were followed
by a reduction in opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality
rates in Staten Island, it is not possible to determine the extent
of each intervention’s contribution to the decline.
Despite limitations, the fact that some of the initiatives were
statewide or citywide (I-STOP, prescribing guidelines, and
public service announcements), whereas others were Staten
Island–specific (local media, local community engagement and
conferences, tailored advertising messages, and office educational
visits with prescribers) suggests that the community-specific

What is known already?
Opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality is a serious
public health issue. In New York City, the rate of opioid
analgesic–involved overdose deaths increased 57% citywide,
from 2005 to 2011. However, in one borough, Staten Island, the
rate increased 257% during that period.
What is added by this report?
This report shows that data-driven, multi-pronged public health
strategies, including judicious prescribing guidelines, office
educational visits with providers, dissemination of timely data
reports, and media campaigns, might contribute to a reduction
in the rate of opioid analgesic–involved overdose deaths in
Staten Island.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Targeted public health interventions appear effective in
lowering opioid analgesic–involved overdose mortality rates;
the interventions in Staten Island might be replicated by other
health departments.

initiatives might have been key to the decreases in Staten Island
without corresponding decreases citywide. Staten Island’s size
(500,000 pop.) and relative geographic separation from the other
four NYC boroughs also might have enhanced its saturation with
prevention messages and strategies. This tailored and intensive
approach might be effective in other jurisdictions with high rates
of opioid analgesic–involved mortality.

Foodborne illnesses represent a substantial, yet largely
preventable, health burden in the United States. In 10 U.S.
geographic areas, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance
Network* (FoodNet) monitors the incidence of laboratoryconfirmed infections caused by nine pathogens transmitted
commonly through food. This report summarizes preliminary
2014 data and describes changes in incidence compared with
2006–2008 and 2011–2013. In 2014, FoodNet reported
19,542 infections, 4,445 hospitalizations, and 71 deaths.
The incidence of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli
(STEC) O157 and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium
infections declined in 2014 compared with 2006–2008,
and the incidence of infection with Campylobacter, Vibrio,
and Salmonella serotypes Infantis and Javiana was higher.
Compared with 2011–2013, the incidence of STEC O157
and Salmonella Typhimurium infections was lower, and the
incidence of STEC non-O157 and Salmonella serotype Infantis
infections was higher in 2014. Despite ongoing food safety
efforts, the incidence of many infections remains high, indicating that further prevention measures are needed to make food
safer and achieve national health objectives.
FoodNet conducts active, population-based surveillance
for laboratory-confirmed infections caused by Campylobacter,
Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Listeria, Salmonella, Shiga
toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 and nonO157, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia in 10 geographic areas
covering approximately 15% of the U.S. population (an
estimated 48 million persons in 2013). FoodNet is a collaboration among CDC, 10 state health departments, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection
Service (USDA-FSIS), and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Hospitalizations occurring within 7 days of specimen collection are recorded, as is the patient’s vital status at
hospital discharge or 7 days after specimen collection if the
patient was not hospitalized. Hospitalizations and deaths that
occur within 7 days of specimen collection are attributed to
the infection. Surveillance for physician-diagnosed postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome, a complication of STEC
infection characterized by renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and
* Additional information available at http://www.cdc.gov/foodnet.

microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, is conducted through a
network of nephrologists and infection preventionists and by
hospital discharge data review. This report includes hemolytic
uremic syndrome data for persons aged <18 years for 2013,
the most recent year for which data are available.
Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of laboratory-confirmed infections in 2014 by U.S. Census estimates
of the surveillance area population for 2013. † Incidence
of culture-confirmed bacterial infections and laboratoryconfirmed parasitic infections (e.g., identified by enzyme
immunoassay) are reported. A negative binomial model with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used to estimate changes in
incidence from 2006–2008 to 2014 and from 2011–2013 to
2014. Change in the combined overall incidence of infection
with six key foodborne pathogens§ was estimated. For STEC
non-O157, because of changing diagnostic practices and testing methods, only change in incidence since 2011–2013 was
assessed; for Cyclospora, change was not assessed because data
were sparse. For hemolytic uremic syndrome, 2013 incidence
was compared with that in 2006–2008. The number of reports
of positive culture-independent diagnostic tests without corresponding culture confirmation is reported for Campylobacter,
Salmonella, Shigella, STEC, and Vibrio. Incidence calculations
do not include culture-independent diagnostic test reports.

Cases of Infection, Incidence, and Trends
In 2014, FoodNet identified 19,542 cases of infection, 4,445
hospitalizations, and 71 deaths (Table). The number and
incidence per 100,000 population were as follows: Salmonella
(7,452 [15.45]), Campylobacter (6,486 [13.45]), Shigella (2,801
[5.81]), Cryptosporidium (1,175 [2.44]), STEC non-O157
(690 [1.43]), STEC O157 (445 [0.92]), Vibrio (216 [0.45]),
Yersinia (133 [0.28]), Listeria (118 [0.24]), and Cyclospora
(26 [0.05]). The percentage of infections associated with
outbreaks was as follows: STEC O157 (16%), Listeria (11%),
STEC non-O157 (7%), Shigella (7%), Salmonella (6%),
† Final

incidence rates will be reported when population estimates for 2014 are
available.
§ The overall incidence of infection combines data for Campylobacter, Listeria,
Salmonella, STEC O157, Vibrio, and Yersinia, six key bacterial pathogens for
which >50% of illnesses are estimated to be transmitted by food.

¶ No national health objective exists for these pathogens.

Vibrio (6%), Cryptosporidium (5%), Yersinia (0.8%), and
Campylobacter (0.6%).
Among 6,565 (88%) serotyped Salmonella isolates in 2014,
the number and incidence per 100,000 population of the
top six serotypes were as follows: Enteritidis (1,401 [2.90]),
Typhimurium (806 [1.67]), Newport (724 [1.50]), Javiana
(639 [1.32]), I 4,[5],12:i:- (381 [0.79]), and Infantis (235
[0.49]). Among 208 (96%) speciated Vibrio isolates, 131
(63%) were V. parahaemolyticus, 27 (13%) were V. alginolyticus,
and 19 (9%) were V. vulnificus. Among 546 (79%) serogrouped
STEC non-O157 isolates, the top serogroups were O26 (31%),
O103 (24%), and O111 (19%).
Compared with 2006–2008, the 2014 incidence was significantly lower for STEC O157 (32% decrease; CI = 18%–43%)
and Yersinia (22% decrease; CI = 1%–39%) infections, higher
for Vibrio (52% increase; CI = 22%–89%) and Campylobacter
(13% increase; CI = 5%–21%) infections, and not significantly
changed for other pathogens (Figure 1). Among the six most
commonly identified Salmonella serotypes, the incidence was
significantly lower in 2014 for Typhimurium (27% decrease;
CI = 18%–35%) compared with 2006–2008, but significantly
higher for Infantis (162% increase; CI = 100%–244%) and
Javiana (131% increase; CI = 83%–191%). Incidence for the
three serotypes with significant changes in 2014 was calculated
for the period 2006–2014 (Figure 2). Compared with 2011–
2013, the 2014 incidence was significantly lower for STEC
O157 and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium infections and
higher for STEC non-O157 and Salmonella serotype Infantis
infections. The overall incidence of infection with the six key
foodborne pathogens was not significantly different from either
of the comparison periods.

In 2013, a total of 87 cases of postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic
syndrome were reported among children aged <18 years (0.79
cases per 100,000). Of these, 46 (53%) occurred in children aged
<5 years (1.55 cases per 100,000). The incidence of hemolytic
uremic syndrome was not significantly different than during
2006–2008 for either age group. No deaths were reported.
In addition to culture-confirmed infections (some with
positive culture-independent diagnostic test results), there
were 1,597 reports of positive culture-independent diagnostic
tests that were not confirmed by culture, either because a culture did not yield the pathogen or because the specimen was
not cultured. These reports were not included in the overall
count of cases. Among 1,070 Campylobacter reports in this
category, 553 (52%) had no culture, and 517 (48%) were
culture-negative. Among 146 STEC reports, 62 (42%) had
no culture, and 84 (58%) were culture-negative. The Shiga
toxin–positive result was confirmed for 65 (48%) of 135
broths sent to a public health laboratory. The other reports of
positive culture-independent diagnostic tests where culture was
negative or not performed were of Salmonella (193), Shigella
(186), and Vibrio (two).
Discussion
In 2014, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed Shiga
toxin–producing E. coli O157 and Salmonella serotype
Typhimurium infections was significantly lower than during
2006–2008, whereas the incidence of Campylobacter, Vibrio,
and Salmonella serotypes Javiana and Infantis infections was
higher. Compared with 2011–2013, incidence of STEC
non-O157 and Salmonella serotype Infantis infection was
significantly higher.

The decrease in the incidence of STEC O157 infections
could be attributable to several factors related to food safety
efforts. Today, because isolates are routinely sent to public
health departments for subtyping by PulseNet,¶ and epidemiologists rapidly investigate clusters of illnesses in which bacteria
have similar DNA fingerprints, the sources of outbreaks are
identified faster than in the past, which allows contaminated
products to be removed from the marketplace before more

pathogens.

persons become ill. The most common sources of STEC O157
infection are beef and leafy vegetables (1). After STEC O157
was declared an adulterant in ground beef in 1994, public
health officials identified many STEC O157 outbreaks that
resulted in ground beef recalls. Substantial changes in beef
industry practices and government policy** led to a decrease
in ground beef contamination (2). Contamination of ground
beef with STEC O157 has decreased.†† Producers of leafy
vegetables have also made improvements after a large outbreak
in 2006 (3). It is also possible that a portion of the decrease is
related to the increasing use of culture-independent diagnostic
tests without confirmatory culture.
The increasing incidence of non-O157 STEC infections
is attributable, in part, to an increase in the number of laboratories testing for Shiga toxin and, consequently, increased
recognition of non-O157 STEC infections (4). Six serogroups
(O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) are considered
adulterants in non-intact beef products or the components of
these products. In 2012, USDA-FSIS began testing for nonO157 STEC in domestic and imported beef manufacturing
trimmings.§§
Salmonella serotypes are diverse in reservoirs and sources. The
unchanged overall incidence of salmonellosis masks substantial
changes in infection with individual serotypes. Typhimurium,
the most common serotype reported to FoodNet until 2009,
has contaminated a wide variety of food sources, including
cattle and poultry. The incidence of Typhimurium infections
nationwide has been declining since the mid-1980s, for reasons
that are unclear (5). An analysis of outbreak data from 1998
to 2008 estimated that 34% of Typhimurium infections were
related to consumption of poultry (1). Decreases in contamination of whole chickens with Salmonella serotype Typhimurium,
as reported by USDA-FSIS¶¶ (Kristin Holt, USDA-FSIS;
personal communication, 2013–2014 data, 2015), might
have contributed to the decline. In July 2011, USDA-FSIS
tightened the performance standards for Salmonella on poultry carcasses, and, in December 2013, released an action plan
to decrease contamination in regulated products.*** Poultry
vaccines against Salmonella have been used increasingly, first

in egg-laying flocks, and to a lesser extent in broiler breeder
flocks.††† Salmonella serotype Javiana infection is concentrated
in southeastern states; the number of counties with annual
infection rates above one case per 100,000 both inside and outside the southeast has increased markedly since the 1990s (5).
Additional regulations and ongoing industry efforts are
likely to improve food safety. In January 2015, USDA-FSIS
proposed new pathogen-reduction performance standards for
Salmonella and Campylobacter in comminuted (reduced to
minute particles) chicken and turkey products as well as raw
chicken parts, such as chicken breasts, thighs, and wings.§§§
In 2015, FDA plans to publish regulations for safer produce,
processed foods, and imported foods, as mandated by the Food
Safety Modernization Act (6). Vaccination of breeder poultry
flocks, in combination with biosecurity measures, has been
shown to reduce contamination of poultry meat (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four
limitations. First, increasing use of culture-independent tests
by clinical laboratories might affect the number of cultureconfirmed infections reported; culture-independent testing
might increase (as observed for STEC non-O157 infections)
or decrease (because fewer cases might be diagnosed through
traditional methods) reported incidence (8). Second, health
care–seeking behaviors and other characteristics of the population in the surveillance area might affect the generalizability
of the findings. Third, the proportion of illnesses transmitted
by nonfood routes differs by pathogen; data provided in this
report are not limited to infections from food. Finally, changes
in incidence between periods can reflect year-to-year variation
during those periods rather than sustained trends, and the
number of infections and patterns observed might change as
final data become available.
Progress has been made in decreasing contamination of
some foods and reducing illness caused by some pathogens.
However, little or no recent reductions for most infections
have occurred. For example, Campylobacter and Vibrio rates are
still higher than during 2006–2008, a pattern also observed in
2013 (9). More information is needed to understand sources
of infection and changes in incidence, and to help determine
where to target prevention efforts.

What is already known on this topic?
The incidence of many foodborne infections, including
Salmonella, has been largely unchanged for many years.
Salmonella infection is a complicated problem because infection
can be acquired by many types of foods and from nonfood
sources, so many different control methods are needed.
What is added by this report?
The 2014 data show progress in reducing infections from
Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium.
However, the incidence of infection with Salmonella serotypes
Infantis and Javiana has increased.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Infections caused by E. coli serogroup O157 declined after
targeted interventions to reduce contamination of ground beef
were implemented. Similarly, to reduce the incidence of
Salmonella infection, serotype-specific approaches are required.
Public health, regulatory agencies, industry, and consumers can
all play a role.

As one of the three West African countries highly affected by
the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic, Liberia
reported approximately 10,000 cases (1). The Ebola epidemic
in Liberia was marked by intense urban transmission, multiple
community outbreaks with source cases occurring in patients
coming from the urban areas, and outbreaks in health care
facilities (HCFs) (2,3). This report, based on data from routine case investigations and contact tracing, describes efforts
to stop the last known chain of Ebola transmission in Liberia.
The index patient became ill on December 29, 2014, and the
last of 21 associated cases was in a patient admitted into an
Ebola treatment unit (ETU) on February 18, 2015. The chain
of transmission was stopped because of early detection of new
cases; identification, monitoring, and support of contacts in
acceptable settings; effective triage within the health care system; and rapid isolation of symptomatic contacts. In addition,
a “sector” approach, which divided Montserrado County into
geographic units, facilitated the ability of response teams to
rapidly respond to community needs. In the final stages of the
outbreak, intensive coordination among partners and engagement of community leaders were needed to stop transmission
in densely populated Montserrado County. A companion
report describes the efforts to enhance infection prevention
and control efforts in HCFs (4). After February 19, no additional clusters of Ebola cases have been detected in Liberia.*
On May 9, the World Health Organization declared the end
of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.

Evolution of the Cluster
The index patient in this cluster was a woman aged 50 years
who became ill on December 29, 2014, in a community near
St. Paul River Bridge in Montserrado County (Monrovia).
After seeking care from an herbalist in her community, the
patient presented to an HCF on January 4 with high fever, red
eyes, and cough. Ebola was suspected, but she refused referral
to an ETU and was sent home with antibiotics and antipyretics. On January 5, she was admitted to an ETU and died later
that day. A postmortem swab of oral fluids tested positive for
Ebola virus by polymerase chain reaction. Her family reported
* Another single case occurred in a person who received a diagnosis of Ebola on
March 20, 2015, and was not connected to this cluster (5).

MMWR / May 15, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 18

no known contact with other Ebola patients, although other
Ebola cases had been reported in the same neighborhood.
In addition, before her illness, the woman had traveled to
Grand Cape Mount County, where Ebola virus transmission
was ongoing.
Over the following 7 weeks, 21 additional persons with
laboratory-confirmed Ebola were linked to this case: 11 family
members, six neighbors, two community members, one health
care worker, and an herbalist (Figure 1). These cases occurred
in three generations, all epidemiologically linked to the index
case. The time interval from onset of illness to admission
to an ETU decreased with each generation of cases. Twenty
patients (including the index patient) received treatment at
an ETU, including 13 patients who died. The two associated
Ebola-infected persons who did not seek care in an ETU died
in the community. Five first-generation patients were admitted to an ETU on average 6.0 days (range = 2–11 days) after
illness onset. Ten second-generation patients averaged 4.7 days
(range = 1–11 days) from symptom onset to ETU admission
or death in the community. The six third-generation patients
averaged 1.5 days (range = 0–4 days) from symptom onset to
ETU admission (Table). The case-fatality rates among the successive generations were 100%, 60%, and 50%, respectively.
Probable transmission for 18 of the cases (86%) occurred
within 1 kilometer of St. Paul River Bridge in Montserrado
County, whereas transmission for three cases occurred near
Red Light, 15 kilometers southeast of St. Paul River Bridge
(Figure 2).
Five patients worked in an HCF, three as cleaners (1A,
2C, and 3D) and two as health care providers (3A and 3C).
However, the cleaners and one health care provider (3A) had
significant household exposures with persons with confirmed
Ebola that could account for their infection (Figure 1). One
patient (1B) traveled to Red Light while symptomatic, became
incapacitated in the community, and exposed two persons
(2E and 2I) who assisted him into a taxi. One of these men
later exposed patient 3C, a health care provider working in
Red Light.
According to information provided by patients or their family during case investigations, several symptomatic patients
sought care in counties outside of Montserrado to conceal

Margibi County and became infected while caring for him.
At least eight patients sought care at non-ETU HCFs before
their Ebola diagnosis in nine facilities in Montserrado County
and one in Margibi County, exposing a total of 166 health
care workers (4).
In several instances, challenges with HCF triage contributed
to missing patients with suspect or probable Ebola. One patient

consistent with appendicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease,
received care at two clinics and was hospitalized at a third facility
for 7 days before being transferred to an ETU. A symptomatic,
high-risk contact (3C) under daily monitoring, presented for
care at an ETU but was sent home despite a history of exposure
to body fluids of a confirmed Ebola patient because his temperature was <100.4°F (<38.0°C). Two days later, he presented
with symptoms at the non-ETU HCF where he worked and
was sent to an ETU, where Ebola was confirmed.
Contact tracing identified 745 contacts for this cluster over
the 6-week period, including the 166 health care workers from
10 HCFs (4). During the response to this cluster, considerable

502

MMWR / May 15, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 18

efforts were made to address the needs of high-risk contacts
(e.g., those with documented exposure to body fluids of persons
with confirmed Ebola). In some instances, contacts agreed
to home-based quarantine, and groups of contacts agreed
to facility-based observation (i.e., direct daily symptom and
temperature monitoring in an HCF), where they could be
immediately isolated if symptoms developed, without risk of
community transmission. Incomplete contact tracing contributed to the persistence of this cluster; only 15 (68%) of the
cases were in persons listed as known contacts; 60% of first- and
second-generation and 100% of third-generation cases were
in persons who were known contacts (Table). Several patients
in the cluster denied Ebola symptoms or exposure to persons
with confirmed Ebola when seeking care, reportedly because

What is already known on this topic?
During the initial phases of the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease
(Ebola) epidemic in Liberia, there was intense urban transmission, multiple community outbreaks with source cases occurring in patients coming from the urban areas, and outbreaks in
health care facilities.
What is added by this report?
The last cluster of Ebola in Liberia included 22 cases, with three
generations of transmission. Through enhanced control efforts,
patients in successive generations were admitted to Ebola
treatment units more quickly, mortality decreased, and
community transmission was interrupted.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The last chain of transmission was controlled because of
successful implementation of known strategies to control Ebola,
including early detection of new cases; identification, monitoring, and support of contacts in acceptable settings; effective
triage within the health care system; and rapid isolation of
symptomatic contacts.

of fear of community stigma and apprehension of ETUs. At
least one child (1D) was hidden from contact tracers when they
visited. Persons who initially presented to non-ETU HCFs
were less likely to be listed as contacts; two (25%) of eight
persons who initially presented to non-ETUs were known
contacts, compared with 13 (93%) of 14 who first presented
for care at an ETU. Although guidance called for immediate
isolation of symptomatic contacts, nine (75%) known contacts
were isolated ≥2 days after symptom onset. The last confirmed
case in this cluster (3F) was in a person admitted to an ETU
on February 18 and discharged on March 5. The last clusterassociated contacts who did not become ill exited monitoring
on March 11.
Discussion

This network of Ebola transmission in Liberia illustrated
numerous challenges that persisted throughout the epidemic:
fear of stigmatization in the community, delays in seeking treatment, inadequate triage in HCFs, lack of recognition of Ebola
cases, and incomplete identification and follow-up of some
contacts. The motivations for denying Ebola symptoms and
resisting treatment are complex, but include stigma, fear, and
denial related to possible Ebola infection, mistrust of ETUs,
and low medical literacy. Despite the widespread availability
of ETUs in Montserrado County, some persons opted for care
at distant ETUs or care in non-ETU settings, where, consequently, large numbers of health care workers were exposed.
Delayed treatment might have contributed to worse outcomes
in the first two transmission generations compared with the
last generation, when patients sought care more promptly.

Triage systems did not fully prevent Ebola patients from being
admitted to HCFs rather than ETUs. Despite these challenges,
the last cluster of Ebola in Liberia was controlled because of
successful implementation of known effective Ebola control
strategies, including early detection of new cases; identification, daily monitoring, and support of contacts in acceptable
settings; effective triage within the health care system; and
rapid isolation of symptomatic contacts (2,3).
To improve case investigations and contact tracing,
Montserrado County had coincidentally decentralized management of outbreak activities in the four geographic sectors.
This decentralized, “sector” approach might have reduced the
risk for community transmission. Each geographic sector had
multidisciplinary teams led by coordinators located in each
sector to manage and coordinate outbreak response activities
at the sector, zone, and block level. Sector teams were empowered to make decisions related to control activities locally, and
this enabled flexible adaptation of accepted outbreak control
principles to fit local circumstances. Strategies included the use
of home-based and community quarantine and facility-based
observation, with provision of basic needs and psychosocial
support, active case-finding, and outreach to religious and
community leaders to allay the fears of affected households
and community members. Although decentralization of sector
management presented initial communication and coordination challenges, the enhanced sector-based efforts resulted
in more complete contact tracing, more prompt isolation of
symptomatic patients in the second and third generations of
transmission, increased survival, and reduced transmission in
the community.
As the threat of Ebola wanes, much needed non-Ebola
health services are resuming in Liberia. However, comprehensive triage for Ebola (3) and appropriate personal protective
equipment are crucial but cannot completely eliminate risk for
Ebola transmission at HCFs. At least eight cases in the cluster
described in this report were in patients who sought care at
non-ETU HCFs; six (75%) of these were not listed as contacts,
highlighting the critical importance of comprehensive contact
tracing. These eight patients were treated by HCFs despite the
universal requirement of triage. At least four patients in this
cluster did not have fever when presenting for care; some HCFs
and contact tracers used lack of fever as a de facto indicator to
rule out Ebola (i.e., rather than completing a comprehensive
triage), highlighting the limitations of temperature-based
triage. Conversely, many non-Ebola patients had illnesses
that met the case definition but could not be tested without
transfer to an ETU, where care for their non-Ebola medical
conditions would not be offered. Despite these challenges, only
one of the exposed health care workers in this cluster became
infected with Ebola, and no additional transmission occurred

in HCFs, possibly because of timely, targeted infection prevention and control training and provision of personal protective
equipment (4). Additionally, the most recent Ebola patient
was appropriately triaged to an ETU when she presented to a
non-ETU HCF (5).
In contrast to earlier in the Ebola epidemic, sector-based intensified contact tracing and in-depth case investigation, widespread
infection prevention and control efforts (3), and coordination
of case investigation and contact tracing activities between
Montserrado and other counties (6) were key to stopping this
final chain of Ebola transmission. The risk for re-introduction of
Ebola into Liberia will remain high as long as transmission continues in the region. National efforts to strengthen surveillance,
alert and response, border screening, and triage and infection
prevention and control in HCFs are high-priority activities in
the government of Liberia’s recovery plan.

From mid-January to mid-February 2015, all confirmed Ebola
virus disease (Ebola) cases that occurred in Liberia were epidemiologically linked to a single index patient from the St. Paul
Bridge area of Montserrado County (1). Of the 22 confirmed
patients in this cluster, eight (36%) sought and received care from
at least one of 10 non-Ebola health care facilities (HCFs), including clinics and hospitals in Montserrado and Margibi counties,
before admission to an Ebola treatment unit. After recognition
that three patients in this emerging cluster had received care
from a non-Ebola treatment unit, and in response to the risk
for Ebola transmission in non-Ebola treatment unit health care
settings (2), a focused infection prevention and control (IPC)
rapid response effort for the immediate area was developed to
target facilities at increased risk for exposure to a person with
Ebola (Ring IPC). The Ring IPC approach, which provided
rapid, intensive, and short-term IPC support to HCFs in areas of
active Ebola transmission, was an addition to Liberia’s proposed
longer term national IPC strategy, which focused on providing a
comprehensive package of IPC training and support to all HCFs
in the country. This report describes possible health care worker
exposures to the cluster’s eight patients who sought care from
an HCF and implementation of the Ring IPC approach. On
May 9, 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the end of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.*

St. Paul Bridge Cluster
The eight Ebola patients who sought care from an HCF
ranged in age from 10 to 56 years; three were female. Only
two of the eight were on a contact tracing list of persons with
known prior Ebola exposure when they went to the HCF. Two
patients died in the community and were never admitted to
an Ebola treatment unit. For the other six, a median of 1 day
passed (range = 0–9 days) between the first visit to an HCF
and their admission to an Ebola treatment unit. For three
patients with available data, a fever (defined as a temperature
>100.4°F [>38°C] taken with an infrared thermometer) was
not recorded on arrival at the HCF. Of the eight patients, seven
subsequently died from Ebola.
* Additional information available at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/
statements/2015/liberia-ends-ebola/en/.

Overall, 166 non-Ebola treatment unit health care workers in 10 HCFs possibly were exposed to the eight Ebola
patients (Figure). The nature of their possible exposures
varied, including providing treatment or performing laboratory tests on blood specimens of Ebola patients, or cleaning
a room or mattress where an Ebola patient had slept. All 166
were placed on contact lists. Of these, 86 (52%) were placed
under home-based quarantine or precautionary observation at
an HCF because of relatively higher risk exposures, while the
remainder were monitored by contact tracers, either at home
or at their place of employment (Figure). One clinic was closed
entirely (clinic D) (Figure) during the postexposure period of
observation, and one inpatient section of a hospital was closed
(hospital D) (Figure). One health care worker developed Ebola
after debriding and suturing the lacerations of an Ebola patient
who had sought care for treatment of injuries sustained in a
fight, and both the patient and the health care worker died.
None of the other 165 health care workers developed Ebola.
Observations of the 10 HCFs found that health care worker
exposures could have occurred for multiple reasons. Triage
systems were inadequate with limited or no triage or isolation
structures, no use or inappropriate use of infrared thermometers, limited ability to elicit accurate contact exposure history, and an incomplete understanding of the case definition
(suspected or probable) by some staff members. Additional
challenges included no use or inappropriate use of personal
protective equipment, insufficient staff to support IPC activities, and inconsistent oversight by IPC partners.

Ring IPC Strategy
Ring IPC was a collaboration of the Liberian Ministry of
Health National and Montserrado Incident Management
Systems, Montserrado and Margibi county health teams, CDC,
WHO, the African Union, and nongovernmental organization
partners under the Liberia IPC Task Force. On January 30,
members of the IPC Task Force met to formalize components
of the Ring IPC approach, including identification of target
HCFs, a focus on triage, involvement of external staff members
to support triage, and coordination and definition of roles
among partners. The purpose of Ring IPC was to provide
intensive IPC support (3,4) to HCFs in areas of active Ebola

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

What is already known on this topic?
The adoption of essential infection prevention and control (IPC)
practices among health care workers, such as hand washing
and proper use of personal protective equipment, is crucial to
interrupting the transmission of Ebola.
What is added by this report?
From mid-January to mid-February 2015, all confirmed Ebola
cases in Liberia were epidemiologically linked to a single index
patient. Of the 22 confirmed patients in this cluster, eight (36%)
sought and received care from at least one of 10 non-Ebola
health care facilities. During this time, a focused IPC response
effort, termed Ring IPC, was developed collaboratively to target
health care facilities at increased risk for exposure to a person
with Ebola. Rapid, intensive, and short-term IPC support was
provided at these health care facilities following rapid needs
assessments focused on triage procedures and personal
protective equipment use.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The implementation of Ring IPC in Liberia might offer a useful
model for rapid response to Ebola virus transmission and health
care worker exposure in other settings. A comprehensive
strategy remains critical to raising the level of IPC capacity
nationwide; however, an appropriately targeted Ring IPC
approach might be an effective supplemental strategy to focus
IPC support in response to clusters of disease.

transmission, thus forming a strategically placed protective
ring of intensified IPC attention around persons with known
Ebola to help break the chain of transmission. This strategy
entailed selecting target HCFs for Ring IPC intervention based
on known health care worker exposure to an Ebola patient,
neighboring HCFs around the HCF that treated a patient,
or HCFs in close proximity to the residence of a patient with
confirmed Ebola. Next, rapid IPC needs assessments were
conducted at these HCFs using Ministry of Health and Social
Work (MOHSW) approved assessment tools (5). These assessments focused on triage procedures and personal protective
equipment use, and found inadequate or absent triage and
isolation structures, gaps in the personal protective equipment
supply chain, and a need for general IPC training in addition
to specialized triage training.

Training and Equipment
Identified challenges were addressed by the national IPC
Task Force developing training that targeted key personnel.
Triage training, based on existing MOHSW-approved IPC
training materials, was developed and provided to 47 African
Union clinicians. These clinicians were deployed to 36 target
HCFs in Monteserrado County to provide onsite daily triage
mentoring and support for the duration of the high-risk exposure monitoring period, or for at least 2 weeks. Three nurses,

previously employed by an Ebola treatment unit, provided
similar triage support for one hospital. In addition, three
1-day triage training sessions were provided for more than
125 staff members working in three target HCFs. In Margibi
County, a 1-day triage training session was conducted for
11 staff members working in five target HCFs, and African
Union staff and nurses or other county health staff members
provided ongoing triage mentoring and IPC support to seven
target HCFs. This intensive IPC approach served to alert health
care workers to recent Ebola virus transmission in their communities, identify additional contacts at HCFs where Ebola
virus exposure had occurred, and provide a secondary source
(in addition to contact tracing) of information on the health
status of exposed health care workers.
In response to heightened awareness of clinic needs, partners
provided personal protective equipment and other essential IPC
supplies to target facilities. Ring IPC partners in Montserrado
County and the national IPC Task Force initiated an emergency
release of a 1-month supply of personal protective equipment to
priority clinics. Nongovernmental organization partners assessed
and constructed triage structures when needed.

Initiation of Rings
During January 23–February 9, in response to the ongoing
St. Paul Bridge cluster, four IPC rings were initiated in Liberia,
three in Montserrado County and one in Margibi County
(Figure). The first ring was initiated 4 days after recognition
that a facility had provided care to an Ebola patient; subsequent
rings were initiated within 2 days after recognition of other
Ebola patients. In total, 59 target HCFs were identified, 52 in
Montserrado County (out of a total of 294 HCFs) and seven
(out of a total of 32) in Margibi County. There was an average
of 15 HCFs per ring (range = 3–31).
Overall, Ring IPC efforts appeared to be associated with
an increase in the identification and isolation of suspected or
probable Ebola patients. For example, three probable Ebola
patients were identified through triage during training conducted at one target HCF in Montserrado County. Only one
of the 166 exposed health care workers in the St. Paul Bridge
cluster became infected with Ebola. This low prevalence of
secondary infection among health care workers suggests that
basic infection prevention principles were being observed by
health care workers during this period. Nevertheless, triage was
not always completely successful; the one health care worker
who became infected with Ebola after Ring IPC activities were
initiated actually sought care at his place of employment, an
identified target HCF, and was permitted to enter without first
being properly triaged as a probable or suspect Ebola patient.

Discussion

Included among the Ebola response efforts in Liberia was
the creation in early September 2014 of a national IPC Task
Force to support the MOHSW. The IPC Task Force served
as a coordinating body to facilitate IPC planning and implementation of activities in both health care and non–health care
facilities, as well as providing IPC guidance and technical assistance through policy development and standardization of IPC
training and implementation tools consistent with MOHSW
priorities. The national IPC strategy had focused on providing
a comprehensive package of IPC training and support, through
trained IPC specialists, at major health facilities throughout the
country because of widespread Ebola transmission occurring
at the time. This strategy includes promoting essential IPC
practices among health care workers, such as hand washing
and proper use of personal protective equipment. Although a
comprehensive strategy remains critical to raising the level of
IPC capacity nationwide, an appropriately targeted Ring IPC
approach might be an effective supplemental strategy to focus
IPC support in response to clusters of disease.
The public health intervention described in this report was
rapidly implemented and integrated into Liberia’s national
Ebola response as a result of coordinated, collaborative efforts by
multiple partners. Coordination and collaboration among the
national Incident Management System, county health teams,
CDC, WHO, African Union and nongovernmental organization
partners was key to identifying gaps in IPC needs and preventing
duplication of efforts. The initial ring was coordinated by the
IPC Task Force under MOHSW leadership. In subsequent rings,
the national Incident Management System and county health
departments joined efforts with CDC, WHO, African Union,
and multiple nongovernmental organization partners participating in initial discussions, planning, and rapid IPC assessments. In
general, HCFs welcomed additional training, personal protective
equipment provision, and triage mentoring and support. The
placement of IPC staff members trained in triage at target HCFs
following training was readily adopted by clinic staff.
The implementation of Ring IPC in Liberia might offer a useful
model for rapid response to Ebola virus transmission and health
care worker exposure in other settings. This approach, however,
might be most appropriate at the beginning or near the end of an
outbreak, when specific chains of transmission can be identified and
when HCFs can be identified and targeted based on their risk for
encountering an Ebola patient when there is known active transmission in their geographical area. Urban settings present challenges to
this approach, because persons might seek care at HCFs outside of
their immediate community. Although limitations in both supplies
(personal protective equipment and infrared thermometers) and
human resources (appropriately trained personnel) might inhibit a

508

MMWR / May 15, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 18

timely response to initiating IPC activities, the Ring IPC approach
might be used to prioritize these limited resources.
The Ring IPC approach was developed rapidly and collaboratively in response to an urgent public health need; as such,
data were not collected and aggregated systematically across
all facilities, potentially limiting the generalizability of these
results. Nonetheless, as a result of Ring IPC efforts, health
care workers at HCFs in areas with recent active transmission
are now better equipped and trained to rapidly triage, isolate,
and refer suspected and probable Ebola patients to appropriate
Ebola treatment unit facilities. As Liberia looks ahead, a new
culture of IPC can be incorporated into the health system; a
Ring IPC approach might be useful in minimizing the transmission in non-Ebola HCFs should new cases of Ebola occur.

Click It or Ticket Campaign — May 18–31, 2015
Click It or Ticket, a national campaign coordinated annually by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to increase
the proper use of seat belts, takes place May 18–31, 2015.
Using a seat belt is one of the most effective ways to prevent
serious injury or death in the event of a crash. Using lap/shoulder seat belts can reduce the risk of fatal injury by almost 50%
(1). In 2013, more than 21,000 passenger vehicle occupants
died in motor vehicle crashes in the United State; 49% were
unrestrained at the time of the crash (2). An additional 2.4
million nonfatal injuries were treated in emergency departments in 2013 (3). Yet, millions of persons continue to travel
unrestrained (4).
During the 2015 Click it or Ticket campaign,* law enforcement agencies across the nation will conduct intensive, highvisibility enforcement of seat belt laws, during both daytime
and nighttime hours. Nighttime enforcement of seat belt laws
is encouraged because seat belt use is lower at night (2).

awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke and encourages
persons to act F.A.S.T.* (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech
difficulty, Time to call 9–1–1) if someone is having a stroke.
Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and
a leading cause of severe disability (1,2). In the United States,
on average, one person dies from stroke every 4 minutes (2).
Stroke is largely preventable. You may be able to prevent
stroke or reduce your risk through healthy lifestyle changes.
High blood pressure is one of the major risk factors for stroke.
Others include high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, heart disease,
obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.†
National High Blood Pressure Education Month focuses on
saving lives by increasing awareness and educating the public
about cardiovascular disease risks and how to prevent them. High
blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is considered the
“silent killer” because it can damage the heart, brain, and kidneys
without any symptoms (2). In the United States, nearly one in
three adults has hypertension, and only about half have their
condition under control (3). Hypertension is the leading risk

factor for stroke and heart attacks. Each day in the United States,
more than 1,000 deaths are associated with hypertension (2).
To control hypertension and reduce their risk for stroke,
patients can take medications as directed, monitor their blood
pressure, and eat a lower-sodium diet and more fruits and
vegetables. Health care providers can use electronic health
records, blood pressure measurement, and a team-based care
approach to help improve their patients’ hypertension control.
Patients and providers can find more information at http://

CDC focuses on promoting cardiovascular health, improving
quality of care for all, and eliminating disparities associated
with heart disease and stroke. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure and http://www.

* Information on health insurance coverage is collected at the time of interview. Three of the four categories
(any private, including workplace; public only [Medicare, Medicaid, military, and state/local government
plans]; and uninsured) are mutually exclusive, but might not sum to 100% because of rounding.
† Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population
and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey family core.
§ 95% confidence interval.

In 2012–2013, persons aged 55–64 years were less likely to have private health insurance coverage (69.8%) than persons in the
same age group in 2002–2003 (76.7%); persons in the 2012–2013 age group also were less likely to have private coverage through
the workplace (62.0%) than persons in the same age group in 2002–2003 (69.5%). Also, in 2012–2013, a greater percentage
aged 55–64 years had only public health insurance coverage (16.9%) than in 2002–2003 (12.1%) and a greater percentage were
uninsured (13.4%) than in 2002–2003 (11.2%).
