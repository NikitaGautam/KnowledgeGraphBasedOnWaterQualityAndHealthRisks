BACKGROUND: Sanitary sewer overﬂows (SSOs) occur when untreated sewage is discharged into water sources before reaching the treatment facility,
potentially contaminating the water source with gastrointestinal pathogens.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to assess associations between SSO events and rates of gastrointestinal (GI) illness in Massachusetts.
METHODS: A case-crossover study design was used to investigate association between SSO events and emergency room (ER) visits with a primary diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) illness in Massachusetts for 2006–2007. ER visits for GI were considered exposed if an SSO event occurred in the
county of residence within three hazard periods, 0–4 d, 5–9 d, or 10–14 d, before the visit. A time-stratiﬁed bidirectional design was used to select
control days for each ER visit on the same day of the week during the same month. Fixed eﬀect logistic regression models were used to estimate the
risk of ER visits following the SSO event.
RESULTS: During the study period, there were 270 SSO events for northeastern Massachusetts and 66,460 ER admissions with GI illness listed as the
primary diagnostic code. The overall odds ratio (OR) for ER visits for GI illness was 1.09 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.16] in the 10–14 d
period following an SSO event, with positive ORs for all age groups and for three of the four counties. The 0–4 d and 5–9 d periods following an
SSO event were not associated with ER visits for GI illness overall, and associations by county or age were inconsistent.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated an association between SSO events and ER visits for GI illness using a case-crossover study design. In light of the
aging water infrastructure in the United States and the expected increase in heavy rainfall events, our ﬁndings suggest a potential health impact associated with sewage overﬂows. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2048

Introduction
Water infrastructure in the United States is aging, and many,
older cities in the United States have infrastructure that needs to
be upgraded. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
estimates that the majority of the nation’s sewage collection
infrastructure is between 30 and 100 y old, putting it at risk for
leaks, blockages, and malfunctions due to deterioration (U.S.
EPA 2000). This aging water infrastructure is vulnerable to
changes in weather that are expected to occur with climate
change (Patz et al. 2005, 2008). In particular, the expected
changes in precipitation events and increases in heavy rainfall
events can have negative impacts on water infrastructure. Heavy
rainfall events can overwhelm these systems, causing untreated
waters and sewage to be released into receiving waters. Two
studies conducted in Massachusetts reported associations
between ﬂood events and emergency room (ER) visits for gastrointestinal (GI) illness and speciﬁcally for outpatient visits associated with Clostridium diﬃcile infection (Lin et al. 2015; Wade
et al. 2014). Other studies focusing on speciﬁc infrastructure concerns have demonstrated that combined sewer overﬂow (CSO)
events may be associated with increased GI illness. A study in
Massachusetts found that CSO releases into drinking water sources were associated with higher rates of ER visits for GI illness

following heavy rainfall events (Jagai et al. 2015). Another study,
conducted in New Jersey, estimated the probability of acquiring
GI illness from accidental ingestion of water contaminated by
CSO outfalls was 0.70 over the course of a year for people who
recreated in the aﬀected waters (Donovan et al. 2008).
Sanitary sewer systems, which, unlike combined sewer systems, have separate networks for sewage and storm water, are
still vulnerable to excess precipitation. According to the U.S.
EPA, there are approximately 19,500 sewer systems nationwide
designed to handle an average daily ﬂow of roughly 50 billion
gallons of raw sewage (U.S. EPA 2000). Sanitary sewer overﬂows (SSOs) occur when untreated sewage is discharged into the
environment from the sanitary sewer system before reaching sewage treatment facilities; they are more likely to occur as a result
of aging water infrastructure (U.S. EPA 2016a). SSOs can occur
for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, severe
weather, blockages and breaks in the sewer lines, improper system operation and maintenance, and vandalism (U.S. EPA
2016a). These events are a concern because raw sewage containing pathogens is discharged directly into the environment. The
magnitude of SSO events can vary greatly, ranging from small
events aﬀecting just one household, such as basement ﬂooding,
to events aﬀecting several street blocks. The potential for exposure can, therefore, range from a few people having direct contact
with raw sewage (in the smaller events) to directly aﬀecting
drinking water and recreational water sources (in the larger
events). Currently, the U.S. EPA estimates that 23,000–75,000
SSO events, not including those that back up into individual
buildings (i.e., into basements), occur each year (U.S. EPA
2016a). In 1995, the U.S. EPA identiﬁed 1,103 large (i.e., those
producing more than 10 million gallons of wastewater) sanitary
sewer systems with untreated sewage overﬂows that required corrective action by the end of 2016. Regulatory action includes
assessment and, where appropriate, a civil judicial complaint, an
enforceable federal or state enforcement order, or permit requirements met (appropriate permits obtained) that address the noncompliance. At the end of 2015, 914 systems had complied with
required corrective action, and 83 had initiated enforcement
actions (U.S. EPA 2016b).

SSO reporting requirements vary from state to state. Several
states, including California, Texas, and Massachusetts, have
passed laws mandating the reporting of SSOs, whereas events are
underreported in other states (U.S. EPA 2000). Based on a sample of news reports from 2000, there were at least 59 SSO events
in 18 states that resulted in the release of an estimated 1.2 billion
gallons of sewage (U.S. EPA 2000). Of those reported, the most
signiﬁcant was a release into Florida’s Indian River of approximately 72 million gallons of raw sewage that resulted in drinking
water advisories and beach closures throughout most of the state
(U.S. EPA 2000).
These SSO events can contaminate water sources with pathogenic microorganisms associated with untreated sewage, including protozoa (e.g., Cryptosporidium sp.), viruses (e.g., norovirus,
adenovirus), and bacteria (e.g., Salmonella sp.) (Donovan et al.
2008; Gerba 2000; Levin et al. 2002; Marsalek and Rochfort
2004). Infection with these pathogens can cause gastroenteritis
(i.e., diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) and upper respiratory infections. When SSO events contaminate public places and waters,
people can be at risk of exposure to the untreated sewage when
recreating in open waters, drinking from a contaminated water
supply, coming in contact with contaminated ﬂood waters, or eating contaminated ﬁsh or shellﬁsh. In September 2000, residents
of Springﬁeld, Missouri, and neighboring communities were
issued drinking-water alerts after a million-gallon SSO event into
Goodwin Hollow Creek, an underground stream that fed several
springs and that was the source for private water wells (U.S. EPA
2000).
To our knowledge, no studies have quantiﬁed the health risk
associated with SSO events in the United States. The goal of this
study was to estimate associations between SSO events and gastrointestinal illness in Massachusetts. We used data on SSO
events for 2006–2007 from the eastern region of Massachusetts
and emergency room (ER) visits for GI illnesses to estimate
associations. The aims were to determine if there was a positive association between SSO events and ER visits for GI illness and to evaluate potential variation among subpopulations
and geographic areas.

Methods
Emergency Room Visits
ER visits for gastrointestinal illness were collected from the State of
Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy,
Executive Oﬃce of Health and Human Services (http://www.
chiamass.gov/), from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2007, as
described previously (Lin et al. 2015; Wade et al. 2014; Jagai et al.
2015). Patient-level information available in the Massachusetts ER
database included town and residential zip code, age, gender, primary diagnosis code, and ﬁve associated secondary diagnosis codes.
The diagnoses were coded according to the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation
(ICD-9-CM; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013).
Visits to the ER for GI illness were restricted to those with a primary diagnosis of ICD9-CM 001-009, 558.9, 787, 787.0, 787.4,
787.9, or 787.91. This list includes bacterial, viral, and protozoal
pathogens that have incubation periods ranging from <1 d to 14 d.
We excluded a priori ER visits with a diagnosis of Clostridium difﬁcile (008.45) because it is primarily considered a hospital-acquired
infection (Lin et al. 2015; Wade et al. 2014; Bouza 2012). In addition, annual rates of ER visits for GI illness were calculated for all
locations and by county per 1,000 population using county-level
intercensal population estimates for the years 2006 and 2007
(U.S. Census Bureau 2011). Average annual rates for the two years
were also calculated.
Environmental Health Perspectives

The ER data obtained did not contain any personally identifying
information and was collected by the state of Massachusetts for
administrative purposes. Therefore, informed consent was not necessary, and the use of administrative data was determined to be
exempt from Institutional Review Board review (Wade et al. 2014).

Sanitary Sewer Overflows
Information on sanitary sewer overﬂow (SSO) events was
obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-departmentof-environmental-protection). The state of Massachusetts requires
all SSO events to be reported immediately by wastewater facility
operators via telephone, email, or both, and a written report is to
be submitted within 5 d. This database includes information such
as the date and location (town and county) of the SSO event.
The main cause of the SSO (e.g., heavy rainfall, infrastructure
failure) was also documented. Complete SSO event data were
only available for four counties in the northeastern region of
Massachusetts: Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suﬀolk. SSO
events occurring between 1 December 2005 and 31 January
2008 were included in the analysis (Figure 1). Data for previous
years were not available in electronic format and therefore were
not accessible for this analysis.

Statistical Analyses
In this analysis, we used a case-crossover approach to evaluate
the association between SSO events and ER visits due to GI illness stratiﬁed by either county (the four counties with available
SSO data: Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suﬀolk) or by age category. Age categories included <5 y of age, 6–19 y of age,
20–64 y of age, and >65 y of age. A case-crossover design is
useful when an exposure is transient, such as an SSO event. The
study is self-matched, with each case serving as its own control.
In the case-crossover design, cases serve as their own controls at
a diﬀerent time period before or after the disease event.
Occurrence of the exposure during a predeﬁned hazard period
(the time interval before the event when the exposure is
believed to cause the event) is compared by case and control
status (Maclure 1991; Maclure and Mittleman 2000). For our
analysis, cases are dates of ER visits for GI illness, and controls
are dates selected before and/or after the case date. Individual
characteristics, such as gender, race, and comorbid conditions,
do not need to be controlled for in the analysis because the study
design itself accounts for these variants in the population (Wade
et al. 2014; Maclure 1991; Maclure and Mittleman 2000). It was
hypothesized that GI illness could have occurred 0–14 d following an SSO event, representing the lag between sewage discharge and exposure and symptoms (incubation period) (Lin
et al. 2015; Wade et al. 2014; Jagai et al. 2015). We divided

From 1 December 2005 to 31 January 2008, 270 SSO events
were recorded by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection for the northeastern region of Massachusetts. SSO events
were the most frequent in Middlesex (n = 169) and Essex (n = 71)
Counties (Table 1). During the study period, there were 66,460 ER
admissions with GI illness listed as the primary diagnostic code, representing a rate of 9.4 per 1,000 population. Overall, the highest
counts of ER admissions for GI illness were in Middlesex
(n = 23,355) and Suﬀolk (n = 17,125) Counties, representing average annual rates of 8.0 and 12.4 per 1,000 population, respectively.

Because it is hypothesized that severe rain events are expected
to increase in the future (U.S. EPA 2014), thus contributing to
potentially more SSO events, we subset the data and reran the
analyses using only SSO events caused by heavy rainfall. We
also considered a less-restricted deﬁnition of a GI-illness ER
visit. Rather than only considering cases with a primary diagnosis
of GI illness (see above, “Emergency Room Visits”), we
expanded the deﬁnition to include at least the primary diagnosis
or any of the ﬁve associated secondary diagnostic codes available
in the Massachusetts ER database (http://www.chiamass.gov/).
All data were analyzed using Stata v.13 (StataCorp LLC),
and conditional logistic regression was performed using the
xtlogit command. Graphics were created using R version 3.1.2
(R Project for Statistical Computing) using the ggplot2 package
(Wickham 2009).

this time window into three mutually exclusive categories: 0–4
d, 5–9 d, and 10–14 d. We hypothesized that ER visits occurring
shortly after the SSO event (0–4 d) would most likely be due to
direct contact with the raw sewage, whereas ER visits farther
away in time from the SSO event (5–9 d and 10–14 d) would
most likely be associated with indirect exposure resulting from
drinking from a sewage-contaminated supply following the overﬂow
event.
ER visits occurring outside of Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk,
and Suﬀolk Counties in Massachusetts were excluded. In this
analysis, we used a time-stratiﬁed referent selection process
(Wade et al. 2014), which is subject to very little bias due to
seasonal variation or other time trends (Janes et al. 2005). To
choose controls, the entire study period (1 December 2005–
31 January 2008) was divided into 26 total months. Control
dates were selected two weeks before and/or two weeks after
the case ER admission date. Depending on when the admission
date occurred, each case date had one or two control dates
within the same month. In addition, control dates were matched
by day of the week to account for any variability in care-seeking
behavior based on the day of the week. Exposure to an SSO
event was determined if the case ER admission date or if the
control date(s) was within 0–4 d, 5–9 d, or 10–14 d following
an SSO event. SSO events from the last month in 2005
(December) and the ﬁrst month in 2008 (January) were included
in the analysis to assign exposure associated with case and/or
control hazard periods corresponding to ER visits in early 2006
and late 2007. In addition, we addressed seasonal factors such
as temperature and seasonal variations in gastrointestinal illness
by matching cases and controls within a narrow time frame
(1 mo).
The data were analyzed using a ﬁxed eﬀect conditional
logistic model (Lin et al. 2015; Wade et al. 2014). Separate conditional models for each county and by age category were run,
and the results were qualitatively assessed for marked diﬀerences by county and by age group.



The highest average annual rates were seen in the youngest age category of 0–5 y, with 74.3 and 55.2 per 1,000 population in Suﬀolk
and Essex Counties, respectively.
The combined odds ratios (ORs) for ER visits for GI illness
were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.03) and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.07) in
the 0–4 and 5–9 d periods following an SSO event, respectively
(Figure 2). However, in the 10–14 d following an SSO event,
there was evidence of increased ER visits for GI illness, with a
combined OR = 1:09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.16). Considering countystratiﬁed results, the 0–4 d hazard period following an SSO event
showed consistently negative, though insigniﬁcant, odds ratios,
whereas the results were highly variable for the 5–9 d period following an SSO event. The odd ratios for the 10–14 d hazard period after an SSO event were generally increased, with the
strongest associations observed in Suﬀolk County (Figure 2). The
results also varied by age category (Figure 3). The 0–4 d hazard
period following an SSO event showed consistently negative,
though insigniﬁcant, odds ratios for all age groups. The 5–9 d
hazard period showed inverse associations for the younger age
categories and increased odd ratios for the 20–64 y and >65 y
age categories. The strongest associations were again observed in
the 10–14 d hazard period following an SSO event for all age
groups, and the strongest association was observed in those
between 6 and 19 y of age, although the association was imprecise and had a large conﬁdence interval (Figure 3).
For sensitivity analyses, we considered ER visits for which
GI illness was the primary diagnosis or for which any of 5 associated secondary diagnosis codes included GI illness (see Table
S1). The number of admissions increased to 104,322; however,
the patterns of association were similar. The combined odds
ratios for ER visits for GI illness were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.01)
and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.07) in the 0–4 and 5–9 d periods following an SSO event, respectively (see Figure S1). The strongest

associations were seen in the 10–14 d hazard period when considering all counties [OR = 1:05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.11)] and again
in Suﬀolk County [OR = 1:15 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.24)] speciﬁcally
(see Figure S1). Similar to the primary diagnosis–only analysis,
the associations were slightly elevated in those 6–19 y old
[OR = 1:15 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.34)] (see Figure S2). In the analysis
of SSOs driven by heavy rainfall only, which included a total of
131 events, the 0–4 and 5–9 d periods following an SSO event
showed inverse associations: OR = 0:92 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99) and
OR = 0:86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93), respectively (results not shown).
However, there was a positive association in the 10–14 d hazard
period following an SSO event for all counties [OR = 1:04 (95%
CI: 0.96, 1.12)], but the association was attenuated compared
with all SSO events (results not shown).

Discussion
In the four eastern Massachusetts counties included in our analysis, an ER visit for GI illness was more likely 10–14 d after a sanitary sewer overﬂow event than 10–14 d after a day without an
SSO event. In contrast, ER visits for GI illness did not appear to
be associated with SSO events 0–4 d or 5–9 d before the ER visit.
Our ﬁndings suggest that SSO events may be associated with ER
visits for GI illness. SSO events could introduce pathogenic
microorganisms that cause gastrointestinal illness into the environment, where people may come into contact with them through
drinking water, recreational water, contaminated soil, or other
transmission routes. Previous studies have suggested that overﬂow events can contaminate water sources because they contain
fecal matter and pathogens, which can contaminate water supplies, soil, and other environments with pathogens that cause gastrointestinal illness (Donovan et al. 2008; Gerba 2000; Levin
et al. 2002; Marsalek and Rochfort 2004). However, our study is

the ﬁrst that we know of to demonstrate an association between
SSO events and GI illness.
Although the impact of SSO events on health outcomes has
not been previously studied, there have been a few studies that
have considered the impact of combined sewer overﬂows (CSOs)
on enteric infections in humans. A study in Massachusetts found
that areas with CSOs discharging to drinking-water sources had
higher rates of ER visits for GI illness following heavy rainfall
events (Jagai et al. 2015). Using a human health risk assessment
methodology, another study estimated that the probability of
acquiring GI illness from incidental ingestion of water contaminated by CSO outfalls was 70% over the course of a year for
those who recreated in the contaminated waters (Donovan
et al. 2008). Two Wisconsin studies of pediatric ER visits for
diarrheal illness reported an increase following sewage bypass
events for those whose drinking-water supply was sourced
from Lake Michigan (Drayna et al. 2010; Redman et al. 2007).
Although SSO events are generally smaller than CSO events in
terms of volume discharged, they are nevertheless a signiﬁcant
concern because they are not regulated in the same way as
CSO events. Combined sewer overﬂow systems are permitted
through the U.S. EPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) because overﬂows are expected, and all overﬂow events are to be reported through this system. However,
laws for reporting SSO events vary from state to state,
and many states do not have any reporting requirements. In
Massachusetts, the reporting of SSO events is required; therefore, we believe the database to be complete. Although the data
on the volume of the overﬂow may be estimated, the date and
location of the SSO event, which were used in our analysis, are
accurate.
One advantage of our study is the use of the case-crossover
design, which controls for nonvarying individual factors (i.e., sex
and race). This study design also controls for factors that are
Environmental Health Perspectives

not likely to vary over the 28 d between the case and referent
periods (i.e., age, comorbid conditions, and other factors). In
addition, this study design is advantageous because time trends
and day-to-day variations in behavior (e.g., people are less
likely to go to the ER on weekends) are also controlled for
through time stratiﬁcation and matching by day of the week.
Because we did not have access to personally identifying information, we could not rule out the possibility that some individuals may have visited the ER for GI illness on multiple
occasions. Although we expect multiple visits by the same individual to be rare, this is a limitation that could aﬀect our estimates in a direction that is diﬃcult to predict.
Although the association estimated in our study (OR = 1:09
at 10–14 d) is small in magnitude, it suggests a potential preventable large public health impact at the population level. The
use of ER data is a limitation of this study because it is inﬂuenced by factors such as access to emergency care facilities
and the severity of the illness. Moreover, the majority of GI illnesses do not result in ER visits (Craun et al. 2010; Schuster
et al. 2005; Yoder et al. 2008), and those that do result in ER
visits may not be representative of the broader occurrence of
GI illness in the population.
The association between increased ER visits and SSO events
was only observed in the 10–14 d period following the SSO
event. This may be due to delayed exposure to pathogens in the
environment (e.g., in contaminated ﬂood waters), illness caused
by pathogens with longer incubation periods (such as protozoa),
a delay in the time from the onset of illness to an ER visit, or a
combination of these factors. Previous studies of drinking water
turbidity and GI illness have concluded that lag structures with a
mean of 7–8 d were the most appropriate for the estimation of
lagged eﬀects (Egorov et al. 2003; Naumova and Macneill 2008).
In the 10–14 d period following an SSO event, associations
were elevated for each age group, and although estimates were

117007-5



slightly stronger in the 6–19 y age group, the 95% conﬁdence
bounds overlapped considerably with the estimates for the
other age groups.
We observed variations in associations between SSO events
and ER visits for GI illness across the counties considered, with
the strongest associations occurring in Suﬀolk County. The counties we considered in our analysis diﬀered in several ways that
could aﬀect the association between SSO events and ER visits
for GI illness, including service provider, age and maintenance of
infrastructure, size of population, and size of county. Diﬀerences
in risk factors for GI infections among counties, such as
drinking-water source (ground, surface, or mixed) and septic tank
density, may contribute to diﬀerences in associations between
SSO events and ER visits among counties (Cohen et al. 2008;
Naumova et al. 2000). Diﬀerences in these factors among counties may explain the variation in the associations between SSO
events and ER visits for GI illness we demonstrate by county.
Future work on the health impact of SSO events should include
outpatient visits for GI illness and should also consider variations
in the communities, the severity of the SSO event, and the potential pathway of exposure.
With climate change, it is predicted that extreme rainfall
events will increase, thereby increasing the possibility of SSO
events. It is estimated that single-day heavy rainfall events are
expected to increase, particularity in the northeastern United
States (U.S. EPA 2014; Spierre and Wake 2010). The increase in
intensity of precipitation events will likely cause more SSO
events because the infrastructure is not designed to handle large
volumes of water. Our study provides evidence that SSO events
may be associated with increased risk of ER visits for gastrointestinal illness. Our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst that we know of to demonstrate this association and require conﬁrmation; however,
they support the need for additional research to evaluate potential health impacts of SSOs and to determine appropriate public
health responses.

Conclusion
We observed an association between SSO events and emergency
room visits for GI illness. The overall OR for ER visits for GI illness was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.16) in the 10–14 d period following an SSO event. In light of the aging water infrastructure in the
United States and the expected increase in heavy rainfall events,
our ﬁndings suggest a potential health impact associated with
sewage overﬂows and a need for increased study of the health
impacts of sewer overﬂow events.
