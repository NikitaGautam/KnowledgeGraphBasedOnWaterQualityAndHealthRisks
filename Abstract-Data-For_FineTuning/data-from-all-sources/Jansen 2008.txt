Abstract
Background: The aetiology of severe gastroenteritis leading to hospitalisation in adults frequently remains
unclear. Our objective was to study the causes and characteristics of community-acquired, acute gastroenteritis
in adult hospitalized patients to support the clinical management of these patients.
Methods: From August 2005 to August 2007, we conducted a prospective cohort study among patients t18 y
hospitalized with community-acquired gastroenteritis in a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Stool specimens
were examined for 26 gastrointestinal pathogens, supplemented by serologic tests for antibodies to Campylobacter
spp., Yersinia spp., and Entamoeba histolytica. Patient data on demographics and clinical presentation were recorded
and analyzed. Coexisting medical conditions were assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index score.
Results: Of 132 patients presenting with acute community-acquired gastroenteritis, 104 were included in the
study. A non-infectious aetiology was diagnosed in 8 patients (8%). In 79 (82%) of the remaining 96 patients at
least one microorganism was identified. Campylobacter spp. (35%) was detected most frequently, followed by
norovirus (23%), Salmonella spp. (20%), and rotavirus (15%). In 46% of the patients with Campylobacter spp.
infection, the diagnosis was made solely by serology. More than one pathogen was found in seventeen (22%)
patients. Simultaneous infection was significantly more likely in patients with rotavirus and salmonella infections
(RR 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8–7.4; RR 2.5; 95%CI: 1.2–5.5). Length of hospital stay (median: 5.5 days) was independent of
the pathogen, but was associated with coexisting medical conditions (OR 4,8; 95%CI:2,0–11,6).
Conclusion: Known enteric pathogens were detected in 82% of adult patients who were hospitalized with acute
gastroenteritis. We found that currently used culture-based methods may miss a substantial proportion of
Campylobacter infections, and additional serological testing for Campylobacter should be considered. Viral
infections emerged as an important cause of severe gastroenteritis in adults, and viral-bacterial co-infections in
adults are probably underrecognized so far. The presence of coexisting medical conditions – but not the
etiological agent – was a predictor for the duration of the hospital stay.

Background
Infectious gastroenteritis is a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality worldwide [1]. In developed countries,
peak incidences of infectious gastroenteritis are found in
younger age groups (< 5 years), while severe disease leading to hospitalisation and resulting in death is most frequently observed in elderly patients (> 60 years) [2].
Several studies have focused on the aetiology of infectious
diarrhea in hospitalized children. The epidemiology of
hospitalisations associated with gastroenteritis in adults,
however, has not been well investigated so far, even
though it imposes a major burden on the patient and the
health care system [3]. In a few, mostly retrospective studies a causative pathogen was diagnosed in only 39–58%
of all patients, leaving a considerable diagnostic gap [4-7].
The objective of the present study was to investigate the
aetiology and characteristics of community-acquired,
acute gastroenteritis leading to hospitalisation in adults in
a developed country. Our intention was also to provide
data for recommendations concerning routine testing
panels in this patient group to guide clinicians in the
rational use of diagnostic methods for enteric pathogens.
In addition, since hospitalisation for gastroenteritis is generally considered to be a preventable outcome, we determined possible risk groups for severe disease to put
forward targeted preventive measures.

Methods
Study design
From August 2005 to August 2007, we conducted a prospective cohort study among patients t18 years of age presenting with acute gastroenteritis as the primary diagnosis
at the emergency department of the Charité – Benjamin
Franklin University Hospital and who were subsequently
referred to the infectious disease ward. Reasons for hospitalisation included severe dehydration, and other conditions requiring stationary treatment (e.g. severe
hypocalemia, new-onset atrial fibrillation, anaemia). The
hospital with 1030 hospital beds, and 19 medical departments is located in the south-west of Berlin, and serves a
demographically varied urban and suburban population.
Patients were considered to have acute gastroenteritis if
they had t 3 loose stools per day or vomited, and their
onset of symptoms was within 48 h before presentation.
Patients were excluded from the study if a history of
inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) or of other diseases associated with diarrhea
(e.g., celiac disease, collagenous or microscopic colitis,
misuse of laxatives, Whipple's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis) was known. Information
on demographics (age, sex, place of residence), clinical
presentation (onset of symptoms, stool frequency), and
the medical history for each patient was captured on a
standard structured questionnaire. Coexisting medical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/143

conditions were assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity
Index score, including 19 major disease categories [8,9].
The study was approved by the ethical committee of the
Charité, and all study participants had given their written,
informed consent.
Stool specimens and serum samples
At least three separate stool specimens for bacterial culture
and one stool specimen for viral reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were provided by all
patients and subjected to microbiological analysis. The
first stool specimens for each patient were collected
within 24 hours after admission.

Patients for whom stool cultures did not yield positive
results were asked to provide paired serum samples to
determine antibodies to Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp.,
and Entamoeba (E.) histolytica. The first serum sample was
collected within the first five days and a second one
between the third and sixth week after the onset of the disease.
Detection of bacteria
For the growth of Clostridium (C.) difficile, stool specimens
were pre-treated with alcohol shock (absolute alcohol for
30 min) before culture. Otherwise, fresh stool specimens
were used. Standard solid media, i.e., MacConkey, xylose
lysine deoxycholate, bismuth sulfite (Wilson-Blair), and
Salmonella-Shigella agars, as well as selenite and
tetrathionate (Preuss) broths (all Oxoid, Wesel, Germany)
were used to detect Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and Vibrio species. In addition, cefsulodin irgasan
novobiocin agar, Skirrow agar supplemented with 10%
sheep blood, PALCAM listeria agar, and cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (all Oxoid) were inoculated for the
detection of Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and C. difficile, respectively. To detect Arcobacter
butzleri, Skirrow agar plates were inoculated and cultured
at 37°C. Suspicious bacterial colonies were further isolated and differentiated using routine techniques (e.g.,
oxidase, hippurate, and motility for Campylobacter spp.
and A. butzleri, agglutination for Salmonella spp., Shigella
spp., and Vibrio spp.) and the API system (BioMerieux,
Nürtingen, Germany). For the detection enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) pre-enriched cultures of
stool specimens were tested with a Shiga toxin EIA.

To detect mycobacteria, stool specimens were decontaminated with NaOH and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and cultured
on Stonebrink and Loewenstein-Jensen agar (BAG, Lich,
Germany) and in a liquid broth culture system (Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Positive samples were
then confirmed by use of PCR techniques. Growth of
mycobacteria was confirmed by acid-fast staining and the

isolates were differentiated by commercially available
nucleic acid probe- and amplification-based systems.
C. difficile toxin was detected in stool samples using a
commercially available ELISA assay (Microtest, Mainz,
Germany).
Serology
Antibodies to Campylobacter spp. were detected by performing complement fixation tests (CFT) (Virion/Serion,
Würzburg, Germany), and positive results were defined by
a t 3-fold increase in antibody titres between paired
serum samples. Antibodies to Yersinia spp. were detected
by agglutination tests (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur,
Marnes-La-Coquette, France). The specificity was confirmed by western blot (Genzyme Virotech, Rüsselsheim,
Germany). To detect antibodies to E. histolytica antigens,
indirect fluorescence antibody (BioMerieux, Nürtingen,
Germany) and indirect haemagglutination tests (Dade
Behring, Marburg, Germany) were performed.
Detection of viruses
Six viruses (i.e., norovirus, rotavirus, aichivirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, and enteroviruses) were detected by RTPCR techniques as previously described [10].
Microscopic detection of parasites
Fresh stool specimens were enriched by the SAF fixationconcentration technique. Wet mounts were prepared from
the sediments and analyzed for trophozoites, cysts, or
oocysts, respectively, of Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Isospora belli, E. histolytica/dispar, Balantidium coli,
and Blastocystis hominis, as well as for helminth eggs. Additionally, a direct immune fluorescence antibody test
(Genzyme Virotech) was performed to detect cysts of G.
lamblia and oocysts of cryptosporidia. Moreover, air-dried
slides were stained according to standard protocols by
using the Kinyoun method (BioMerieux, France) for the
detection of acid-fast coccidia (cryptosporidia, C. cayetanensis, I. belli) and following the Uvitex method for the
detection of microsporidia, respectively.
Statistical analysis
For single proportions, 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) were calculated according to Wilson. One-way
ANOVA, Student's t-test, and the Mann-Whitney test were
used for comparative analysis of continuous variables.
The Pearson's F2 test or Fisher's exact test were used to
assess the significance of differences in proportions
between groups. For cross-tabulations, continuous variables (e.g., length of hospital stay) were dichotomized
using the mean as cut-off. Logistic regression analysis was
used to identify risk factors for length of hospital stay. Variables were manually offered to the model based on their
p-value in log-likelihood tests. Final models were checked

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/143

for interaction terms and colinearity. Relative risks (RR),
Mantel-Haenzel odds ratios (ORMH), and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated using SPSS 14 software, Chicago, USA. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Study cohort
Of all 132 patients hospitalized with acute diarrhea during the study period, 104 (79%) gave their consent and
were included in the study. Twenty-eight patients refused
to participate or were mentally unable to sign the consent
form. The median age of study patients was 48 (18–91)
years, and 47 (45%) were males. Patients were admitted
throughout the year with peak admissions for patients
infected by bacterial pathogens in summer and those harbouring viral pathogens in fall. Five (5%) of the 104 study
patients were admitted to the hospital from nursing
homes, while all other patients were admitted from home.

Coexisting medical conditions were reported for 33
patients: Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 1 in 18,
2 in 2, 3 in 6, 4 in 2 and t 5 in 6 cases. Three patients
received antibiotic treatment (one patient with Salmonella
enterica serovar (S.) Paratyphi, and two patients with
blood cultures positive for S. Enteritidis). No fatalities
were observed in patients of this study during their hospital stay.
Median length of hospital stay was 5.5 (1–34) days. In
univariate analysis, length of stay was independent from
the pathogen group and the patient's sex, but was significantly related to age and medical pre-conditions of
patients. In multivariate analysis, the presence of any
medical pre-condition remained the only significant predictor of a prolonged length of stay (OR 4,8; 95%CI 2,0–
11,6) (table 1). As a continuous variable, Charlson
Comorbidity score was also significantly related to a prolonged length of stay (OR 2,1 per index point; 95%CI
1,3–3,2).
Non-infectious disease aetiology
In 8 (8%) patients, non-infectious aetiology of gastroenteritis was found: non-clostridium antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (n = 4), alcohol-induced diarrhea (n = 2), one
patient with diarrhea induced by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and toxin-induced diarrhea in one
case. Patients with non-infectious aetiology were excluded
from further analysis.
Microbiological findings
In 79 (82%) of the remaining 96 patients whose stool
samples were further investigated, at least one pathogen
was found (figure 1). From the 26 pathogens tested 13
were detected (table 2). Among the patients with positive
test results (n = 79), Campylobacter spp. was the pathogen

was performed.

Norovirus and rotavirus were detected by RT-PCR in 18
(23%) and 12 (15%) patients, respectively. Enterovirus
was detected in six (8%) patients four of whom were coinfected by bacteria. Adenovirus was found in a single
(1%) patient with a concomitant Campylobacter spp. infection.
B. hominis was found as a co-pathogen in two (3%)
patients (S. Enteritidis and Campylobacter spp.). In three
(4%) patients, tests for C. difficile toxins were positive; in
two of these cases, a co-infection was detected (norovirus
and Salmonella Typhimurium). A positive test result for C.
difficile was significantly associated with the use of antimicrobials in the three months prior to hospital admission
(RR 17; 95%CI 1.7–173; p = 0.03). All cases of yersiniosis
(n = 6, 7%) were exclusively diagnosed by serology. In two
patients, atypical mycobacteria (M. avium-intracellulare)
were cultured; one patient was co-infected with S. Enteritidis and rotavirus, the other one with norovirus. The distribution of pathogens divided in etiological groups is
shown in table 3. Higher age (by year) and lower frequency of stools were significantly associated with the
detection of viral pathogens (p = 0.03).
Patients admitted from nursing homes did not differ significantly from other patients with respect to clinical presentation, detected pathogens, and demographic variables.

Mixed infections
In 17 of 79 cases (22%; 95% CI: 13–32%) more than one
pathogen was found (two pathogens in 14 patients, three
pathogens in three patients). Bacteria-viruses co-infections were detected in 13 (76%) of these patients, bacteria-parasites in two patients, bacteria-bacteria and virusesviruses in single patients. Simultaneous infection was significantly more likely in patients with rotavirus infections
(RR 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8–7.4; p = 0.004), enterovirus infections (RR 3.5; 95% CI: 1.7–7.4; p = 0.001), and salmonella infections (RR 2.5; 95%CI: 1.2–5.5; p = 0.02). The
presence of co-infections caused by these pathogens was
independent from age, sex, or presence of medical preconditions. Among patients diagnosed with rotavirus or
Salmonella spp. infections, those with co-infections
reported a significantly higher mean frequency of stools
when compared to patients with single infections of the
respective pathogen (12 vs. 4, p = 0.04; 12 vs. 6; p < 0.05).

Discussion
Our study provides novel insights into the etiologies and
characteristics of acute, community-acquired infectious
gastroenteritis in adults presenting to an university hospital in an industrialized country. After excluding of noninfectious disease etiologies, a causative pathogen was
identified in 82% of the patients. These results demonstrate that comprehensive microbiological analysis substantially reduces the diagnostic gap described in previous
studies [4-7].
Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. were the most common bacterial pathogens found in our cohort. This is con-

sistent with earlier reports using a comparable study
design [4,6,11,12]. In contrast to our results, however, the
ratio of these two bacterial pathogens has previously been
reported to be more or less balanced. The high proportion
of Campylobacter spp. infections found in our study is most
likely explained by the addition of serology for Campylobacter (i.e. seroconversion in CFT) as a diagnostic tool
[13]. Although we used state-of-the-art culture methods,
46% of all patients with Campylobacter spp. infection were
solely detected by serology (i.e., seroconversion). Similar
findings have been reported from outbreaks with Campylobacter spp., and the additional use of serology in investigations of outbreaks has been proposed [14,15]. Our
results suggest that currently employed culture-based
methods have a limited sensitivity also in hospital settings, and may significantly underestimate the incidence
of Campylobacter spp. infection (and possibly prevent
timely antibiotic treatment).
Viral pathogens were detected in approximately one-third
of patients, with norovirus being the most common agent.
This is a considerably higher proportion compared to
those of previous studies conducted in other industrialized countries, where rotavirus and norovirus were found
in less than 5% of patients [3,4,16], and may be explained

by an increasing incidence of these emerging viral infections, the more frequent employment of sensitive detection methods (RT-PCR) in routine diagnostic of these
pathogens in recent years, or both [17]. The increasing relevance of viral pathogens – in particular rotavirus – as a
cause for severe gastroenteritis not only in children, but
also in adults is of importance for both diagnostics and
prevention of the disease in hospitalized adults, especially
with respect to possible rotavirus vaccination campaigns.
In 22% of our patients more than one pathogen was
detected. Although several studies emphasized the importance of concomitant infections in infantile gastrointestinal disease, prospective data on the relevance of coinfections in adults hospitalized with gastroenteritis are
sparse, and dual infections have not been systematically
investigated in this population so far. In addition, the
interpretation of data on mixed viral-bacterial infections,
is complicated by the fact that in many mixed infections
one of the potential enteropathogens (e.g., M. avium-intracellulare) may not etiologically contribute to the gastroenteritis. However, in our study patients with mixed
rotavirus or salmonella infections had a more severe
course of disease (as indicated by a significantly higher
frequency of stools than in patients with single pathogens), thus suggesting that mixed infections indeed contribute to the clinical presentation of gastrointestinal
disease in adults.
Due to the limited sample size we were not able to look
for other indicators of severe gastroenteritis in patients
with mixed infections (e.g., admission to an intensive care
unit, or death) that warrant further examination. Our
findings, however, are of diagnostic and clinical relevance
especially in patients with a severe course of viral gastroenteritis, since a second – potentially treatable – agent
may enhance disease severity. In these cases, a positive
result does not exclude other pathogens, and further diagnosis should be encouraged.
Unless there are epidemiological or clinical evidence for a
specific pathogen, however, our results suggest that testing
for community-acquired enteric pathogens in hospitalized adults in developed countries should initially include
Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Norovirus, and Rotavirus. The costs for this smaller pathogen panel were about
180 in our study.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/143

Almost one-third of patients in this study had coexisting
medical conditions. This adds to the notion that patients
with co-morbidities are at increased risk of developing a
severe course of gastroenteritis that leads to hospitalisation [18]. Surprisingly, the duration of hospital stay was
unrelated to the age of the patient or the aetiology of the
infection, but was significantly longer in patients with a
medical history. Future research and strategies to prevent
severe gastroenteritis in adults for all groups of pathogens
should primarily focus on patients with known co-morbidity.
Although our study provides one of the most thorough
analyses of gastroenteritis in hospitalized adults thus far,
it does have limitations. First, our study population may
be different from other adult populations with gastroenteritis, e.g., because of regional variations in the incidence
and prevalence of gastrointestinal pathogens. Our main
findings, however, are unlikely to be affected by regional
differences, since the sensitivity of stool cultures for
Campylobacter and the increase of viral gastrointestinal
infections that have been observed Europe-wide are not
primarily related to geographic variations.
Second, we did not obtain paired serum samples for
campylobacter serology from all patients, especially from
patients with positive stool culture; future investigations
should compare stool culture, serology, and other diagnostic methods (i.e. antigen tests, PCR) to allow the calculation of test-specific sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a pathogen was detected in more than fourfifths of adult patients hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in this study. Culture-based methods for the diagnosis of Campylobacter spp. seem to miss a substantial
proportion of infections, and should be flanked by serology, or replaced by other diagnostic tests. Clinicians
should be aware of viral pathogens and mixed infections
(i.e., viral-bacterial) as a cause of severe gastroenteritis in
adults. Finally, in our study the duration of hospital stay
was related to the presence of medical pre-conditions, but
not to the etiological agent. This finding might help to
develop clinical algorithms that support decision-making
for in-patient vs. outpatient management.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Though included in the laboratory protocols, we did not
detect the "emerging" pathogens aichivirus or Arcobacter
butzleri in any of the patients, suggesting that these pathogens were not important in our study population at the
time of the investigation.
