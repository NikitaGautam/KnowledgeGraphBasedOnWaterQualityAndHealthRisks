Conclusions: We found increased risk of GI at this urban runoff beach. When FIB source
flowed freely (berm-open), several traditional and rapid indicators were related to illness.
When FIB source was weak (berm-closed) fewer illness associations were seen. These
different relationships under different conditions at a single beach demonstrate the difficulties using these indicators to predict health risk.

Introduction

Current methods for monitoring beach water quality involve
the enumeration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) using culturebased methods, such as membrane filtration or defined
substrate kits. These methods are widely accepted because of
relative ease of use, low cost, and demonstrated relationship
to health risk (Wade et al., 2003; Zmirou et al., 2003). However,
the time required for FIB enumeration ranges from 18 to 24 h,
with confirmation steps adding 1þ days. Each beach is unique,
but FIB concentrations can change substantially on time
scales of less than a day (Boehm et al., 2002). Thus, contaminated beaches remain open during the enumeration period
and the contamination event may have passed by the time
warnings are posted (Leecaster and Weisberg, 2001).
Technological advances provide opportunities to measure
bacterial water quality more rapidly (Bushon et al., 2009;
Haugland et al., 2005; Noble et al., 2010; Noble and Weisberg,
2005). Whereas current EPA-approved methods rely on bacterial growth and metabolic activity, these new rapid molecular
methods directly quantify intracellular molecules, such as
ATP, DNA, or RNA. Eliminating the enrichment and incubation
steps associated with culture-based methods reduces assay
time to as little as two hours and provides the opportunity for
public health warnings to be issued on the same day that
samples are collected (Griffith and Weisberg, 2011). The best
developed of these methods is quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR), such as the Enterococcus spp. (herein referred
to as Enterococcus) assay developed by Haugland et al. (2005).
Quantitative PCR has been found to correlate with traditional
culture-based methods (Griffith et al., 2009; Haugland et al., 2005;
Lavender and Kinzelman, 2009; Noble et al., 2010), even though
the measurement endpoint is different. Given the inherent
differences between the two classes of methods, epidemiology
studies are needed to establish health-risk relationships before
establishing qPCR-based standards. Several studies have
developed this relationship for waters affected by wastewater
effluent (Wade et al., 2006, 2008, 2010), but few have assessed it
for beaches affected by urban runoff (Sinigalliano et al., 2010).
Here we report results from an epidemiologic study comparing
health-risk relationships between qPCR-based (three different
assays) and culture-based quantification of Enterococcus at
a marine recreational beach affected by urban runoff.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Study site

The study was conducted at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point,
California, USA. Based on the frequency and magnitude of FIB

water quality standards exceedances, Doheny Beach is chronically listed as one of the most polluted beaches in California
(www.healthebay.org). Several potential sources of beach FIB
exist including an adjacent small craft harbor and a 21 MGD
secondary treated wastewater outfall 2.1 km offshore, but
modeling and current measurement studies suggest that these
sources are too distant to have a consistent effect on water
quality at this beach (Jones, 2009). The largest and most direct
FIB source to Doheny State Beach is San Juan Creek, which
drains the adjacent 347 km2 watershed. However, southern
California has a Mediterranean climate and San Juan Creek
does not flow to the ocean year-round because a sand berm
forms and effectively dams the creek when creek flow is low.
When the berm is open, the untreated creek-flow discharges
directly to the surf zone and dramatically increases FIB
concentration; when closed, water quality generally improves.
There was no measurable rain during this 12-week study, as is
typical in the summer, and the berm was open for three weeks.

2.2.

Study design

The study was designed as a prospective cohort, similar to
prior studies (Coford et al., 2007; Wade et al., 2006, 2008, 2010).
Participants were recruited each sampling day with current
health and degree of water exposure recorded. Ten to 14 days
later interviewers contacted participants by phone and
recorded illness occurring after their visit. We used regression
models to evaluate the association of illness between swimmers and non-swimmers and between FIB and illness.

2.3.

Water quality data collection and analysis

Surface water samples were collected in sterilized containers at
0.5 m depth on incoming waves. We collected samples three
times (8 AM, 12 Noon, 3 PM) at each of five beach sites, three of
which were within 400 m of the creek mouth (sites A, B, and D),
one that was in the creek (site C), and one that was a reference
site located about 3000 m to the south (site E; see Supplemental
Material, Figure 1). Samples were analyzed for traditional
culture-based FIB (Enterococcus, fecal coliforms, total coliforms)
and three qPCR assays for Enterococcus. Total and fecal coliform
bacteria were enumerated by membrane filtration on m-Endo
and m-FC media, respectively (APHA, 2009). Culture methods
for Enterococcus included EPA Method 1600 (USEPA, 2006) and
EnterolertTM (IDEXX, Westbrook ME; APHA, 2009) a defined
substrate technology. All culture methods were processed
immediately, while filters for the three qPCR methods were
frozen for later processing. Two of the qPCR methods, here
referred to as TaqMan and Scorpion-1 targeted the same broad
species range of the genus Enterococcus, but differed in their
probe chemistries and the manner in which final quantitative

w a t e r r e s e a r c h 4 6 ( 2 0 1 2 ) 2 1 7 6 e2 1 8 6

results were calculated (Haugland et al., 2005; Noble et al., 2010).
The third method, here referred to as Scorpion-2, was identical
to Scorpion-1 except that the primer-probe complex was
slightly modified for more specific amplification of Enterococcus
faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, two of the more common
Enterococcus spp. commonly found in human fecal contamination (Layton et al., 2010). Taqman qPCR results were reported as
calibrator cell equivalents per 100 ml based on the delta-deltaCt
method described in Haugland et al. (2005), whereas Scorpion-1
and Scorpion-2 results were reported in cell equivalents (CE) per
100 ml using the deltaCt method outlined in Pfaffl (2001) and
used by Noble et al. (2010).

2.4.

Beach recruitment and follow-up interviews

The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the
University of California, Berkeley approved all protocols.
Eligibility criteria included: 1) no previous participation in the
study; 2) at least one household member at the beach 18 years
old; 3) home address in United States, Canada, or Mexico; and
4) verbal consent. Interviewers recorded the closest watersampling site to the recruit. Participants were given an incentive (beach ball) and a questionnaire to complete prior to
departure. The questionnaire assessed possible confounding
exposures at the beach and exposures/illnesses experienced
the previous three days. Participants failing to complete the
beach survey on-site were contacted within 3 days by telephone. Ten to 14 days following their visit, participants were
telephoned for a 10e15 min interview. This interview collected
demographic information, swimming and exposures since the
beach day, pre-existing health problems (e.g., chronic diarrhea), and acute health conditions since the beach visit. The
head of household answered questions on behalf of the family.

2.5.

Health outcomes

Health outcomes included gastrointestinal, respiratory,
dermatologic symptoms, and non-specific symptoms. Gastrointestinal outcomes included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
stomachache or abdominal cramping. Diarrhea was defined as
3 loose or watery stools in 24 h (Baqui et al., 1991). Highly
credible gastrointestinal illness (HCGI) was defined as: i) diarrhea; or ii) vomiting; or iii) nausea and stomach cramps; or iv)
nausea and missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal
illness, or (v) stomach cramps and missed daily activities due to
gastrointestinal illness (identical to “GI illness” defined in Wade
et al., 2010). Respiratory outcomes included cough and sore
throat symptoms. Highly credible respiratory illness was
defined as any 2 of the following symptoms: cough, runny nose,
sore throat, fever or cold. Dermatologic outcomes included skin
rashes and infected cuts. Non-specific symptoms included
fever, ear infection, allergies, watery eyes, eye infection, and
urinary tract infection. Respondents who reported a symptom
at baseline (within 72 h before the beach visit) were excluded
from analysis for that outcome, but not other outcomes.

2.6.

Definition of swimming

We used four graded definitions of “swimmer” based on an
individual’s reported minimum exposure: i) any water contact;

ii) body immersion; iii) head immersion; and iv) swallowed
water. We defined body immersion as water contact above the
waist, head immersion as head below the water line, and
swallowed water as ingestion of any ocean water.

2.7.

Statistical methods and data analysis

For swim exposure analyses, we modeled the probability of
illness, p, with a logistic regression:
ln ½p=ð1  pÞ ¼ a þ b1 A þ b2 S þ gX

(1)

where A is an indicator variable for any water contact, S is
a dichotomous indicator variable for exposure greater than or
equal to some level of water contact (body immersion, head
immersion, swallowed water), and X is a vector of potentially
confounding covariates (see below). We estimated the relative
risk of illness due to swim exposure using the odds ratio (OR),
^2 ). Thus the comparison group
^1 þ b
estimated as OR ¼ exp (b
for these analyses was non-swimmers: individuals who had
no contact with ocean water during their day at the beach.
In our analyses of the relationships between FIB concentrations and health outcomes, our goal was first to identify
a set of conditions under which the traditional indicators
appeared to have the expected relationships to health
outcomes, especially gastrointestinal symptoms, as reported
in prior studies (Wade et al., 2006, 2008, 2010). The conditions
we examined included berm status (open, closed, and all days
combined), level of participant exposure to water (body
immersion, head immersion, swallowed water), specific
health symptoms (detailed in 2.5 above) and indicator averaging method. Based on these exploratory analyses, we chose
to use a site-specific daily average (one of nine averaging
methods that we considered). We estimated site-specific daily
averages by calculating the geometric mean of the indicator
concentration levels over the 8:00 AM, 12 Noon, and 3 PM
samples for each of the five sampling sites. Each swimmer
was assigned the average indicator value for the sampling site
nearest to where the individual reported swimming.
FIB concentrations were log10 transformed for the analysis
because they were right-skewed. When indicator values were
below the level of detection (LOD) for a given assay results
were set equal to 10 per 100 ml. We also explored other
imputation methods by substituting the LOD, the LOD/2, and
LOD/SQRT(2). We restricted the population for each analysis
to swimmers with a defined level of water contact. The
probability of illness, p, was modeled for all berm days
combined using logistic regression:
ln ½p=ð1  pÞ ¼ a þ bI ¼ gX

(2)

where I is a continuous measure of the site-specific daily
average for the indicator of interest and X is a vector of
potentially confounding covariates. All ORs were estimated as
^ and, thus estimate the increase in risk for a one
OR ¼ exp ðbÞ
unit change on the log10 scale of the indicator concentration
among swimmers with a defined water exposure level.
The probability of illness, p, on berm-open and bermclosed days was modeled using logistic regression with
a berm-indicator interaction term:
ln ½p=1  p ¼ a þ bI þ gXþdBþ4ðI  BÞ

(3)



w a t e r r e s e a r c h 4 6 ( 2 0 1 2 ) 2 1 7 6 e2 1 8 6

where I and X are equivalent to equation (2), B is a dichotomous indicator of berm status (open ¼ 1, closed ¼ 0) and I * B is
an interaction term between indicator concentration and
berm status. ORs for berm-closed days were estimated from
^ and for berm-open days as
equation (3) as OR ¼ exp (b)
^þ4
^ ), and estimate the increase in risk for a one
OR ¼ exp (b
unit change on the log10 scale of the indicator concentration
among swimmers with a defined water exposure level. The
coefficient (^
4) and associated p-value were used to test
whether the interaction term differed from 0, and thus
whether the association between an indicator concentration
and health differed by berm status. Both models (2) and (3)
assume that the association between indicators and illness
is linear on the log-odds scale.
Models were adjusted for covariates, X, that were associated with the outcome or judged to be potential confounders:
study year, age, sex, race, swimming on multiple days, allergies, contact with animals, contact with other sick people,
frequency of beach visits, digging in the sand, and consumption of raw or undercooked eggs or meat. All covariates, except
age and frequency of beach visits, were categorized as 1 or 0.
Race was dichotomized as white or nonwhite. Consistent with
prior recreational water analyses (Coford et al., 2007; Wade
et al., 2006, 2008, 2010), we selected a subset of these covariates for each model using a change in estimate algorithm,
which retains covariates that change the estimated OR by at
least 5% when removed from a multivariable specification
(Rothman and Greenland, 1998 ). We estimated the 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for the ORs using robust standard
errors (Freedman, 2010) that allow for correlated observations
within household, but assume that households are independent. The decision to examine the health-indicator relationships stratified by berm status (berm-open, berm-closed, and
all days combined) was planned prior to the initiation of the
study. The “berm-open” analyses provide estimates of
indicator-health relationships under poor water quality
conditions; the “combined” analyses provide estimates of the
indicator-health relationships averaged over the mix of berm
conditions as would be typical for use of FIB at this beach.

10 CFU/100 mL on berm-closed days. Similarly, 5% of samples
from the same site exceeded single sample WQS on bermclosed days compared to 71% on berm-open days (data not
shown).

3.2.

Population characteristics

We approached 6686 eligible households. Of these, 4499
households (67%) agreed to participate and completed the
beach interview, and 3587 households completed the twoweek follow-up interview. Of 9525 individuals completing
the study, 62% were swimmers (Table 1). Among individuals
completing the study, 21% failed to complete beach interviews
on-site (while at the beach) and were contacted by phone
within 3 days of their visit, consistent with Coford et al. (2007).
No differences were found in reported swim exposures by
beach interview format (on-site vs. phone) or in the basic
demographics of the two groups (data not shown). We
collected limited data on those who enrolled but could not be
located for follow-up; we did not observe notable differences
(“lost to follow-up” in Tables 1 and 2).

Health outcomes for swimmers compared to nonswimmers

Results

Among the 3585 non-swimmers at Doheny Beach, 3.49% had
an episode of diarrhea in the 10e14 days following their visit
(Table 3); this is comparable to the estimated 3.26% endemic
12-day prevalence of diarrhea in the United States (Scallan
et al., 2005). The incidence of diarrhea following the beach
visit was significantly higher for body immersion (4.58%), head
immersion (4.59%) and those who swallowed water (6.13%)
than among those with no contact. The adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) for diarrhea among swimmers compared to nonswimmers increased with increasing water exposure: body
immersion (aOR ¼ 1.38, 95% CI 1.03e1.86); head immersion
(aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.07e1.99); and swallowed water (aOR 1.90,
95% CI 1.29e2.80). Similar patterns were observed for HCGI.
We also collected information on non-gastrointestinal
outcomes (see Supplemental Material, Tables 1e4 and 6e9).
Generally these symptoms were less frequently observed than
diarrhea and HCGI.

Water quality

3.4.

A total of 481 water samples were collected and analyzed.
Overall, Enterococcus concentrations by EPA 1600 ranged from
<2 to 41,000 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL. Overall, 17%
of the samples exceeded the single sample marine water
quality standard (WQS) of 104 CFU/100 ml for Enterococcus as
determined by EPA Method 1600. At least 10% of the samples
exceeded the standard at each of the three sampling sites
located near the creek (see sites A, B, and D in Supplemental
Material, Figure 1). Water quality at Doheny Beach differed
significantly when the sand berm restraining San Juan Creek
was closed compared to when open and the creek flowed
untreated into beach waters (see Supplemental Material,
Figure 2). Examining the site directly in front of the creek,
median Enterococcus concentrations as measured by EPA1600
were 316 CFU/100 mL on berm-open days compared to

Associations of indicators with diarrhea and HCGI

The strongest associations between levels of FIB and diarrhea
among swimmers were seen among those with highest level
of water exposure (“swallowed water“) on berm-open days
(Table 4). For example, log10 increases in Enterococcus CFU
measured by EPA Method 1600 were associated with an aOR of
2.50 (95% CI 1.52e4.11), fecal coliforms had an aOR of 2.30 (95%
CI 1.48e-3.59) and TaqMan qPCR had an aOR of 2.34 (95% CI
1.13e4.84) when swimmers swallowed water on berm-open
days. Berm-open ORs were consistently higher than bermclosed and berm-combined ORs. For each indicator, we
report P-values for a test of interaction between indicator
concentration and berm status (comparing open and closed
estimates from the interaction model). The tests of interaction
suggest that indicator-health associations differ by
berm status, in particular among swimmers that swallowed

the association of traditional and rapid measurements of FIB
with gastrointestinal illness (Table 5). Alternate LOD imputation methods were explored for indicator analyses, but did not
alter conclusions (see Supplemental Material, Tables 10e12
for LOD/2; other results not shown.)

Lagged analysis (EPA 1600)

In current beach monitoring practice, the 24 h incubation time
needed for culture-based methods means that water quality
results are not available until the day following collection. We
therefore repeated our epidemiological analyses lagging
culture-based exposure by one day to account for laboratory
processing time (i.e. measuring the association between FIB
on a given day and illness among swimmers the following
day). In these analyses (Supplemental Material, Table 13) we
found no significant associations between prior-day FIB and
illness. For example, with berm-open the aOR for diarrhea was
1.30 (95% CI, 0.66e2.52) among swimmers with head
immersion.

3.6.

Dichotomized analysis (EPA 1600)

In current practice, single samples measuring EPA 1600 are
typically reported as values above or below 104 CFU/100 ml.
As a further check on the internal consistency of our findings,
we dichotomized site-specific daily average values for log10
EPA 1600 at 2.017, corresponding to a concentration of
104 CFU/ml. We then took this dichotomized variable and
measured the association with diarrhea and HCGI. We found
strong associations between exposure and illness when
specifying Enterococcus in this manner (see Supplemental
Material, Tables 14 and 15). For example, among the small
subsample of those who swallowed water (N ¼ 181) on bermopen days, the aOR for diarrhea was 8.66 (95% CI 1.89e39.81)
for those exposed to EPA 1600 levels above 104 CFU/100 ml
compared to those exposed to levels below 104 CFU/100 ml.

our study was observational rather than randomized and

swimmers as “negative controls” (Lipsitch et al., 2010): we
explored the association between average FIB concentrations
at the beach for a given day and gastrointestinal illness
among non-swimmers who visited the same day (who did
not contact water, and were unlikely to be exposed to
waterborne pathogens). In comparison with the indicatorillness associations seen among swimmers (Tables 4 and 5)
there appear to be no patterns in the associations between
FIB concentrations and gastrointestinal outcomes among
non-swimmers (see Supplemental Material, Table 16). This
suggests that health associations with FIB concentrations
(both traditional and rapid) observed among swimmers are
unlikely to be an artifact of unmeasured confounding, or our
estimation approach.

3.8.

Daily incidence of diarrhea

Swimmers reported a markedly different pattern of diarrhea
incidence than non-swimmers following their beach visit
(see Supplemental Material, Figure 3). Among swimmers,

diarrhea rates were strongly elevated two days postexposure relative to non-swimmers. Furthermore, these
increases among swimmers were consistent with a doseeresponse relationship; the greatest elevation seen among
swimmers who swallowed water, followed by swimmers
with head immersion, and finally swimmers with body
immersion.

3.9.

Morning vs. afternoon sampling

As described in Methods (Section 2.7), we assigned indicator
values to swimmers using the site-specific daily average of all
morning and afternoon sample-values for the site nearest to
the swimmer’s area of immersion. To evaluate the impact of
the timing of water sampling on indicator-health relationships, we analyzed the morning and afternoon samples
separately (see Supplemental Material, Tables 17e20). Across
all point estimates for the indicators, there appeared to be
a stronger relationship to health when analyzing the morning
rather than the afternoon samples.

Although the principal goal of our study was to measure
associations between FIB concentrations and gastrointestinal
illnesses, we also measured associations between FIB
concentrations and non-gastrointestinal health outcomes,
including respiratory, eye, ear, and skin complaints. Because
these outcomes were less frequently reported, we show only
the data for swimmers who placed their heads under water
(see Supplemental Material, Tables 21e27). Unlike associations seen for the indicators with diarrhea and highly credible
gastrointestinal illness, there were no clear patterns of
indicator-illness associations.

Discussion

4.1.

Summary

The associations we observed were similar between the
culture-based and qPCR methods, but this is based on analyses assessing health relationships with samples collected on
the same day that swimmers were in the water. We found that
the indicator-health associations for the culture-based
methods were no longer significant (nor was there a pattern
of increasing odds ratios with increasing swimmer exposure)
when the results were lagged by one day, typical of current
beach monitoring practice. Thus, while these methods theoretically provide comparable levels of health protection, qPCR
could provide a substantial advantage in practical application
if rapid results were used to make decisions about health-risk
management on the same day.

4.4.
We found that swimmers at Doheny Beach in the summers of
2007 and 2008 experienced diarrhea at a significantly
increased rate compared to non-swimmers. Additionally,
although it was not a primary focus of our study, we found
increased rates of eye infections and earaches among swimmers. We found strong associations between several FIB
quantification approaches and diarrhea, with evidence that
these associations differed by berm status. Additionally, the
data suggest an increasing doseeresponse relationship; the
strongest associations were seen for those who reported
swallowing water, especially on berm-open days. The associations of the FIB concentrations, using rapid molecular
assays, with gastrointestinal health outcomes were similar to
those of the traditional culture-based assays when examined
under the same berm conditions. The pattern of time to
diarrhea onset among swimmers (strong peak at 2 days)
appears to be different from that seen among non-swimmers.
Using non-swimmers as “negative controls” we saw no relationship between FIB and diarrhea among individuals with no
water contact, further strengthening the suggestion that the
associations observed between traditional and rapid indicators and illness among swimmers were not spurious findings
related to our observational design.

4.2.

Berm status: open, closed and all days combined

Our observation of a large difference in the associations
between measures of Enterococcus and illness when the berm
was open compared to berm-closed days, and all days
combined could indicate a different FIB source between the
different conditions. Boehm et al. (2004) suggested that FIB can
transport through sand, but the transport of contaminated
material to the beach is more rapid when the berm is open,
reducing time for degradation and inactivation of FIB and
pathogens alike. Additionally when the berm is closed, sand
can filter out pathogens and Enterococcus, and appears to be
impacting the association between Enterococcus densities and
adverse health effects often seen among swimmers proximate
to direct, flowing sources. More research is needed on the
differential fate and transport impacts of pathogens and FIB

Lagged analyses

Morning vs. afternoon results

The processing lag for qPCR is less than for culture-based
methods, but there is still about six hours from morning
sample collection to when warnings are issued in the afternoon. Our results suggest that the effect of this 6-hr lag would
be minimal, though, as we found that the odds ratios for
samples collected in the morning were more likely to be
statistically significant than those for samples collected in the
afternoon (see Supplemental Material, Tables 17e20). This is
in apparent contrast with rapid changes in bacterial concentrations that have been observed at some beaches (Boehm
et al., 2002). A likely explanation is that the morning
samples better represent the average swimmer’s exposure
compared to afternoon samples. This may be due to solar
inactivation, which alters the relationship between FIB and
the pathogens with which they co-occur (Davies-Colley et al.,
1994; Noble et al., 2004; Sinton et al., 2007). This is consistent
with our observation of consistently lower Enterococcus
concentrations in the afternoon samples compared to
morning samples (data not shown).

4.5.

Differences in rapid indicators

We evaluated three qPCR assays that utilize primer-probe sets
specific for Enterococcus and found little difference in their
associations with illness. Two (TaqMan and Scorpion-1) used
primer-probe sets targeting a gene sequence similar to that of
Ludwig and Schleifer (2000) and are intended to quantify the
broad range of Enterococcus species enumerated by EPA 1600
(Moore et al., 2008). The similarity in odds ratios between these
two methods is consistent with several studies finding they
yield similar Enterococcus concentrations (Griffith et al., 2009;
Noble et al., 2010). The third primer-probe set (Scorpion-2)
was a modified design intended to more specifically amplify E.
facaelis and E. faecium, species thought to be important in
human fecal contamination. The lack of difference in health
relationships for this third method may result from the fecal
sources at the site already having high concentrations of these
species. Alternatively, it may result from the Scorpion-2
primer-probe design not being exclusionary and still



2184

w a t e r r e s e a r c h 4 6 ( 2 0 1 2 ) 2 1 7 6 e2 1 8 6

amplifying a wide array of species, as suggested by the
concentration correlations with the other two methods
observed over a range of sample types (Noble et al., 2010).

4.6.

Previous studies

Most bathing water epidemiology studies investigating municipal wastewater effluent-impacted waters, and studies examining the health risks from exposure to land-based runoff are
equivocal. Schoen and Ashbolt (2010) used quantitative microbial risk assessment to show that non-point source runoffaffected beaches present considerably less health risk than
those affected by wastewater, which is consistent with several
studies that found no relationship between GI illness and
increasing levels of Enterococci at beaches without known
sources of sewage (Calderon et al., 1991; Coford et al., 2007;
Fleisher et al., 2010). In contrast, McBride et al. (1998) found
health risk from human and animal fecal material were not
substantially different. Similarly, Haile et al. (1999) found
increased health risk for several health outcomes (including
fever, chills, cough, ear discharge and respiratory disease
although not for HCGI-1 and HCGI-2) from swimming in proximity to urban runoff sources; these runoff source were known
to contain human sources of fecal contamination based on the
presence of human enteric viruses. Despite the separation of
sanitary from storm-water runoff pipes and conduits in
southern California, our study also provides an equivocal
answer. When the berm was open, we observed associations
between Enterococcus and health outcomes that were consistent
with those seen in studies conducted near wastewater effluent
(Wade et al., 2010). In contrast, these associations were weak
when the berm status was not taken into account. The United
States Environmental Protection Agency has committed to
a new water quality standard by October 2012. Boehm et al.
(2009) noted that some have suggested the potential establishment of different standards for beaches without direct impact
from human fecal sources. Findings from our study suggest that
while this option may be possible, the contamination source
and delivery must be well understood, as FIB-illness relationships can vary between conditions even within a beach.

4.7.

Limitations

There are potential limitations when evaluating our results.
Although multiple attempts were made to contact all participants, 22% of participants could not be reached. We have no
data to suggest that this introduced a systematic bias into our
findings as the baseline enrollment characteristics of those who
completed the study and those who did not are similar. The
final number of participants completing the study (9525) was
less than the 12,230 we had initially hoped to enroll. Enrollment
was impacted by weather conditions that reduced beach usage
during the months of our study and conceivably could have
limited our ability to detect indicator-health associations for
less frequently observed outcomes. We assigned exposure to
each participant based on the FIB concentrations collected at
the site closest to where that participant swam. Although this
may not represent each individual’s actual exposure, the
internal consistency of the results (increased illness when
water quality was poor during open-berm conditions, markedly

different daily incidence pattern for swimmers and nonswimmers, increasing illness with increasing exposure) does
not suggest a systematic bias. Although indicator exposure was
not randomly assigned in our study, neither participants nor
investigators had knowledge of water quality results during
water exposure. Finally, our results must be interpreted with
the understanding that we estimated and report numerous
(indicator and health outcome) associations.

5.

Conclusions

Our data suggest an increased risk of swimming-associated
gastrointestinal illness at this urban runoff contaminated
beach. When the source of FIB consistently exceeded water
quality standards (berm-open), traditional and rapid methods
for Enterococcus were both strongly related to illness. When the
source of FIB was diffuse (berm status not adjusted for), fewer
significant associations were measured. These differences in
relationships between FIB and illness, even at a single beach,
demonstrate that it can be difficult to consistently predict FIBhealth associations at urban runoff impacted beaches using
currently available indicators.
