INTRODUCTION
Statistical data on the occurrence and causes of waterborne
disease outbreaks (WBDOs) in the United States have been
collected and reported since 1920 (10, 12, 14, 46). Since 1971,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have maintained the collaborative Waterborne Disease and Outbreak
Surveillance System (WBDOSS) and periodically reported
these data (47). In this article, we review WBDOs associated
with water intended for drinking, water not intended for drinking, and water of unknown intent reported to the surveillance
system during 1971 to 2006. We have included all reported
outbreaks and cases associated with exposure to drinking water—through ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact—and all
types of illness acquired from exposure to drinking water, including acute gastrointestinal illness (e.g., cryptosporidiosis
and giardiasis), acute respiratory illness (e.g., legionellosis),
skin infections (e.g., Pseudomonas), neurological illness (e.g.,
primary amebic meningoencephalitis), and inflammation of
the liver (e.g., hepatitis A). Excluded from this review are all
reported outbreaks and cases associated with recreational water use.
Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance
Public health departments in U.S. states, territories, localities, and Freely Associated States (i.e., the Republic of the
Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the

Republic of Palau) have primary responsibility for detecting
and investigating outbreaks and cases of disease. Outbreaks
associated with exposures to drinking, recreational, and other
types of water are voluntarily reported to the CDC.
For an outbreak to be defined as a WBDO, two or more
persons must have experienced a similar illness after exposure
to water and be epidemiologically linked by time and by location of exposure to water. Furthermore, the epidemiologic
evidence must implicate water as the probable source of
illness. For inclusion in the WBDOSS, CDC and EPA classify reported outbreaks according to the strength of the
evidence implicating water as the vehicle of transmission
(Table 1). Epidemiologic data are weighted more heavily
than water quality data. Outbreaks without water quality
data are included, but reports that lack epidemiologic data
are not.
The primary unit of analysis for this surveillance system is
the outbreak, but single cases of selected waterborne diseases
are also reported when waterborne transmission is certain
(e.g., single cases of chemical poisoning when water quality
data indicate water contamination by the chemical). Although
single cases are analyzed separately from outbreaks for
WBDOSS surveillance reports, they are included in the outbreak analyses for this review. WBDOs caused by Legionella
and resulting in legionellosis (i.e., Legionnaires’ disease) are
also included, even though they have been reported to
WBDOSS only since 2001. Single cases of legionellosis are
captured in a separate surveillance system at CDC (3) and are
not included in this review.

When an infectious etiologic agent is identified, the genus is
reported along with any other details that are available, including the species, serotype, serogroup, serovar, genotype, and
subtype. In this review, the absence of species names or other
descriptors indicates that only the genus name was reported. It
is not a requirement that infectious etiologic agents be identified or fully characterized to be included in WBDOSS.
WBDOs with no reported etiologic agent (e.g., specimens
not collected or specimens analyzed but no agent ascertained) were labeled as having an undetermined etiology
and included in all analyses.
During 1971 to 2006, multiple versions of a standard form
were used to collect information about WBDOs. The initial
form was designed for food-borne disease outbreak reporting
(HSM 4.245-NCDC) and was replaced with a WBDO-specific
form in 1975 (CDC 4.461, renamed CDC 52.12 in 1981). The
CDC 52.12 form was developed to solicit data on characteristics of the outbreak (e.g., cases, time, and location), results
from epidemiologic investigations and studies, results from
clinical specimens and water sample testing, and other potential contributing factors (e.g., environmental concerns, disinfection deficiencies, and filtration problems). Formal investigative reports were frequently submitted with the reporting
forms to provide supplemental information for many WBDOs
and were the only information available for many of the
WBDOs in the early years of the surveillance system. CDC
maintains files of these paper-based outbreak forms and reports and also has an internal electronic database housing
these data. In 2009, waterborne disease outbreak reporting
was transitioned from paper-based reporting to electronic
reporting through the National Outbreak Reporting System
(NORS), a state-accessible electronic system maintained at
CDC that also includes food-borne, person-to-person, and
animal-to-person outbreaks. NORS will provide enhanced
and timelier data collection for public health agencies and
waterborne disease researchers.
METHODS OF OUTBREAK EVALUATION
Outbreak Characterization and Classification
Recently, we conducted an extensive evaluation of all
WBDOs associated with drinking water, water not intended for
drinking, and water of unknown intent in the WBDOSS database. Because specific guidelines for inclusion of an outbreak

Not provided or inadequate

in the surveillance system were first applied to WBDOs occurring in 1989 (15) and have been revised since then, the earlier
WBDOs were reevaluated to ensure the adequacy and consistency of the epidemiologic information needed for inclusion in
the surveillance system based on current requirements. In addition, definitions and other parameters have been expanded
in recent years to better reflect the changing epidemiology of
waterborne disease (23, 47), and it was necessary to apply the
changed definitions to earlier WBDOs (Table 2). For example,
only one etiologic agent was documented for WBDOs reported
during 1971 to 2002, whereas WBDOs reported after 2002 are
documented as having more than one etiologic agent if multiple pathogens or chemicals are identified and if each agent is
identified in ⱖ5% of all positive clinical specimens (e.g., stool
samples). All WBDOs have been reevaluated for additional
etiologic agents using the current definition. Outbreaks that
have multiple etiologic agents of the same agent type (i.e.,
bacterial, chemical, parasitic, or viral), are included in analyses
for that agent type, whereas outbreaks that have etiologic
agents of more than one agent type are excluded from analyses
of single-agent types and are analyzed separately as mixedagent outbreaks. A similar approach has been applied to outbreaks with more than one illness type (e.g., acute gastrointestinal illness and hepatitis). Only the predominant illness type
was documented during 1971 to 2002; outbreaks that occurred
during this time period have now been reclassified as mixed
illness when illness symptoms clustered into more than one illness type and were reported by ⱖ50% of patients. Mixedillness outbreaks are analyzed separately from single-illness
outbreaks. Likewise, outbreaks have been further evaluated
for the involvement of more than one water source (e.g., both
groundwater and surface water), and mixed-source outbreaks
have been separated from single-source outbreaks for analyses.
WBDOs are assigned water system deficiencies that summarize the contributing factors and events associated with individual outbreaks. Substantial modifications to the water system
deficiency classifications were assigned to WBDOs reported
for 2003 to 2006 to provide better data for public health prevention and response efforts (23, 47). The revised deficiency
classifications have now been applied to WBDOs reported for
1971 to 2002, providing greater detail concerning the points of
contamination and the circumstances responsible for contamination. Outbreaks associated with more than one deficiency
are no longer restricted to the primary deficiency when multi-

TABLE 2. Timeline of WBDOSS definitions and inclusion criteria for drinking water

Reporting period

WBDOSS definitions and inclusion criteria

1971–1972 ...............WBDOSS initiated: “outbreak” defined as two or more cases epidemiologically linked to consumption of water from
municipal, semipublic or individual water systems; individual water system defined as wells or springs used exclusively
by single residences in areas without municipal systems
1974 .........................Inclusion of single cases of chemical poisoning when drinking water was demonstrated to be contaminated by a chemical
1976 .........................Individual water systems redefined as wells or springs used by a single residence or several residences or by persons
traveling outside populated areas
1979 .........................Drinking water systems redefined as community systems, noncommunity systems, and individual systems
1989–1990 ...............Total no. of cases redefined to exclude secondary cases
1991–1992 ...............Specific exclusion of outbreaks due to contamination of water or ice at point of use
1995–1996 ...............Estimated case count used instead of actual case count when the study population was randomly sampled or the
estimated count was calculated using the attack rate
1999–2000 ...............Inclusion of outbreaks associated with occupational water; inclusion of water not intended for drinking and bottled
water in individual water systems
2001–2002 ...............Inclusion of outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease
2003–2004 ...............Introduction of expanded deficiency classifications that capture point-of-use outbreaks except contamination of ice;
removal of water not intended for drinking and bottled water outbreaks from individual water system classification;
revision to definition of etiologic agent (multiple etiologies listed when each agent individually represents ⱖ5% of
positive specimens); “unidentified” is now used instead of “AGI” to identify acute gastrointestinal illness of unknown
etiology; illness types listed when ⱖ50% of patients reported a symptom in that category
2005–2006 ...............Deficiency classifications expanded to include a deficiency whereby current treatment is not expected to remove a
chemical contaminant; single cases excluded from analyses of outbreaks

ple deficiencies have been identified; all deficiencies associated
with an outbreak are now included. WBDOs with no reported
deficiencies (e.g., deficiencies not investigated, deficiencies investigated but not ascertained, and known deficiencies not
reported) have been labeled as having unknown deficiencies.
For analysis purposes, these unknown deficiencies are included
in the denominators unless otherwise noted. In the new deficiency classification, a clear distinction is made between contamination occurring at or in the source water, water treatment
facility, or water distribution system versus contamination at
the point of use (e.g., contaminated taps, hoses, or containers)
and other points not under the jurisdiction of a public water
utility (e.g., contamination of premise plumbing). This distinction allows for separate analyses of outbreaks associated with
contamination of the water mains and storage facilities within
the distribution system (e.g., infrastructure before the water
meter or the customer’s property line) and outbreaks associated with contamination of premise plumbing (e.g., pipes and
storage facilities after the customer’s property line or within
buildings). Contamination of distribution water mains can occur due to broken or leaky water pipes, cross-connections, back
siphonage, or corrosion. Premise plumbing deficiencies not
only include similar sources of contamination but also include
contamination associated with premise water treatment and
with devices and equipment using or distributing water (such
as drink mix machines). WBDOs due to Legionella colonization of premise plumbing systems (e.g., in heated water systems) are analyzed separately from other premise plumbing
WBDOs.
The classification of drinking water systems in WBDOSS
was revised in 1979 to reflect definitions of the Safe Drinking
Water Act (SDWA), and appropriate changes were made for
outbreaks reported during 1971 to 1978 (9). Drinking water
systems are either public or nonpublic. Public water systems,
which may be publicly or privately owned, are defined and
regulated by EPA under this act. Public water systems are
further classified as community or noncommunity systems. A

community water system is a public system that serves at least
15 service connections used by year-round residents or that
regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents. A noncommunity system is a public system that is not a community
system but makes water available for public use (e.g., schools,
restaurants, campgrounds, highway rest stations, and parks
with their own water systems). An individual system does not
meet the EPA definition of a public water system. It typically
serves a single family or farm and might regularly provide
water for as many as 24 persons or 14 connections. Individual
systems are not subject to EPA regulations but may be regulated at the state level. Approximately 15 million households in
the United States rely on individual water systems that are
privately owned (19, 36). In past WBDOSS reports and surveillance summaries, WBDOs associated with commercially
bottled water, bulk water purchases, and water not intended
for drinking were included with WBDOs associated with individual water systems for analysis purposes. Commercially bottled water is subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and not the EPA. However, the FDA
regulations generally follow EPA regulations. Since 2003, outbreaks associated with commercially bottled water, bulk water
purchases, and water not intended for drinking have been
classified and analyzed as their own water system categories;
WBDOs involving mixed water system types have also been
identified and analyzed as such. All outbreaks reported to the
WBDOSS during 1971 to 2006 were reevaluated for consistent
application of current water system classifications.
Nonrecreational outbreaks associated with water not intended for drinking (e.g., lakes, springs, and creeks used by
campers and boaters; irrigation water; and other nonpotable
sources with or without taps) and outbreaks associated with
water of unknown intent are analyzed separately from outbreaks associated with drinking water. WBDOs occurring
aboard cruise ships operating from U.S. ports are not included
in the WBDOSS (47).

outbreaks that occurred in Puerto Rico (n ⫽ 8), the Virgin Islands (n ⫽ 2), the Northern Mariana Islands (n ⫽ 1), Palau (n ⫽ 1), and the Republic
of the Marshall Islands (n ⫽ 1) are not shown in the state outbreak counts but are included in the total outbreak count. Two multistate outbreaks
(Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia; Pennsylvania and
Delaware), which are highlighted on the map using blue pentagons and red triangles, respectively, did not contribute to individual state counts.
Numbers are dependent on reporting and surveillance activities in individual states and do not necessarily indicate that more outbreaks occurred
in a given state.

Statistical Analyses
WBDOSS data were analyzed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC). Trends in counts over time were investigated
using Poisson regression. Trends in proportions were analyzed
using logistic regression. Exact logistic regression was used
when data were too sparse or skewed to assume large sample
approximations. The chi-square test for equality of proportions
was used to assess seasonal differences. Statistical significance
was defined as a P value of ⬍0.0500.
OUTBREAK CHARACTERIZATION AND TRENDS
A total of 833 outbreaks associated with drinking water,
water not intended for drinking, and water of unknown intent;
577,991 cases of illness; and 106 deaths reported during 1971 to
2006 met the criteria for inclusion in WBDOSS and are included in this review. WBDOs were reported in 48 states,
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana
Islands, Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands

(Fig. 1). Included in the count of outbreaks are 15 single-case
events where acute symptoms occurred shortly after water consumption and high levels of chemicals were identified in the
water. Almost all of the reported outbreaks (n ⫽ 780 [93.6%],
including 15 single-case chemical events), cases (n ⫽ 577,094,
99.8%), and deaths (n ⫽ 93, 87.7%) were associated with the
contamination of drinking water. Forty-seven outbreaks
(5.6%), 861 cases (0.1%), and 13 deaths (12.3%) were associated with water not intended for drinking; six outbreaks (0.7%)
and 36 cases (⬍0.1%) were associated with water of unknown
intent. The outbreaks reported for each of these three categories of water are analyzed separately in separate sections. The
primary focus of the review is on drinking water outbreaks.

sites (n ⫽ 153, 18.4%) and non-Legionella bacteria (n ⫽ 113,
13.6%). Fewer outbreaks were caused by chemicals (n ⫽ 90,
10.8%) or viruses (n ⫽ 66, 7.9%). Although WBDOs of legionellosis have been reported only since 2001, Legionella was
identified as the etiology of 38 outbreaks. The largest outbreak
reported since 1920 occurred in Milwaukee in 1993 and was
associated with drinking water; Cryptosporidium hominis was
eventually identified as the etiologic agent (32, 35, 48). Investigators estimated that 403,000 illnesses (24), 4,400 hospitalizations (8), and 50 deaths (16) were associated with this single
outbreak. Deaths associated with other outbreaks were primarily due to bacterial pathogens: Legionella spp. (25 deaths),
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (7 deaths), Vibrio
cholerae O1 (6 deaths), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (6 deaths),
and Shigella spp. (2 deaths). Six deaths were attributed to
chemicals: arsenic (two deaths), fluoride (two deaths), ethylene
glycol (one death), and nitrate (one death). Two deaths were
attributed to primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by
Naegleria fowleri (4, 25) after exposure to drinking water; the
exposure route was thought to be inhalation rather than ingestion. One death was attributed to norovirus. One death occurred in an outbreak of undetermined etiology.
Water system deficiencies. A total of 854 deficiencies were
identified in the 833 WBDOs. Single deficiencies were identified in 815 (97.8%) of the 833 outbreaks, and two or more
deficiencies were identified in 18 (2.2%) of the outbreaks.
Included in this total were 38 outbreaks with unknown deficiencies. These deficiencies are described in greater detail in
subsequent sections. The deficiency classifications in Table 5
make a clear distinction between outbreaks associated with
contamination at points under the jurisdiction of a public water
utility and those associated with contamination at points not
under the jurisdiction of a public water utility. Legionellosis
outbreaks are considered in separate categories according to
the types of water involved (i.e., drinking water, water not
intended for drinking, and water of unknown intent). WBDOs
associated with Legionella are analyzed separately because they
were not reported to WBDOSS prior to 2001 and they share
characteristics that are distinct from other types of outbreaks
(e.g., Legionella colonization of premise plumbing systems or
cooling towers and inhalation as the route of water exposure).

In this review, analyses of water system deficiency trends and
causes of premise plumbing outbreaks exclude legionellosis
outbreaks.
Outbreaks Associated with Drinking Water
Most (n ⫽ 680, 87.2%) of the 780 outbreaks associated with
drinking water occurred in public water supplies, either in
community (n ⫽ 338, 43.3%) or noncommunity (n ⫽ 342,
43.8%) water systems; 82 outbreaks (10.5%) occurred in individual water systems (Table 4). Eleven outbreaks (1.4%) were
associated with the use of commercially bottled water, and one
(0.1%) was associated with the purchase of bulk water used for
drinking.
Outbreaks occurred throughout the year (Fig. 2) in all system types. Outbreaks in community, noncommunity, and individual water systems showed seasonal trends (community, P ⫽
0.0002; noncommunity, P ⬍ 0.0001; and individual, P ⫽
0.0006) and were reported most frequently during the summer
from June to August, although there was no statistical difference between summer and fall among outbreaks in community
systems. Nine outbreaks were excluded from analyses of sea-

FIG. 2. Number of outbreaks associated with drinking water by system type and month (n ⫽ 762), 1971 to 2006, excluding outbreaks associated
with commercially bottled water (n ⫽ 11), bulk water purchase (n ⫽ 1), mixed water systems (n ⫽ 3), and unknown water systems (n ⫽ 3).

sonal effect: an outbreak associated with bulk water purchase,
three outbreaks in mixed water systems, three outbreaks with
unknown water system types, and two outbreaks with unknown
months of onset. Too few outbreaks were associated with commercially bottled water to evaluate a seasonal distribution.
Illnesses. During 1971 to 2006, 685 (87.8%) of the drinking
water outbreaks were associated with acute gastrointestinal
illness. The next most common illness type was hepatitis (n ⫽
29, 3.7%), followed by acute respiratory illness (n ⫽ 24, 3.1%
[all due to Legionella reported to WBDOSS since 2001]), skin
conditions (n ⫽ 5, 0.6%), and neurological illness (n ⫽ 1, 0.1%
[due to N. fowleri]). Ten (1.3%) of the drinking water outbreaks did not have illness types identified. The remaining
outbreaks were associated with mixed illness types (n ⫽ 15,
1.9%), methemoglobinemia (n ⫽ 5, 0.6%), miscarriages (n ⫽
2, 0.3%), or other illness types that were not easily categorized
(n ⫽ 4, 0.5%) (i.e., change in hair color, metabolic acidosis and
shock, fatigue and dizziness, and burning in the mouth).
Etiologic agents. An etiology was determined for 432
(55.4%) of the 780 outbreaks associated with drinking water
(Fig. 3), and no etiology was reported for 348 (44.6%) outbreaks. The most frequently identified etiologic agent types
were parasites (n ⫽ 143, 18.3%) and non-Legionella bacteria
(n ⫽ 105, 13.5%). Fewer outbreaks were caused by chemicals
(n ⫽ 90, 11.5%) and viruses (n ⫽ 64, 8.2%). Legionella was
identified as the etiology of 24 outbreaks reported during 2001
to 2006. Outbreaks involving multiple pathogens of the same
agent type (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella in a single
bacterial outbreak) occurred in bacterial and parasitic WBDOs.
None of the reported outbreaks involved multiple viral pathogens. Six outbreaks (0.8%) involved mixed agents (e.g., bacteria and parasites in the same outbreak). Three of the mixedagent outbreaks involved non-Legionella bacteria and parasites
(C. jejuni, Campylobacter lari, Cryptosporidium, and Helicobacter canadensis; C. jejuni, Entamoeba, and Giardia; and Salmonella and Giardia). The etiologic agents for the fourth

mixed-agent outbreak were noroviruses G1 and G2 and C.
jejuni. The etiologic agents for the fifth mixed-agent outbreak
were C. jejuni, norovirus, and Giardia intestinalis. The final
mixed-agent outbreak involved cases of self-limited acute gastroenteritis of undetermined etiology followed by the development of hepatitis A cases.
(i) Parasites. G. intestinalis was identified as the sole pathogen in 123 (86.0%) of the 143 drinking water outbreaks of
parasitic etiology. These Giardia outbreaks caused 28,127 cases
(6.3% of the 449,959 cases attributed to parasites). Cryptosporidium was identified as the sole pathogen in 13 parasitic drinking water outbreaks (9.1%), causing 421,301 cases (93.6%),
403,000 of which were attributed to a single outbreak of Cryptosporidium hominis in Milwaukee, WI (32, 35, 48). Two outbreaks and 63 cases were attributed to Entamoeba histolytica
and occurred in Missouri and Palau. Cyclospora caused a single

outbreak of 21 cases in Illinois (17). N. fowleri caused a single
outbreak of two cases in Arizona (4). In three outbreaks, more
than one parasite was identified: Cryptosporidium and Giardia
were identified in two outbreaks, and Giardia and E. histolytica
were identified in one outbreak.
(ii) Non-Legionella bacteria. Shigella was identified as the
sole pathogen in 44 of the 105 nonlegionellosis bacterial drinking water outbreaks (41.9%) and in 9,177 of the 22,446 nonlegionellosis bacterial cases (40.9%); 34 (77.3%) of the Shigella
outbreaks were caused by S. sonnei. Salmonella was identified
as the sole pathogen in 20 outbreaks (19.0%) and 3,588 cases
(16.0%), including 5 outbreaks of S. Typhi which occurred in
Washington (n ⫽ 2), Florida, Maryland, and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. Campylobacter was identified as the sole pathogen in
19 outbreaks (18.1%) and 5,565 cases (24.8%); 17 (89.5%) of
the Campylobacter outbreaks were caused by C. jejuni. Escherichia coli was identified as the sole pathogen in 12 outbreaks
(11.4%) and 2,901 cases (12.9%); 10 (83.3%) of the E. coli
outbreaks were caused by E. coli O157:H7. Two additional
sole-pathogen nonlegionellosis bacterial outbreaks were
caused by Pleisiomonas shigelloides (60 cases), and Yersinia
enterocolitica (2 cases). Non-O1 V. cholerae caused an outbreak
of 11 cases in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, and V. cholerae O1 caused an outbreak of 103 cases in
the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Multiple non-Legionella
bacterial pathogens were identified in six outbreaks, all of
which included C. jejuni. The bacteria that accompanied C.
jejuni included Shigella, P. shigelloides, Y. enterocolitica, E. coli
O157:H7, E. coli O145 and E. coli O157:H7, and other Campylobacter isolates that were not identified to the species level.
(iii) Viruses. Almost all of the 64 viral drinking water outbreaks were attributed to norovirus (n ⫽ 34, 53.1%) or hepatitis A virus (n ⫽ 29, 45.3%). Most of the 16,728 viral cases
were attributed to norovirus (n ⫽ 14,133, 84.5%); 834 cases

(5.0%) were attributed to hepatitis A outbreaks. Rotavirus
caused one outbreak (1.6%) and 1,761 cases (10.5%). There
were no reported viral outbreaks involving multiple viral
pathogens.
(iv) Chemicals. Copper was the sole chemical in 27 (30.0%)
of the 90 chemical outbreaks and in 369 (9.5%) of the 3,901
chemical cases. Fluoride was identified as the sole chemical in
11 outbreaks (12.2%) and 969 cases (24.8%). Nitrate was identified as the sole chemical in 8 outbreaks (8.9%) and cases 16
(0.4%). Thirty-eight additional single-chemical outbreaks occurred, causing 486 cases. Multiple chemicals were identified
in six outbreaks, three of which included copper accompanied
by fluoride, nitrate, or other minerals. The three remaining
multiple-chemical outbreaks involved exposure to chlordane, heptachlor, toxaphene, and kerosene; ethyl benzene,
toluene, and xylene; and bromate and other by-products of
disinfection.
Water system types. Although the annual number of reported drinking water outbreaks decreased considerably after
1980 (P ⬍ 0.0001), outbreaks continued to occur (Fig. 4).
When the outbreaks were analyzed by water system type, the
annual proportion of all drinking water outbreaks reported in
public water systems (community and noncommunity) was
found to decrease during 1971 to 2006 (P ⬍ 0.0001). In contrast, the annual proportion of drinking water outbreaks associated with individual water systems increased (P ⫽ 0.0002).
Trends in the outbreaks associated with commercially bottled
water, bulk water purchases, mixed water systems, and unknown water systems were not assessed because so few of these
outbreaks were reported.
Magnitude of outbreaks and strength of evidence classification. During 1971 to 2006, no change was observed in the mean
annual number of cases per outbreak for community water systems (excluding the Milwaukee outbreak), noncommunity sys-

More than one deficiency was identified during the investigation of some outbreaks.
Contamination of water and deficiencies occurring in the drinking water system at or in the water source, treatment facility, or distribution system of pipes and
storage facilities. For a community water system, the distribution system refers to the pipes and storage infrastructure prior to the water meter or property line; for
noncommunity and individual water systems, the distribution system refers to the pipes and storage infrastructure prior to entry into a house or other building (47).
c
Contamination of drinking water and deficiencies occurring in plumbing and pipes that are not part of the distribution system. For community systems, the
contamination occurred after the water meter or service connection; for noncommunity and individual water systems, contamination occurred in a service line leading
to a house or building or in the plumbing inside a house or other building (47).
b

tems, or individual systems. For outbreaks in community systems,
the average size of an outbreak during 1971 to 2006 was 340.5
cases per WBDO, excluding the Milwaukee outbreak. The average size of an outbreak in a noncommunity water system during
1971 to 2006 was 162.6 cases per WBDO. The average size of an
outbreak in an individual water system during 1971 to 2006 was
14.3 cases per WBDO.
The mean strength of evidence class designation for outbreaks associated with drinking water increased during 1989
(when such classification began) through 2006 (P ⬍ 0.0001).
The mean class designation for outbreaks in 1989 was 1.3 (class
1, adequate epidemiologic and water quality data). In contrast,
the mean class designation in 2006 was 2.4, with a peak in 2004
of 2.9 (class 2, adequate epidemiologic data but insufficient
water quality data; class 3, limited epidemiologic data but adequate water quality data).
Water system deficiencies. In the 780 WBDOs associated
with drinking water systems, investigators identified a single
deficiency in 725 WBDOs (92.9%) and two or more deficiencies in 18 WBDOs (2.3%). In the remaining 37 WBDOs
(4.7%), no deficiencies were reported; consequently, these outbreaks were categorized as having unknown deficiencies. The
801 deficiencies for the 780 WBDOs (Table 5) included the 37
WBDOs categorized as having unknown deficiencies. Also included in this total were the 24 outbreaks associated with

Legionella in the water system. Although Legionella grows in
biofilms in premise plumbing, Legionella outbreaks are considered separately from other premise plumbing deficiencies and
are described in a subsequent section of this review.
During the 36-year period, the majority (n ⫽ 422, 52.7%) of
the 801 deficiencies involved the use of contaminated groundwater, which had received either no treatment (n ⫽ 243, 30.
3%) or inadequate or interrupted treatment (n ⫽ 179, 22.3%)
(Fig. 5). The next most common category of deficiencies (n ⫽
148, 18.5%) involved the use of contaminated surface water,
which had received either no treatment (n ⫽ 21, 2.6%) or
inadequate or interrupted treatment (n ⫽ 127, 15.9%). Contamination within the distribution system and in premise
plumbing, not including legionellosis outbreaks, was also important, accounting for 79 (9.9%) and 65 (8.1%) of the deficiencies, respectively.
Commercially Bottled Water, Bulk Water,
and Point-of-Use Contamination
Commercially bottled water. Eleven outbreaks reported during 1971 to 2006 were associated with contaminated commercially bottled water. Four (36.4%) of these outbreaks were due
to inadequate treatment or contamination during the bottling
process, two (18.2%) were due to contamination at the point of

cases caused by V. cholerae O1 (2). This outbreak involved bulk
water that had been contaminated during hauling or storage.
Residents of Ebeye Island traveled by ferry to a neighboring
island to purchase water, which they transported back to Ebeye
Island in loosely sealed containers from which water was later
removed by opening the vessels.
Point of use. Twelve outbreaks were caused by contamination of water at its point of use. In addition to the two previously described commercially bottled water outbreaks involving point-of-use contamination, 10 outbreaks were associated
with water contaminated in containers, pitchers, bottles, hoses,
and hose bibs. All of these outbreaks resulted in acute gastrointestinal illness. In four outbreaks (40.0%), no etiologic
agents were identified. In the remaining six outbreaks, water
was contaminated by Shigella, Cryptosporidium parvum, G. intestinalis, norovirus (n ⫽ 2), or a chemical detergent.
Individual Water Systems

FIG. 5. Percentages of deficiencies (n ⫽ 801) in 780 outbreaks

groundwater where the treatment provided was not expected to remove the chemical contaminants.

use, and one (9.1%) was due to contamination during shipping
or storage. Insufficient information was available to characterize deficiencies for the other four commercially bottled water
outbreaks (36.4%).
All commercially bottled water outbreaks were associated
with acute gastrointestinal illness. Chemical contaminants
were identified in four outbreaks (36.4%); in one of these
WBDOs, investigators found illness associated with high levels
of bromate, a by-product of ozone disinfection. Bacterial contaminants were identified in two outbreaks (18.2%). In 1994,
non-O1 V. cholerae was responsible for an outbreak of 11 cases
when contamination occurred at a plant providing bottled water for a small community in the Northern Mariana Islands
(20). In 2000, S. sonnei was identified in an outbreak of 58
cases at a New Jersey school, which was associated with contamination of commercially bottled water during on-site storage. No etiologic agents were identified in the remaining five
outbreaks (45.5%).
One mixed-system outbreak reported in 2000 was associated
with both individual groundwater systems and commercially
bottled water (22). Some of the bottles of water were marketed
as water for infants, and others were marketed as spring water
taken from the same geographic area as the individual wells.
Investigators identified 95 cases of acute gastrointestinal illness
attributed to S. Bareilly in 10 states. In an epidemiologic investigation that involved 46 of these cases, the median age was
6 years and many of the patients were infants. This outbreak
was due to a combination of factors, including contamination
during the bottling process, use of untreated groundwater,
deficiencies in treatment of groundwater, and deficiencies in
building-specific water treatment.
Bulk water. In 2000, a single outbreak in the Republic of the
Marshall Islands resulted in 103 acute gastrointestinal illness

During the 36-year period, 82 outbreaks were associated
with contaminated water from individual systems.
Illnesses. The most common illnesses in individual systems
were acute gastrointestinal illness (n ⫽ 58, 70.7%) and hepatitis (n ⫽ 10, 12.2%). The remaining illnesses were classified as
other (n ⫽ 5, 6.1%), unknown (n ⫽ 5, 6.1%), or mixed (n ⫽ 4,
4.9%).
Etiologic agents. An etiology was determined for 55 (67.1%)
of the 82 outbreaks associated with individual water systems.
Non-Legionella bacteria (n ⫽ 18, 22.0%) were more frequently
identified than chemicals (n ⫽ 14, 17.1%), parasites (n ⫽ 12,
14.6%), or viruses (n ⫽ 10, 12.2%). One outbreak was of
mixed-agent etiology (self-limited acute gastroenteritis of undetermined etiology followed by hepatitis A). None of the
reported outbreaks in individual water systems were associated
with Legionella.
(i) Parasites. Ten (83.3%) of the 12 parasitic outbreaks had
G. intestinalis as the sole pathogen. Cryptosporidium was identified as the sole pathogen in one outbreak (8.3%). One multiple-parasite outbreak (8.3%) involved both Giardia and C.
parvum.
(ii) Non-Legionella bacteria. The etiologies of the 18 nonlegionellosis bacterial outbreaks included E. coli O157:H7 (n ⫽
4, 22.2%), S. Typhi (n ⫽ 3, 16.7%), S. sonnei (n ⫽ 3, 16.7%),
C. jejuni (N ⫽ 2, 11.1%), Shigella flexneri (n ⫽ 2, 11.1%), C.
jejuni and other Campylobacter isolates not identified to the
species level (n ⫽ 1, 5.6%), Shigella isolates not identified to
the species level (n ⫽ 1, 5.6%), Y. enterocolitica (n ⫽ 1, 5.6%),
and both C. jejuni and Shigella in one nonlegionellosis multiple-bacterium outbreak (5.6%).
(iii) Viruses. Hepatitis A virus was identified in all 10 viral
outbreaks that occurred in individual water systems.
(iv) Chemicals. Nitrate was the sole chemical identified in 7
of the 14 chemical outbreaks (50.0%), and copper was the sole
chemical in 2 outbreaks (14.3%). Arsenic, gasoline, phenol,
and selenium each caused one sole-chemical outbreak (7.1%).
One chemical outbreak (7.1%) involved both nitrate and
copper.
Locations. The majority of outbreaks in individual systems
occurred in private residences (n ⫽ 58, 70.7%) and in farms,
rural, or agricultural settings (n ⫽ 9, 11.0%).

CAUSES OF U.S. DRINKING WATER-ASSOCIATED OUTBREAKS

Water system deficiencies. In the 82 WBDOs associated with
individual water systems, investigators reported 80 deficiencies
in 78 (95.1%) of these WBDOs. In the remaining four individual water system WBDOs (4.9%), no deficiencies were reported; consequently, these outbreaks were categorized as having unknown deficiencies. The 84 deficiencies for the 82
WBDOs included the 4 WBDOs categorized as having unknown deficiencies.
The majority (n ⫽ 70, 83.3%) of the 84 deficiencies were due
to the use of contaminated untreated groundwater (n ⫽ 61,
72.6%) or deficiencies in treatment of contaminated groundwater (n ⫽ 9, 10.7%). The next most common deficiency category involved the use of contaminated, untreated surface water (n ⫽ 5, 6.0%); no treatment deficiencies associated with the
use of surface water were reported. The remaining deficiencies
included contamination in the distribution system (n ⫽ 4,
4.8%), contamination of premise plumbing (n ⫽ 1, 1.2%), and
unknown deficiencies (n ⫽ 4, 4.8%).

Public Water Systems
During the 36-year period, 680 outbreaks were associated
with contaminated water from public water systems: 338 outbreaks in community systems (49.7%) and 342 outbreaks in
noncommunity systems (50.3%).
Illnesses. Of the 338 community water system outbreaks,
282 (83.4%) were associated with acute gastrointestinal illness.
Other illness types included acute respiratory illness caused by
Legionella (n ⫽ 20, 5.9%), hepatitis A (n ⫽ 10, 3.0%), other
illness (caused by copper, ethylene glycol [n ⫽ 2], nitrate,
nitrite, and sodium hydroxide) (n ⫽ 6, 1.8%), skin conditions
(n ⫽ 4, 1.2%), and neurological illness caused by N. fowleri
(n ⫽ 1, 0.3%). Four (1.2%) of the community outbreaks did
not have an illness type identified. The remaining community
outbreaks were associated with mixed illness types (n ⫽ 11,
3.3%).
Of the 342 noncommunity water system outbreaks, 328
(95.9%) were associated with acute gastrointestinal illness. The
next most common illness type was hepatitis (n ⫽ 9, 2.6%),
followed by acute respiratory illness caused by Legionella (n ⫽
4, 1.2%); one noncommunity outbreak (0.3%) had an unknown illness type.
Etiologic agents: community systems. An etiology was determined for 244 (72.2%) of the 338 outbreaks associated with
community water systems. Parasites (n ⫽ 99, 29.3%) were
more frequently identified than chemicals (n ⫽ 60, 17.8%),
non-Legionella bacteria (n ⫽ 41, 12.1%), and viruses (n ⫽ 21,
6.2%). Three community outbreaks (0.9%) were of mixed etiology: C. jejuni, Entamoeba, and Giardia; C. jejuni, C. lari,
Helicobacter canadensis, and Cryptosporidium; and Salmonella
and Giardia. Legionella was associated with 20 (5.9%) of the
reported community outbreaks.
(i) Parasites. G. intestinalis was identified as the sole pathogen in most (n ⫽ 84, 84.8%) of the 99 parasitic outbreaks in
community systems. C. parvum (n ⫽ 9) or Cryptosporidium not
identified to the species level (n ⫽ 1) was identified in 10
sole-pathogen outbreaks (10.1%). Single outbreaks of E. histolytica (37), Cyclospora (17), and N. fowleri (4, 25) were also
reported. Two outbreaks (2.0%) involving multiple parasites

517

were identified; both involved G. intestinalis, one with E. histolytica and one with C. parvum.
(ii) Non-Legionella bacteria. Most of the 41 nonlegionellosis
bacterial outbreaks in community systems were due to Shigella
(n ⫽ 14, 34.1%), followed by Salmonella (n ⫽ 11, 26.8%),
Campylobacter (n ⫽ 11, 26.8%), and E. coli (n ⫽ 5, 12.2%). Of
the 14 outbreaks due to Shigella, S. sonnei was identified in 10
outbreaks (71.4%) and S. flexneri in two outbreaks (14.3%). Of
the 11 outbreaks due to Salmonella, S. Typhimurium was identified in 3 outbreaks (27.3%), S. Enteritidis in one outbreak
(9.1%), and S. Typhi in one outbreak (9.1%). The single outbreak of 60 cases of typhoid fever occurred in 1985 at a public
housing facility in the U.S. Virgin Islands (34). Of the 11
outbreaks due to Campylobacter, C. jejuni was identified in 9
outbreaks (81.8%). Of the five toxigenic E. coli outbreaks, E.
coli O157:H7 was identified in four outbreaks (80.0%).
(iii) Viruses. Of the 21 viral outbreaks in community water
systems, hepatitis A virus caused 10 outbreaks (47.6%), norovirus 10 outbreaks (47.6%), and rotavirus 1 outbreak (4.8%).
(iv) Chemicals. Of the 60 outbreaks due to chemical contamination in community systems, 23 (38.3%) were caused by
copper as the sole chemical, 6 (10.0%) were caused by fluoride,
and 6 (10.0%) were caused by sodium hydroxide. The remaining 25 outbreaks were caused by other chemical contaminants,
including two outbreaks (3.3%) that were caused by multiple
chemicals: chlordane, heptachlor, toxaphene, and kerosene;
and fluoride and copper.
Etiologic agents: noncommunity systems. In 221 (64.6%) of
the 342 outbreaks associated with noncommunity water systems an etiology was not determined. Non-Legionella bacteria
(n ⫽ 42, 12.3%) were more frequently identified than viruses
(n ⫽ 33, 9.7%), parasites (31, 9.1%), or chemicals (n ⫽ 10,
2.9%). One outbreak (0.3%) was of mixed-agent etiology (noroviruses G1 and G2 and C. jejuni). Legionella was associated
with 4 noncommunity outbreaks (1.2%).
(i) Parasites. G. intestinalis caused most (n ⫽ 28, 90.3%) of
the 31 parasitic outbreaks in noncommunity systems. C. parvum was identified in two outbreaks (6.5%), and E. histolytica
was identified in one outbreak (3.2%).
(ii) Non-Legionella bacteria. Shigella was identified as the
sole pathogen in 23 (54.8%) of the 42 nonlegionellosis bacterial outbreaks associated with noncommunity systems, with S.
sonnei identified in 20 (87.0%) of these outbreaks. In six outbreaks (14.3%), C. jejuni was identified as the sole pathogen.
Salmonella caused five sole-pathogen outbreaks (11.9%), with
S. Javiana, S. Typhimurium, S. Weltev, and S. Typhi each
identified in single outbreaks (one outbreak had no identified
Salmonella serotype). The single outbreak of 210 cases of typhoid fever due to S. Typhi occurred in 1973 at a migrant labor
camp in Dade County, FL, and was associated with a contaminated well (6). E. coli O157:H7 was identified in two solepathogen outbreaks (4.8%), and E. coli O6:H16 was identified
in one outbreak (2.4%). P. shigelloides caused one sole-pathogen outbreak (2.4%). Four (9.5%) outbreaks involving multiple bacteria were identified: E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni; E.
coli O157:H7, C. jejuni, and E. coli O145; C. jejuni and P.
shigelloides; and C. jejuni and Y. enterocolitica.
(iii) Viruses. Of the 33 viral outbreaks in noncommunity
systems, norovirus caused 24 outbreaks (72.7%) and hepatitis
A virus caused 9 outbreaks (27.3%).

(iv) Chemicals. Fluoride caused 50.0% (n ⫽ 5) of the 10
outbreaks associated with chemical contamination in noncommunity systems. Other agents associated with chemical outbreaks include copper (n ⫽ 2, 20.0%), arsenic (n ⫽ 1, 10.0%),
and oil (n ⫽ 1, 10.0%). One outbreak (10.0%) involving multiple chemicals was associated with both copper and other
minerals.
Locations. The majority of community outbreaks (n ⫽ 231,
68.3%) occurred in residential settings (e.g., community municipalities, apartments, subdivisions, mobile homes, and private residences). Other community outbreak locations included hospitals and nursing homes (n ⫽ 19, 5.6%); hotels,
motels, lodges, and resorts (n ⫽ 18, 5.3%); restaurants and
cafeterias (n ⫽ 16, n ⫽ 4.7%); and school, college, and university settings (n ⫽ 16, 4.7%). Other locations (n ⫽ 38) accounted for the remaining 11.2% of community outbreaks.
Most noncommunity outbreaks occurred in camps or recreational settings, e.g., camps, cabins, parks, and recreational
areas (n ⫽ 151, 44.2%). Other noncommunity outbreak locations included hotels, motels, lodges, and resorts (n ⫽ 62,
18.1%); restaurants and cafeterias (n ⫽ 59, 17.3%); school,
college, and university settings (n ⫽ 20, 5.8%); and other
locations (n ⫽ 50, 14.6%).
Water system deficiencies. In the 338 WBDOs associated
with community water systems, investigators reported 323 deficiencies in 320 (94.7%) of these WBDOs. In the remaining 18
community water system WBDOs (5.3%), no deficiencies were
reported; consequently, these outbreaks were categorized as
having unknown deficiencies. The 341 deficiencies for the 338
WBDOs included the 18 WBDOs categorized as having unknown deficiencies. Of the 341 deficiencies, 103 (30.2%) were
due to the use of contaminated, untreated surface water (n ⫽
3, 0.9%) or to deficiencies in treatment of contaminated surface water (n ⫽ 100, 29.3%). The next most common category
of deficiencies (n ⫽ 88, 25.8%) involved the use of contaminated untreated groundwater (n ⫽ 34, 10.0%) or deficiencies
in treatment of contaminated groundwater (n ⫽ 54, 15.8%).
Additionally, a substantial percentage of the outbreaks in community systems were due to premise plumbing deficiencies
(n ⫽ 55, 16.1%) and contamination of the distribution system
(n ⫽ 49, 14.4%). Not included among the premise plumbing
outbreaks were 20 outbreaks associated with Legionella
(5.9%); all were reported in community systems during 2001 to
2006. Of the remaining deficiencies, 18 (5.3%) were unknown,
four (1.2%) involved treatment deficiencies in mixed groundwater and surface water systems, three (0.9%) involved pointof-use contamination, and one (0.3%) involved the use of a
treatment method not expected to remove a chemical contaminant in a groundwater system.
In the 342 WBDOs associated with noncommunity water
systems, investigators reported 343 deficiencies in 331 (96.8%)
of these WBDOs. In the remaining 11 noncommunity water
system WBDOs (3.2%), no deficiencies were reported; consequently, these outbreaks were categorized as having unknown
deficiencies. The 354 deficiencies for the 342 WBDOs included
the 11 WBDOs categorized as having unknown deficiencies.
The majority (n ⫽ 261, 73.7%) of the 354 deficiencies in noncommunity systems were due to the use of contaminated untreated groundwater (n ⫽ 145, 41.0%) or to deficiencies in
treatment of contaminated groundwater (n ⫽ 116, 32.8%). The

CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV.

next most common category of deficiencies (n ⫽ 40, 11.3%)
involved the use of contaminated untreated surface water (n ⫽
13, 3.7%) or deficiencies in treatment of contaminated surface
water (n ⫽ 27, 7.6%). WBDOs in noncommunity systems were
also caused by water distribution system contamination (n ⫽
25, 7.1%) and premise plumbing deficiencies (n ⫽ 8, 2.3%).
Not included among the premise plumbing outbreaks were
four outbreaks (1.1%) associated with Legionella; all were reported in noncommunity systems during 2001 to 2006. Of the
remaining deficiencies, 11 (3.1%) were unknown, 4 (1.1%)
involved point-of-use contamination, and 1 (0.3%) involved a
treatment deficiency in a mixed groundwater and surface water
system.
Water System Deficiency Trends: Outbreaks
in Public Water Systems
Although both the number of reported outbreaks and the
number of associated deficiencies decreased during 1971 to
2006, the annual proportions of the different types of water
system deficiencies showed various patterns. Because these
patterns have public health implications, trends in the annual
proportions of deficiencies were evaluated; these trends in
deficiencies are summarized in Fig. 6 in 12-year periods. The
trend analyses involving water system deficiencies exclude legionellosis outbreaks from both the numerators and denominators. However, outbreaks with unknown deficiencies are included because this category is an important indicator of
surveillance functionality (investigation, ascertainment, and reporting) and because the proportion of unknown deficiencies
also varies over time, affecting the proportions of the other
categories of deficiencies.
Untreated drinking water. During the 36-year period, a
trend analysis found a statistically significant decrease in the
annual proportion of reported deficiencies in public water
systems associated with contaminated, untreated surface
water (P ⫽ 0.0179). In contrast, there was no statistically significant change in the annual proportion of reported deficiencies
in public water system outbreaks (either in community or noncommunity systems) associated with contaminated, untreated
groundwater.
Water treatment deficiencies. During the 36-year period, a
trend analysis found a statistically significant decrease in the
annual proportion of reported deficiencies that were associated with the inadequate or interrupted treatment of water by
public water systems (P ⫽ 0.0495). This decrease in water
treatment deficiencies was observed in community systems
(P ⫽ 0.0177) but not in noncommunity systems.
Further evaluation showed differences in the importance of
water treatment in WBDOs by type of water source (Fig. 7).
The annual proportion of treatment deficiencies involving surface water in public systems decreased over time (P ⫽ 0.0043).
These deficiencies included inadequate disinfection of unfiltered surface water (e.g., contamination overwhelmed the
chlorine dosage), interrupted disinfection (e.g., breakdown in
equipment), inadequate filtration and/or pretreatment, and
inadequate control of the addition of chemicals other than
disinfectants (e.g., fluoride or sodium hydroxide). In contrast, no statistically significant change over time was observed in the annual proportion of treatment deficiencies

involving groundwater in public systems. Inadequate or interrupted disinfection was the primary treatment deficiency
for groundwater systems and was identified in 88.4% of the
groundwater outbreaks reported in public systems. Al-

though filtration is not generally required for most groundwaters, a few public water system WBDOs (3.4%) were also
attributed to inadequate filtration of groundwater. The remaining groundwater outbreaks (8.2%) in public systems

were caused either by a malfunction of equipment for the
addition of chemicals other than a disinfectant or by an
unspecified treatment deficiency.
Untreated and inadequately treated water. When deficiencies of untreated and improperly treated source water in public
water system outbreaks were considered together (Fig. 7), the
annual proportion of deficiencies associated with untreated and
improperly treated surface water decreased over the 36-year period (P ⫽ 0.0004). However, the annual proportion of deficiencies
associated with untreated and improperly treated groundwater
did not change over time.
To explore the changing trends more closely, the 36-year
surveillance period was divided in half and the trends in deficiencies associated with public water systems during each 18year period were reexamined. No changes in the annual
proportion of deficiencies associated with untreated and improperly treated source water (either surface water or groundwater) were observed during 1971 to 1988. Similarly, no change
in the annual proportion of deficiencies associated with untreated and improperly treated groundwater were observed
during 1989 to 2006, but a decrease in the annual proportion of
those deficiencies associated with surface water was seen after
1989 (P ⫽ 0.0077).
Distribution system and premise plumbing deficiencies.
There was no statistically significant change in the annual proportion of distribution system deficiencies in public water systems during 1971 to 2006 in either community or noncommunity water system outbreaks. In contrast, there was an increase
in the annual proportion of premise plumbing deficiencies
(excluding legionellosis outbreaks) in public water systems during this time period (P ⫽ 0.0024) (Fig. 6).
Deficiencies under the jurisdiction of a public water utility
or regulated by the government. Deficiencies in public water
systems involving untreated source water, treatment, or the
distribution system are under the jurisdiction of a public water
utility or a commercial water supplier (in the case of noncommunity water systems) and are therefore regulated by state and
federal governments. During 1971 to 2006, 572 (83.3%) of the
695 deficiencies identified in public water system outbreaks
met these criteria. Although each of these deficiencies was
analyzed separately as noted previously, a combined analysis
provides an indication of the effectiveness of regulations and
efforts of water utilities to improve drinking water quality. The
annual proportions of these deficiencies, when considered together, decreased over time during the 36-year period (P ⬍
0.0001). In contrast, the annual proportion of deficiencies observed in premise plumbing increased, as described previously.
Point-of-use deficiencies are also outside the jurisdiction of a
water utility. However, trend analysis for these deficiencies was
not possible, because only seven deficiencies were reported
and six of them occurred since 1993.
Unknown deficiencies. During the 36-year period, 29 outbreaks in public water systems (4.2%) had no deficiencies
identified. The annual proportion of these unknown deficiencies increased over time (P ⫽ 0.0135).
Etiology Trends: Outbreaks in Drinking Water
Illnesses. During 1971 to 2000, 630 (90.5%) of the 696 drinking water outbreaks were associated with acute gastrointestinal

CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV.

illness and none with acute respiratory illness. However, during
2001 to 2006, when legionellosis outbreaks were reported, 55
(65.5%) of the 84 drinking water outbreaks were associated
with acute gastrointestinal illness and 24 (28.6%) with acute
respiratory illness. From 1971 to 2000, the annual proportion
of acute gastrointestinal illness outbreaks remained unchanged
over time. In contrast, during 1971 to 2000, the annual proportion of hepatitis outbreaks decreased over time (P ⫽
0.0052); only one hepatitis outbreak was reported during 2001
to 2006. The annual proportion of drinking water outbreaks
with unknown illnesses also decreased over time during 1971 to
2000 (P ⫽ 0.0197); no drinking water outbreaks with unknown
illnesses were reported during 2001 to 2006. Trend analyses for
skin conditions (n ⫽ 5) and neurological conditions (n ⫽ 1)
were not performed because so few outbreaks associated with
these illnesses were reported.
Etiologic agents. The annual proportion of nonlegionellosis
bacterial, chemical, parasitic, and viral outbreaks in drinking
water did not change over the 36-year period. Only the annual
proportion of drinking water outbreaks with unidentified etiologic agents changed, decreasing over time during 1971 to
2000 (P ⫽ 0.0134) and during 2001 to 2006 (P ⫽ 0.0132) with
the inclusion of legionellosis outbreaks.
Etiologic agents by water system type. The proportions of
etiologic agents associated with outbreaks in public water systems are shown collectively for each of the three 12-year periods in Fig. 8; this analysis included legionellosis outbreaks
and illustrates the importance of legionellosis outbreaks during
the most recent period, the only period in which they were
reported. The following trend analyses considered the annual
proportions of etiologic agents by water system type and excluded legionellosis outbreaks from both the numerators and
denominators.
In community water systems, the annual proportion of
chemical outbreaks increased over time (P ⫽ 0.0018). No statistically significant trends were observed for nonlegionellosis
bacterial, parasitic, and viral outbreaks. The annual proportion
of outbreaks with unknown etiologies decreased over time
(P ⫽ 0.0001).
In noncommunity water systems, the annual proportion of
viral outbreaks increased over time (P ⫽ 0.0100). However, no
statistically significant trends were observed for non-Legionella
bacterial, chemical, and parasitic outbreaks. The annual proportion of outbreaks with unknown etiologies decreased over
time (P ⫽ 0.0052).
In individual water systems, the annual proportion of chemical outbreaks decreased (P ⫽ 0.0229) over time. However, no
statistically significant trends were observed for non-Legionella
bacterial, parasitic, or viral outbreaks. In contrast with the overall trend toward more complete identification of etiologic agents
in outbreaks reported in public systems, the proportion of unknown agents in individual systems increased (P ⫽ 0.0081).
Etiologic agents by source water type. Over the 36-year
period, no statistically significant trends in etiologic agents by
source water type were observed among drinking water outbreaks except for those caused by parasitic diseases in the
second half of the surveillance period (1989 to 2006). The
annual proportion of parasitic outbreaks in drinking water
associated with either groundwater or surface water did not
change during 1971 to 1988. However, the annual proportion

2001 to 2006.

of parasitic outbreaks associated with groundwater increased
(P ⫽ 0.0271) during 1989 to 2006, while the annual proportion
of parasitic outbreaks associated with surface water decreased
(P ⫽ 0.0060). Similar patterns were seen when only parasitic
outbreaks associated with public water systems (community
and noncommunity) were considered, although the decrease in
the annual proportion of outbreaks associated with surface
water after 1989 was borderline statistically significant (P ⫽
0.0560). These trend analyses excluded legionellosis outbreaks
from both the numerators and denominators.
Outbreaks Associated with Legionella in Drinking Water
During 2001 to 2006, Legionella was responsible for 24
(28.6%) of the 84 drinking water outbreaks, 126 (2.8%) of the
4,460 drinking water-related cases, and 12 (80.0%) of the 15
drinking water-related deaths. All outbreaks of acute respiratory illness (1971 to 2006) were caused by Legionella. Most of
the legionellosis outbreaks were associated with L. pneumophila (n ⫽ 17, 70.8%). L. micdadei was identified in one outbreak (4.2%) and two cases. L. anisa was a copathogen in one
outbreak (4.2%) with L. pneumophila.

The growth of Legionella in premise plumbing contributed
to 24 (26.7%) of the 90 deficiencies reported in drinking water
WBDOs during 2001 to 2006. Most legionellosis outbreaks
associated with drinking water occurred in hospitals, health
care facilities, and nursing homes (n ⫽ 16, 66.7%). Of these, 14
(87.5%) occurred in community water systems and 2 (12.5%)
in noncommunity water systems. Four outbreaks (16.7%) occurred in hotels, motels, lodges, and inns; half of these were in
community water systems and half in noncommunity water
systems. Three (12.5%) outbreaks occurred in apartments and
condominiums; all were associated with community water systems. The remaining legionellosis outbreak occurred in a gym
with a community water supply.
Outbreaks in Water Not Intended for Drinking
During 1971 to 2006, 47 outbreaks and 861 cases involving
water not intended for drinking were reported, comprising
5.6% of all reported outbreaks and 0.1% of all cases (0.5%
without inclusion of the Milwaukee outbreak in 1993). Twentysix outbreaks (55.3%) and 354 cases (41.1%) associated with
water not intended for drinking were reported during the 13-

year period from 1971 to 1983, and 21 outbreaks (44.7%) and
507 cases (58.9%) were reported during the 11-year period
from 1996 to 2006; there were 12 years in the middle of the
36-year surveillance period during which no outbreaks associated with water not intended for drinking were reported, making trend analysis invalid.
Etiologic agents were identified in 29 (61.7%) of these outbreaks (Table 3). Parasitic and bacterial etiologies were the
most frequently reported causes of these outbreaks, with G.
intestinalis (n ⫽ 9), Legionella (n ⫽ 9), and E. coli O157:H7
(n ⫽ 3) the most frequently identified single etiologic agents.
One outbreak among individuals who had consumed wastewater at a wastewater treatment plant involved mixed agents
(Giardia and an unidentified agent) and caused two cases of
acute gastrointestinal illness. Most of the outbreaks associated
with water not intended for drinking (n ⫽ 36, 76.6%) involved
acute gastrointestinal illness; nine outbreaks (19.1%) involved
acute respiratory illness (all caused by Legionella), one (2.1%)
involved hepatitis, and one (2.1%) involved dermatitis associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All of the 13 deaths associated with these outbreaks were attributed to Legionella.
The outbreaks occurred primarily among hikers, campers,
and other persons who drank untreated water from streams
and lakes (n ⫽ 17, 36.2%). Four outbreaks (8.5%) caused
legionellosis among hospital or nursing home patients exposed
to cooling tower aerosols, four outbreaks (8.5%) occurred in
factories and industrial facilities, and three outbreaks (6.4%)
occurred at wastewater treatment plants as a result of drinking
partially treated or untreated wastewater. The remaining outbreaks occurred in multiple different settings.
Outbreaks in Water of Unknown Intent
Six reported outbreaks and 36 cases involving water not
intended for drinking were reported since 2003. No deaths
were reported. Five (83.3%) of the outbreaks were associated
with legionellosis (Table 3); two occurred at hotels, one at a
nursing home, one at a city garage, and one at an apartment
building. One outbreak (16.7%) that occurred at a sports complex was associated with acute gastrointestinal illness caused by
E. coli O157:H7.
IMPLICATIONS OF OUTBREAK EVALUATION
Analysis of WBDOs reported during the past 36 years reveals several clear trends. The following discussion focuses on
these trends and highlights emergent issues that need renewed
emphasis and further research to help prevent waterborne
disease and outbreaks associated with drinking water.
Decreased Reports of Drinking Water Outbreaks
The number of WBDOs associated with drinking water decreased during the 36-year review period. Possible explanations for this decrease include the impact of national drinking
water regulations, changes in water system management and
practices, and improvements to drinking water infrastructure,
especially water treatment facilities. Also important is the cooperative partnership of public water systems and organizations, including EPA, the American Water Works Association,

CLIN. MICROBIOL. REV.

and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators,
known as the Partnership for Safe Water, with the objective of
improving water plant performance (1). Although a significant
decrease has occurred since peak reporting in 1980, a number
of drinking water outbreaks are still reported each year. Continued cooperation and vigilance by water utility operators,
regulators, and public health officials are required to maintain
improvements in public health protection and ensure the safety
of drinking water for the future. An effective program should
include a focus on water system operation with monitoring of
treatment effectiveness and water quality as well as the implementation of regulations and the periodic evaluation of their
effectiveness.
Decreased Importance of Outbreaks in Public Systems and
Increased Importance of Outbreaks in Individual Systems
A significant decrease in the annual proportion of reported outbreaks in public drinking water systems was observed; however, an increase was observed in the annual
proportion of outbreaks associated with individual water
systems. Although springs, lakes, and ponds may be used as
water sources, privately owned individual systems primarily
use well water. EPA regulations that protect public drinking
water systems do not apply to individual water systems. The
installation of these systems (e.g., location and construction
of the well and any needed water treatment and water quality monitoring) may be regulated by state or local authorities, but the individual owners are usually responsible for
ensuring that their water is safe once the system is in operation. To safeguard the quality of well water, homeowners
should seek information on needed protective measures, including disinfection and other treatment options, and implement the recommended source protection, operation, and
maintenance guidelines. Periodic water quality analyses should
also be conducted. Additional educational activities should
focus on the importance of routine water testing and system
maintenance and should be targeted to well owners, users,
drillers, and local and state drinking water personnel. EPA
recommendations for protecting private wells are available at
http://www.epa.gov/safewater/pwells1.html. CDC information
about private wells is available at http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater
/drinking/private/wells/index.html.
Decreased Importance of Surface Water Outbreaks and
Continued Importance of Groundwater Outbreaks
There was a decrease in the annual proportion of deficiencies associated with untreated and improperly treated surface
water as a cause of outbreaks in public drinking water systems.
During 1986 to 2006, a decreased number of outbreaks in
public systems using surface water were reported as the number of these systems was increasing from 9,527 (38) to 14,544
(43) systems. The decrease in the proportion of deficiencies
associated with untreated or improperly treated surface water
occurred in the second half of the surveillance period (1989 to
2006) after the promulgation of the Surface Water Treatment
Rule (SWTR) in 1989 and subsequent amendments (39, 40,
41). The 1989 SWTR was designed to reduce waterborne risks
from Giardia, Legionella, viruses, and heterotrophic bacteria;



VOL. 23, 2010

CAUSES OF U.S. DRINKING WATER-ASSOCIATED OUTBREAKS

treatment requirements specified for the inactivation/removal
of the more disinfection-resistant Giardia (99.9%) and viruses
(99.99%) ensure that the bacteria are inactivated or removed.
Amendments to the 1989 SWTR provided for more stringent
treatment requirements to further reduce risks, including those
posed by Cryptosporidium. To ensure that conventional and
direct filtration systems provide for a 99% removal of Cryptosporidium, treatment requirements include the disinfection of
all surface water sources and the filtration of surface water
sources, except for those that meet strict requirements regarding watershed activities and raw water quality, and more stringent turbidity standards and monitoring requirements. The last
outbreak in a public system that used unfiltered, disinfected
surface water was reported in 1997. Giardia was the cause of
the outbreak.
The annual proportion of deficiencies associated with untreated and improperly treated groundwater, however, did not
change over time. The number of reported outbreaks in public
systems using contaminated groundwater decreased slightly
during 1986 to 2006, but the number of these systems also
decreased, from 182,749 (38) to 142,100 (43). This suggests
that improvements and interventions with groundwater systems were not as successful as those with surface water systems
and that greater attention is needed to address and reduce the
risk for outbreaks in groundwater systems. These outbreaks
are a reminder not only of the potential for contamination of
wells and springs but also that treatment, if provided, should be
adequate to cope with source water contamination and should
be operated without interruption.
Groundwater contamination can have a broad public health
impact. Approximately 45% of the U.S. population is supplied
by groundwater, through either public or individual water systems (19, 43). Outbreaks have occurred when improperly protected groundwater sources have been contaminated by surface water intrusion or sewage discharges and when wells in
limestone, rock, or other unconfined aquifers have become
contaminated. Even properly developed wells in confined aquifers may become contaminated. A recent study of groundwater
aquifers serving public systems in Madison, WI, found the
occurrence of human-pathogenic viruses in well water from a
deep (65-m) confined aquifer. Twenty-three percent of samples were positive for enterovirus, including coxsackievirus and
echovirus (5).
EPA’s Ground Water Rule (42) was promulgated in 2006 to
provide for increased protection against pathogens in public
groundwater systems. Instead of requiring disinfection for all
groundwater systems, the rule establishes a risk-targeted approach to identify those systems that may be most susceptible
to fecal contamination and specifies corrective actions to reduce the risk of waterborne illness. The risk-targeted strategy
includes regular sanitary surveys to identify significant deficiencies and source water monitoring to test for the presence
of indicators of fecal contamination. Measures to protect public health include requirements to correct deficiencies, eliminate the source of contamination, provide an alternative
source of water, or provide treatment that reliably achieves a
reduction of at least 99.99% of viruses. When treatment is
provided, compliance monitoring must be maintained to ensure that 99.99% removal is maintained. Implementation of
the rule began on 1 December 2009, and a reduction in

523

groundwater outbreaks should be seen in the future, analogous
to what was seen after implementation of the SWTR for surface water systems.
Legionella and the Changing Illness Profile
of Drinking Water Outbreaks
An important finding for outbreaks associated with drinking
water is the change in illness profile of reported outbreaks
since the addition of legionellosis outbreaks to the WBDOSS
in 2001. Prior to 2001, acute gastrointestinal illness was the
dominant illness type among reported outbreaks, and no outbreaks associated with acute respiratory illness were reported.
However, from 2001 to 2006, while acute gastrointestinal illness remained the dominant illness type, 24 acute respiratory
illness outbreaks were reported, all associated with Legionella,
comprising 29% of all reported drinking water outbreaks during that 6-year period. Even though these WBDOs have been
included in the surveillance system for only 6 years, Legionella
(n ⫽ 38 outbreaks) is the third most common etiologic agent
among all of the outbreaks associated with drinking water,
water not intended for drinking, and water of unknown intent
reported during the entire 36-period, surpassed only by Giardia (n ⫽ 135) and Shigella (n ⫽ 45). These outbreaks were all
caused by the amplification and dissemination of Legionella
through premise plumbing, pipes, and storage infrastructure
not normally under the jurisdiction of a public water utility.
Two-thirds of the legionellosis outbreaks associated with
drinking water occurred in health care settings, demonstrating
the ability of Legionella to colonize the biofilms frequently
found inside the large, complex plumbing systems of hospitals.
These data underscore the importance of maintaining a high
index of suspicion for legionellosis associated with health care
settings.
Legionellosis was first identified in 1976 (13), and outbreaks
of legionellosis occurred prior to 2001 (18, 27, 33). CDC is
currently conducting a review of legionellosis outbreaks that
occurred prior to 2001 and plans to add these outbreaks to
WBDOSS to provide a more complete representation of the
role of Legionella in waterborne outbreaks. The expanded legionellosis outbreak review will likely increase the number of
identified outbreaks and further emphasize the importance of
Legionella as a waterborne pathogen.
The expanded review will also assess outbreak settings and
deficiencies associated with these outbreaks to provide a better
understanding of the location of outbreaks and the survival
and inactivation of Legionella in parts of the water system not
addressed by federal regulations.
Increased Importance of Outbreaks Due to Premise
Plumbing Deficiencies; Distribution System
Outbreaks Remained Constant over Time
The surveillance data indicate an increasing trend in the
annual proportion of reported outbreaks associated with
premise plumbing deficiencies with and without consideration
of legionellosis WBDOs, which have been reported only since
2001 and are associated primarily with premise plumbing. No
such trend is seen for outbreaks associated with distribution
system deficiencies. Premise plumbing deficiencies occur out-



524

CRAUN ET AL.

side the jurisdiction of a water utility at points not federally
regulated and include plumbing deficiencies (e.g., cross-connections), deficiencies in building-specific water treatment, and
deficiencies in or contamination of equipment using or distributing water (e.g., drink mix machines) in addition to Legionella.
Point-of-use deficiencies are not included with premise plumbing deficiencies but comprise 1.5% of all drinking water deficiencies. Although the total number of outbreaks and their
associated deficiencies has declined since 1980, the shifting
epidemiology among reported WBDOs toward outbreaks associated with deficiencies occurring after the water meter or
property line, including deficiencies inside buildings, highlights
the need to focus greater attention on premise plumbing and
point-of-use issues.
Among public water system WBDOs, the annual proportion
of deficiencies associated with the distribution system has not
significantly changed during the 36-year period. Previous reviews (10, 11) indicated a greater influence of distribution
systems deficiencies, particularly in more recent years of
WBDOSS reporting. The newly reclassified categories of deficiencies implemented in 2003 and expanded to the entire
36-year period for this review (23, 47) have allowed for separation of deficiencies under the jurisdiction of federal regulations and water utility management. This analysis has elucidated more clearly the growing role of Legionella and premise
plumbing deficiencies in reported drinking water outbreaks.
These distinctions will help inform regulatory processes and
have important implications for future research and prevention efforts. Although distribution system deficiencies that are
under the jurisdiction of federal regulations and water utility
management represent a relatively small proportion of all deficiencies in drinking water outbreaks (i.e., approximately 10%
overall and ranging from 0% to 31% in any given year), their
continuing presence suggests that additional efforts are needed
to reduce this risk. Recent epidemiologic studies in Sweden
and Norway suggest that distribution system contamination
can be a source of endemic illness and that factors contributing
to contamination include leaking water mains and low water
pressure (30, 31). LeChevallier et al. (21) demonstrated the
occurrence of transient low-pressure events in distribution systems and cautioned that during these events, contaminants
may enter the water system through pipeline leaks. The EPA’s
recent Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment (44) found that transmission and distribution system
projects represent the largest category of infrastructure need
by public drinking water utilities. Revisions to the Total Coliform Rule (TCR) should improve distribution system operations and monitoring to reduce health risks. In addition, the
research agenda established through the Research and Information Collection Partnership (RICP) should develop a better
understanding of seven priority distribution system issues identified during the TCR Federal Advisory Committee in 2008 to
2009: cross connections and backflow, storage facilities, mains
construction and repair, pressure and intrusion, biofilm, nitrification, and contaminant accumulation (45).
Locations of Outbreaks: Recreational and Residential Foci
The primary outbreak locations in noncommunity systems
are different from those locations common among community

and individual systems and suggest that both recreational areas
and residential settings need increased attention to prevent
waterborne disease. Nearly half of noncommunity outbreaks
occurred in camps, cabins, or other recreational areas, underscoring the importance of regular monitoring and water testing
in these types of settings, which tend to be seasonal and have
intermittent water use. Other important locations for noncommunity outbreaks included restaurants and cafeterias; hotels;
and educational settings, including schools, colleges, and universities.
More than two-thirds of outbreaks in community systems
during 1971 to 2006 occurred in residential settings (e.g., apartments, condominiums, and private residences), emphasizing
the need for continued vigilance to protect community water
supplies, the importance of multiagency and stakeholder coordination, and the need for rapid and effective communication of boil-water advisories to residents and the community
when public water system breaches occur in residential areas.
Health care settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes, were
the second most common outbreak location in community
systems, highlighting the need for continued vigilance to ensure provision of safe water to locations that serve populations
that are more vulnerable, such as hospitalized patients or nursing home residents with preexisting medical conditions.
Seventy-one percent of outbreaks in individual systems occurred in private residences, suggesting that greater outreach,
awareness, and assistance are needed to help protect water
quality in private wells.
Sporadic Outbreaks Associated with Water Not Intended for
Drinking and Water of Unknown Intent
Relatively few outbreaks associated with water not intended
for drinking and water of unknown intent were reported during
the 36-year period, and their sporadic reports offer no information about trends. A review of the most recent outbreaks
(47) noted the continued occurrence of outbreaks of legionellosis in health care settings associated with aerosols from cooling towers and outbreaks associated with consumption of water
not intended for drinking during camping and backcountry
travel (i.e., travel in wilderness environments) in the United
States.
Surveillance Data Quality Issues
The quality of the surveillance data is variable and needs improvement for better consistency across data fields and individual
outbreaks. Some positive data quality indicators include the decreasing annual proportion of outbreaks associated with unknown
etiologies; this might be a function of newly developed and improved laboratory diagnostic tools to identify etiologic agents in
clinical specimens and in water samples (e.g., detection of norovirus), resulting in more frequent identification of etiologic agents
in recent years. The proportion of illnesses labeled as unknown
has also decreased; improved epidemiologic investigation is one
possible explanation for this trend.
Data quality indicators of concern include the consistency in
the mean number of cases per outbreak per year among outbreaks associated with drinking water. The average size of
reported outbreaks has not changed over time, suggesting that

TABLE 6. Recommendations to prevent waterborne disease and improve surveillance
Recommendation

Continued focus on water system operations, management, water quality, and effective regulations to sustain gains made in the provision of
safe drinking water
Greater attention to address and prevent waterborne disease transmission in unregulated drinking water systems
Greater attention to address and reduce the risk for outbreaks in groundwater systems
Improved understanding of the biology, ecology, and inactivation of Legionella in biofilm and premise plumbing
Improved recognition and focus on premise plumbing and point-of-use issues
Additional efforts to reduce the risk of outbreaks associated with drinking water distribution systems
Improved prevention efforts in residential and recreational settings (e.g., campgrounds and parks) to reduce waterborne disease outbreaks
Research to better characterize the burden of waterborne disease in the United States so that prevention actions can be prioritized and
interventions to reduce waterborne disease can be developed
Additional resources for outbreak detection and investigation of waterborne disease and outbreaks—including epidemiologic, environmental,
and laboratory support—at local, state, territorial, and national levels

detection of smaller outbreaks, which are presumably more
common than larger outbreaks, might not be improving. Furthermore, the proportion of outbreaks with unknown deficiencies and the mean class designation for strength of evidence
(with class 1 indicating strong epidemiologic, clinical, and environmental evidence implicating water and class 4 indicating
less comprehensive evidence [47]) (Table 1) have increased
over time. This suggests a trend toward less complete information, particularly environmental information, and lower
strength of evidence for outbreaks over time. This decrease in
environmental investigation data might be related to decreasing local health department regulation, licensing, or inspection
of public and private water systems during the last 2 decades
(28, 29), potentially leading to decreased ability to investigate
waterborne disease outbreaks. These trends indicate the need
for improved surveillance and investigation, in particular for
local health departments to maintain the capacity for appropriate environmental and risk factor investigation to
identify the antecedent causes of outbreaks. Such investigations will provide information to help public health practitioners, regulatory agencies, and water utilities improve
management practices, develop appropriate policy and regulation, and implement interventions and preventive measures to reduce the incidence of waterborne disease. A first
step toward improving surveillance data quality is to provide
greater emphasis on and more resources for outbreak detection and investigation, particularly environmental investigation, at local, state, territorial, and national levels. It is
important to remember that the information available in
WBDOSS has been voluntarily provided to CDC and EPA
by state, local, and territorial health departments. Not all
outbreaks have been recognized, investigated, or reported,
and reliable estimates of the number of unrecognized
WBDOs are not available. Additional recommendations for
improving monitoring, detection, and prevention of waterborne disease in the United States are listed in Table 6.
CONCLUSIONS
In this review, we characterize the causes of WBDOs, focusing on changes that have occurred during the past 36 years in
the etiologic agents, risk factors, and major deficiencies identified during WBDO investigations. The outbreak surveillance
data captured by WBDOSS do not include reports of endemic
or nonoutbreak waterborne disease. Thus, the statistics in this

report represent only a portion of the burden of illness associated with contaminated drinking water and thereby limit the
interpretations that can be made in terms of illness burden.
Also, the epidemiologic trends and water quality concerns observed in outbreaks might not necessarily reflect or correspond
with trends associated with endemic waterborne illness. The
annual number of endemic acute gastrointestinal illness cases
associated with consumption of public drinking water in the
United States has been estimated to range from 4.3 to 11.7
million cases (7) and from 5.5 to 32.8 million cases (26). These
estimates, however, describe only a portion of the annual incidence of endemic waterborne disease cases; they do not
include the number of cases of waterborne disease other than
acute gastrointestinal illness or the number of cases associated
with nonpublic drinking water systems, commercially bottled
water, water not intended for drinking, water of unknown
intent, and recreational water. The two estimates have wide
confidence intervals, indicating that further research is needed
to characterize national estimates of endemic waterborne disease in the United States.
Developing a comprehensive, pathogen-based waterborne
disease burden estimate is important to help public health
agencies prioritize needs, support programmatic efforts that
focus on waterborne disease surveillance and prevention, and
develop interventions to reduce the burden of waterborne disease in the United States.
Although WBDOSS surveillance statistics do not reflect endemic waterborne illness, analysis of WBDOSS data has identified important trends and contributing factors that cause outbreaks, which in turn has helped shape research, regulations,
and improvements in drinking water quality. In recent years,
these analyses have uncovered new areas of concern (e.g.,
individual systems, premise plumbing, and Legionella). Improvements in the WBDOSS should help lead to more
timely recognition and reporting of WBDOs and identification of water system problems and deficiencies. Maintaining
the WBDOSS is essential to inform and guide prevention
efforts and allocate needed resources at national, state, territorial, and local levels.
