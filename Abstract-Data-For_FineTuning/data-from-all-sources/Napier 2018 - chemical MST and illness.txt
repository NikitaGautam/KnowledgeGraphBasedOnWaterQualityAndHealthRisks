ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic chemicals have been proposed as
potential markers of human fecal contamination in recreational
water. However, to date, there are no published studies
describing their relationships with illness risks. Using a cohort
of swimmers at seven U.S. beaches, we examined potential
associations between the presence of chemical markers of human
fecal pollution and self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) illness,
diarrhea, and respiratory illness. Swimmers were surveyed about
their beach activities, water exposure, and baseline symptoms on
the day of their beach visit, and about any illness experienced
10−12 days later. Risk diﬀerences were estimated using modelbased standardization and adjusted for the swimmer’s age, beach
site, sand contact, rainfall, and water temperature. Sixty-two chemical markers were analyzed from daily water samples at
freshwater and marine beaches. Of those, 20 were found consistently. With the possible exception of bisphenol A and cholesterol,
no chemicals were consistently associated with increased risks of illness. These two chemicals were suggestively associated with
2% and 1% increased risks of GI illness and diarrhea in both freshwater and marine beaches. Additional research using the more
sensitive analytic methods currently available for a wider suite of analytes is needed to support the use of chemical biomarkers to
quantify illness risk and identify fecal pollution sources.

INTRODUCTION
The quality of water used for drinking and recreation is
currently monitored through the enumeration of fecal indicator
bacteria (FIB), which indicate the probable presence of
pathogenic contaminants associated with human and/or animal
waste. Fecal waste is a major cause of poor water quality
resulting in environmental degradation, economic losses,1,2 and
illness risks such as gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, eye, ear,
and skin infections.3−6 In the U.S., Escherichia coli and
enterococci enumerated by culture are the FIB recommended
for detection of fecal contamination in fresh and marine
recreational waters.7 Culture-based methods of measuring these
traditional indicators have two signiﬁcant limitations: (1) the

methods require 24−48 h to complete and (2) the indicators
cannot be used to diﬀerentiate between sources of fecal
contamination.8,9 Importantly, the latter is often necessary for
eﬀective remediation because contamination can arise from
numerous human and nonhuman sources. In recent years,
pollution from nonpoint sources such as surface runoﬀ from
agricultural land use have surpassed that from point sources,
which are subject to discharge permit targets, as the leading

cause of water quality problems.10 Accurate and reliable
methods of identifying pollution sources would not only
provide an indication of types of pathogens that may be
expected and their associated risks, but such information would
also help determine potential remediation strategies.
To address the limitations of traditional culturable FIB, rapid
methods for identifying fecal contamination sources that target
host-speciﬁc microbial or chemical markers have been
developed.11−17 Much of the source-tracking research has
focused on host-speciﬁc gene products of microbial markers
such as members of the genus Bacteroidales or Bif idobacterium
using rapid methods such as real-time or quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).8 Select studies have
focused on viruses, such as coliphages, which may be attractive
source tracking tools because they are important etiological
agents of waterborne disease and are highly host-speciﬁc.8,18
Chemical compounds such as caﬀeine,19−23 pharmaceuticals,23−26 personal care products,19,24 and industrial chemicals19,23 associated with septic, manure, and wastewater
treatment plant eﬄuent as well as fecal sterols and their
derivatives,23,27−30 have also been suggested as anthropogenic
markers in sewage. These compounds provide evidence of a
potential source because they are associated with human
metabolism, activity, or sanitary sewage. Such chemical markers
fall into three broad categories: compounds produced and
excreted by humans (e.g., coprostanol); compounds ingested
almost exclusively by humans (e.g., caﬀeine, carbamazepine);
and those that are discharged into the human waste stream
(e.g., ﬂuorescent whitening agents). As many as 35 compounds
have been shown to be useful as indicators of anthropogenic
pollution in wastewater eﬄuent in the U.S.19 and river and
coastal environments in Japan.24
The diﬀering patterns of fate, transport, survival, and
persistence between human-source chemical markers and
microbial markers means they may be able to be used in
combination as part of a source tracking “toolbox” to yield
greater conﬁdence in source-water quality assessment (i.e.,
multiple lines of supporting evidence), since no single indicator
has been shown to be a perfect predictor of fecal
contamination.16,31 Chemicals have the advantage of low
detection limits, more rapid sample preparation and analysis
times than bacterial culture methods, and can be more
temporally or geographically stable.16,32 Furthermore, chemical
markers do not have the problem of regrowth in the
environment, as do bacteria.33 However, they may degrade32,34
or persist for some distance downstream of their source,16 and
require expensive analytical equipment operated by trained
personnel.19 The relationship between chemicals (as an
indicator of human-derived fecal pollution) and illnesses caused
by waterborne human fecal pollution (e.g., gastroenteritis) is
unknown. This lack of understanding limits the utility of
chemicals as a potential fecal source marker.
Thus, to determine if there is a link between chemical
markers of fecal contamination and negative health impacts
associated with exposure to waterborne pathogens, we used
data from a large, multisite cohort study. Our primary
objectives were to (1) estimate the association between
chemical markers of human-derived fecal pollution and selfreported illness among recreational swimmers, and (2)
determine whether chemical markers were able to identify
human source when used in combination with conventional
fecal indicator Enterococcus spp. that were detected by qPCR.
The investigation of an association between chemical source

tracking markers and incidence of illness is an important step in
the evaluation of these chemicals to serve as indicators of
human fecal contamination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Site Information. This study used data
gathered from the National Epidemiological and Environmental
Assessment of Recreational Water (NEEAR) study,35,36 a
prospective cohort study that examined associations between
recreational water quality and swimming associated illnesses in
visitors to freshwater and marine beaches impacted by sewage.
Participants were enrolled at four freshwater beaches:
Huntington Beach on Lake Erie near Cleveland, Ohio
(2003); West Beach on Lake Michigan at Indiana Dunes
National Seashore in Portage, Indiana (2003); Silver Beach on
Lake Michigan near St. Joseph, Michigan (2004); and
Washington Park Beach on Lake Michigan in Michigan City,
Indiana (2004); and three temperate marine beaches: Edgewater Beach near Biloxi, Mississippi (2005); Fairhope Beach in
Fairhope, Alabama (2007); and Goddard State Park Beach near
Warwick, Rhode Island (2007) (Figure 1). Criteria for beach

selection included being within 7 miles or less of treated sewage
discharge outfalls believed to be a source of fecal pollution at
the beach, variability in water quality based on historical
records, a swimming season at least 90 days long, and several
other factors.35−37 Due to resource and personnel constraints,
all sites could not be sampled during the same year; however,
data from all sites were designed to be combined since they
were all located near treated sewage discharges.
Data Collection. Data collection methods have been
described previously.35−37 Brieﬂy, all beachgoers were evaluated
on weekends and holidays between May and September
(2003−2007). An adult from each household provided
information about demographics, beach activities, water
exposure (extent, time, duration, and location), presence of

had two transects parallel to the beach, one at waist-depth (1
m) and one at shin depth (0.3 m). Each transect had three
sampling points that were sampled three times per day (8:00
AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM). In 2003, samples were collected
at the three waist-depth sampling points only. In the other
years, the two waist-depth and two shin-depth samples closest
to the wastewater discharge were sampled. In all years, only the
11:00 AM sample was collected for chemical analysis. At each
sampling point, two one-liter bottles of water were collected,
one for each analytical method. Samples were collected by
opening and ﬁlling bottles 6−12″ below the surface of the
water. Collection personnel were restricted from wearing
sunscreen, insect repellant, and other personal care products
to minimize contamination of the samples being collected (i.e.,
prevent false positives in the corresponding analytical results).
Additional quality control samples were collected on alternate
weekends. For each method, two extra bottles were collected.
One was analyzed as a sample duplicate, the other as a
laboratory fortiﬁed matrix sample (i.e., matrix spike42,43 (for
details see SI)). Immediately following collection, all samples
were packed in coolers with wet ice during transport to
maintain an internal temperature of ≤4 °C until the following
day, when they were repacked on fresh wet ice and shipped to
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality
Laboratory in Lakewood, Colorado for sample extraction and
chemical analysis.
Chemical analysis has been previously described.19 Brieﬂy,
diﬀerent analytical methods were used because of the diﬀerent
physiochemical properties of the chemical compounds. For
wastewater compounds, including some pharmaceutical compounds, a ﬁltered-water sample was extracted using continuous
liquid−liquid extraction or solid phase extraction and then
analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Method 1433).43 Most other human health pharmaceutical
compounds were extracted by ﬁrst passing 500−1000 mL
ﬁltered water through solid-phase extraction cartridges, then
eluent was concentrated, and the ﬁnal extract was analyzed
using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Method
2080) positive-ion electrospray.42,44 Concentrations were
reported in μg/L (Table S2).
Enterococcus spp. Assessment and Analysis. Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR (reported as calibrator cell
equivalents (CCE)/100 mL) was enumerated following water
sample collection at 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 3:00 PM and
subsequent membrane ﬁltration according to previously
published protocols (U.S. EPA Method 161145−47). Analysis
was performed at EMSL Analytical, Inc. Laboratory (Westmont, NJ) (data available upon request).35,36
Statistical Analyses. The primary exposure of interest was
the presence/absence of each of 20 chemicals that function as
markers of human presence in water samples. The markers
were dichotomized due to a high proportion of sample
concentrations below the detection limit (Table 1) by giving
it a value of “1” if detected in all samples per day, and "0"
otherwise. Alternative classiﬁcations of this primary exposure
were explored in sensitivity analyses.
As a secondary exposure of interest, we grouped all 62
chemicals into ﬁve broad categories: pharmaceuticals, fecal
sterols/stanols, household waste products, industrial waste
products, and chemical contaminants in surface runoﬀ such as
persistent organic pollutants and pesticides (hereafter, runoﬀ).
Prior to grouping, the collinearity of each pairwise combination
of chemical markers was investigated using Spearman rank

underlying acute and chronic health conditions, food and drink
consumption, pre-existing illnesses within 3 days of the beach
visit, and contact with animals or sick persons in the past 48 h
for each household member. Ten to twelve days later,
participants were interviewed by telephone about illnesses
experienced since the beach visit. Consistent with previous
reports,35,36,38,39 “GI illness” was deﬁned as any of the
following: diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in a 24-h period);
vomiting; nausea and stomachache; or nausea or stomachache
and missed time from work/regular activities due to illness.
Diarrhea was also assessed as a stand-alone outcome because it
is frequently used as a deﬁnition of gastroenteritis in
population-based surveillance, e.g.,40,41. “Respiratory illness”
was deﬁned as any two of the following: fever, cough, sore
throat, runny nose, or cold symptoms. Respondents who
already completed the study in the previous 28 days, were <18
years old, or did not speak English or Spanish were ineligible.
The study procedures, questionnaires, protocols, and consent
process were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for the original study. For the analyses in this
report, IRB exemption was granted by University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (Study #13-2274).
Swimming Exposure. Because we were interested in
exposure to potential chemical markers from swimming in
fecally contaminated water, the main analysis was restricted to
swimmers who reported “body immersion”, deﬁned as
immersion to the waist or higher (n = 10 723). Nonswimmers
(i.e., those who reported no water contact, n = 7469) and all
participants who reported going in the water but not “body
immersion” (n = 3576) were excluded because they represent a
more heterogeneous level of water exposure. Fewer participants
reported other categories of water exposure (i.e., head
immersion, swallowed water); they were considered in
sensitivity analyses because of sample size concerns. Deﬁnitions
were consistent with previous NEEAR studies.35,36 Participants
ill within the 3 days prior to their beach visit were excluded
from analysis of the illness outcome related to their baseline
symptoms, but were eligible to be included in analyses of other
outcomes.
Water Sample Collection and Analysis. The exposures
of interest were human-associated chemical markers. A total of
62 chemical markers were detected at least once at one of the
beaches (Table S1 of the Supporting Information, SI);
however, not all 62 were detected at each beach. Therefore,
analyses in this paper were focused on the 20 most consistently
detected chemicals (Table 1): (1) ten chemicals detected at all
4 freshwater beaches were included in freshwater analyses
(acetaminophen, β-sitosterol, bisphenol A, caﬀeine, cholesterol,
n,n-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), diethoxyoctylphenol, metolachlor, phenol, and tributyl phosphate); (2) 10 chemicals
most frequently detected at all 3 marine beaches were included
in marine analyses (acetaminophen, anthraquinone, benzophenone, caﬀeine, camphor, cotinine, DEET, methyl salicylate,
phenol, and tributyl phosphate); and (3) 8 of these 20 most
consistently detected chemicals were included in analyses that
combined freshwater and marine beaches (acetaminophen,
caﬀeine, DEET, phenol, tributyl phosphate, β-sitosterol,
bisphenol A, and cholesterol).
Water samples for chemical analysis were collected in
washed, safety coated amber glass bottles at 11:00 AM on
weekends and holidays between May and September at each
beach in the year participants were enrolled. The NEEAR study

predicted probabilities of the outcome for every value of
observed confounders, and they were combined as a weighted
average separately for both levels of the binary exposure. Thus,
the eﬀect estimates were estimated using predicted probabilities
standardized to the same confounder distribution. A marginal
estimate of the risk diﬀerence comparing chemical marker
exposure to no exposure was calculated by subtracting the
predicted probabilities. We also used stratiﬁcation to assess
modiﬁcation of these marker-illness eﬀect estimates by water
matrix (freshwater vs marine).
Eﬀect measure modiﬁcation of the association between
Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR Method 161145 (CCE/
100 mL) and illness was examined to evaluate whether the
presence of each of the chemical markers strengthened the
association of the general, nonsource-speciﬁc Enterococcus spp.
with illness. In both the primary (chemical marker) and
secondary (chemical category) analyses, Enterococcus spp.
measured by qPCR was treated as the main exposure and the
chemical marker/category was the binary modiﬁer. For
modiﬁcation analyses, chemical categories were dichotomized
with a value of “1” if any chemicals belonging to that category
were detected in all samples per day, and “0” otherwise. The
quantitated values of Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR were

correlations. The value of each category was a count of the
number of chemical compounds belonging to it that were
detected in all samples per day. For example, for a given beach
and day, a value of “2” for the pharmaceutical category meant
that there were two pharmaceutical compounds that were
detected in all samples collected that day.
Factors plausibly associated with poor water quality and
illness were identiﬁed and analyzed using directed acyclic
graphs.48,49 Final models included: age (0−4, 5−11, 12−19,
20−34, ≥ 35), beach site (categorical: Edgewater, Fairhope,
Goddard, Huntington, Silver, West, Washington Park), sand
contact (binary where 1 = digging in or burying body in sand),
17-h rainfall totals (continuous; 3 pm the previous day to 8am
the present day), and water temperature (continuous; only for
analyses with GI illness and diarrhea as outcomes). Robust
standard errors were used to account for dependence of
observations within a household.50
To examine the relation between human-associated chemical
markers and swimming-associated illness, model-based standardization51−54 was performed to estimate standardized
marginal risks, risk diﬀerences (RD), and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (95% CI) using the delta method55 and the total
group as the standard. We used logistic regression to estimate

Beach and 13 out of 18 days (72%) at Washington Park Beach.
Huntington and Edgewater Beaches had the highest frequency
of marker detection, where at least two chemicals were detected
in all samples every day chemicals were measured.
Prevalence of chemical markers. Of the ﬁve chemicals
detected at all seven beaches, DEET, tributyl phosphate, and
caﬀeine were detected most frequently, in 73%, 53%, and 47%
of nonmissing samples respectively (Table 1). The proportion
of samples with left-censored (below limit of detection)
concentrations exceeded 25% for all chemicals, ranging from
a low of 27% for DEET to a high of 82% for acetaminophen.
Average daily concentrations varied widely by type of chemical
and beach (Table 1).
Of the chemicals detected at freshwater beaches, cholesterol
was the only chemical detected in more than 50% of samples;
the remaining chemicals were detected in less than 40% of
samples. The chemicals detected at marine beaches were
detected in less than 35% of samples.
The remaining chemicals were detected infrequently and/or
at low concentrations. We present ﬁndings from analyses of the
chemicals most frequently detected across fresh water and
marine beaches.
Illness Associated with Presence/Absence of HumanAssociated Chemical Markers. In combined analyses of
fresh and marine waters, there were 2 excess cases of GI illness
and diarrhea per 100 swimmers (that is, 2% increased risk) on
days when bisphenol A was present compared to when it was
absent (Figure 2; Table S4). Cholesterol was associated with a
1% increased risk of GI illness and diarrhea, while caﬀeine was
inversely associated with these same outcomes. For respiratory
illness, none of the chemicals investigated were associated with
any excess cases, but bisphenol A, cholesterol, and phenol were
inversely associated.
In analyses of fresh water beaches alone, bisphenol A was
associated with a 2% increased risk of GI illness and diarrhea
(Figure 2; Table S5), while caﬀeine and tributyl phosphate
were associated with 2% increased risks of respiratory illness. In
marine beaches, benzophenone was associated with a 5%
increase in risk of GI and respiratory illnesses and a 3%
increased risk of diarrhea (Figure 2; Table S6). Methyl
salicylate was associated with 5% and 4% increased risks of
GI illness and diarrhea, respectively, and phenol was associated
with 2% and 4% increased risks of GI illness and diarrhea,

dichotomized in two ways according to the Environmental
Protection Agency’s 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria
recommendations:7 above and below a geometric mean of 470
CCE/100 mL (for an estimated illness rate of 36/1000 primary
contact recreators), and above and below a geometric mean of
300 CCE/100 mL (for an estimated illness rate of 32/1000
primary contact recreators). RD modiﬁcation was estimated
with product interactions of Enterococcus spp. measured by
qPCR and chemical markers and then assessed by an
interaction contrast (i.e., diﬀerence of risk diﬀerences) (IC),56
which is zero when the joint eﬀects of two factors are simply
additive.56
To determine if estimates were robust to diﬀerent exposure
categorizations, we examined additional classiﬁcations of
swimming and chemical exposure. First, we repeated our
analyses using two additional deﬁnitions of swimmer: as
participants who reported immersing their head under water,
and participants who reported swallowing water. Second, we
explored a more sensitive binary chemical classiﬁcation where
each chemical was given the value of “1” if it was detected in
one or more samples per day, and "0" otherwise. The data did
not permit classiﬁcations that make use of quantitative values.
All analyses were completed using Stata version 13

Distribution of Human-Associated Chemical Markers
in Recreational Waters. Chemicals Detected by Beach. Up
to 478 chemical samples were collected over 128 weekend days
throughout the course of a summer: 18 days at Edgewater
(2005), Silver (2004), and Washington Park (2004) Beaches;
15 days at Huntington Beach (2003); 19 days at West Beach
(2003); and 20 days at Fairhope and Goddard Beaches (2007).
At least one of the 62 human-associated chemical markers was
found at all beaches. Such chemicals were essentially ubiquitous
on a daily basis (127/128 days), but rarely detected in all of a
day’s samples (26/128 days), and were generally present in low
concentrations.
The lowest frequency of detection of chemical markers
occurred at Silver and Washington Park Beaches. No chemical
markers were detected on 12 out of 18 days (67%) at Silver

beaches.

respectively (Table S6). Caﬀeine, cotinine, and anthraquinone
were the inverse associations of greatest magnitude for all three
outcomes.
Modiﬁcation of Illness-Enterococcus spp. as Measured
by qPCR Association with Presence/Absence of Chemical Markers. Using the illness rate of 36/1000 swimmers,
DEET was a potential modiﬁer. On days when DEET was
present, the diﬀerence in risk of respiratory illness between
swimmers exposed to high vs low Enterococcus spp. measured
by qPCR was negligible (RD = 0.2%; −2.5%, 2.9%); when
DEET was absent, the risk diﬀerence was inverse (RD =
−4.1%; −6.9%, −1.2%). Thus, exposure to DEET modiﬁed the
risk diﬀerence for respiratory illness by 4.3% (IC = 4.3%; 0.4%,
8.2%) (Figure 3; Table S7). None of the other chemicals were
modiﬁers for GI illness or diarrhea. Using an illness rate of 32/
1000 swimmers, tributyl phosphate was a potential modiﬁer of
the risk diﬀerence with Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR
and GI illness (IC = 4.3%; −0.2%, 8.7%) and diarrhea (IC =
3.7%; −0.2%, 7.7%) (Table S8).
Results for modiﬁcation with Enterococcus spp. measured by
qPCR assessed continuously as a daily average concentration
(CCE/100 mL) are shown in Table S9. As shown previously by
Wade et al. (2008, 2010),35,36 we see an increased risk of GI
illness and diarrhea with each 1-log10 increase in daily average
Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR (CCE per 100 mL) (RD
= 1.3% (0.4%, 2.2%) and RD = 1.1% (0.5%, 1.6%),
respectively). However, no individual chemical showed strong
or consistent modiﬁcation of the association between Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR and the outcomes. Interaction
contrast estimates were imprecise, particularly for chemicals
that were infrequently detected (e.g., acetaminophen).
Illness Risk Associated with Categories of HumanAssociated Chemical Markers. Across all beaches, we
observed little evidence to suggest an association between
chemical categories and illness. Exposure to a greater number of
chemicals in a given category did not result in increased risk of
the outcomes studied, suggesting the lack of a dose−response
relationship. Trends were similar when stratiﬁed by freshwater
and marine beaches. In addition, RD estimates for the
association between Enterococcus spp. measured by qPCR and
illness were similar among participants exposed and unexposed
to chemical categories. This was true for Enterococcus spp.
measured by qPCR, whether assessed dichotomously at less
than and greater than 470 CCE/100 mL, or assessed
continuously.
Sensitivity Analyses. Because intensity of water contact
might determine the extent of exposure to human-associated
chemical markers, we also repeated our analysis among those
who had immersed their head in water and among those who
swallowed water. Estimates for both were consistent with what
was found for body immersion swimmers, but less precise
(Tables S10 and S11).
Exploration of a more sensitive categorization of exposure
showed that RD estimates were moderately aﬀected by choice
of dichotomization category (Table S12). Similar to the
primary analysis, most RD estimates crossed the null and had
narrow 95% CIs. Unlike the primary analysis, we observed no
suggestion of positive association between chemical markers
and illness. We did observe several inverse associations. When
acetaminophen was present, it was associated with an overall
1% lower risk of GI illness, diarrhea, and respiratory illness
compared to when it was absent. Similarly, cholesterol, DEET,
phenol, and tributyl phosphate were associated with 1−3%

DISCUSSION
We analyzed possible associations between swimmer exposure
to a select group of anthropogenic chemical markers as
indicators of human fecal contamination and incident
swimming-associated, microbial-caused illnesses, in a wellcharacterized cohort of visitors to U.S. beaches. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the presence of human-associated chemical
markers may be associated with illness, but, with a few
exceptions, we did not observe consistent increased risks across
fresh and marine beaches. Bisphenol A and cholesterol were
associated with increased GI illness and diarrhea in both fresh
water and marine beaches; caﬀeine and tributyl phosphate were
associated with increased respiratory illness in fresh water
beaches; and benzophenone-2, methyl salicylate, and phenol
were associated with increased risk of all three outcomes in
marine beaches. However, several implausible, inverse associations were observed as well, which indicate the positive
associations we observed may also be due to chance alone.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to
investigate the health risks from pathogen exposure associated
with chemical markers of human fecal pollution. This research
question remains an important public health issue, however,
because correlating fecal indicator concentration to health risks
is a key qualiﬁcation for the adoption of any microbe or
chemical as a fecal marker. Despite the gap between the
collection and analysis of data for the NEEAR studies and this
reporting of ﬁndings, there is still a recognized need for
alternative fecal indicators that (1) can be used to distinguish
the sources of fecal pollution to help direct remediation eﬀorts
eﬃciently; (2) whose survival and fate correlate better with viral
pathogens that cause waterborne illness; and (3) can be rapidly
assessed so that beach advisory and closing decisions can be
made in real-time.15,16,19,57,58 While a wide range of chemicals
speciﬁc to human wastewater have been investigated for
potential diﬀerentiation of fecal sources in aquatic environments,12,19,24,26,29,58−60 the relationship of these chemical
compounds to the incidence of illness has not been determined
in the intervening years. In this study, one of the most
promising chemical markers in the literaturecaﬀeinewas
detected at all 7 beaches. Although detected in 47% of samples,
the concentrations detected were low and did not show a
positive association with risk of any measured illness outcome.
Bisphenol A, an industrial wastewater compound used in the
manufacture of polycarbonate resins and a component of paper
receipts, and cholesterol, a plant and animal sterol, showed
suggestive positive associations with enteric illnesses, which are
the illnesses most commonly associated with swimming in
fecally contaminated water.3,35−37,61,62
In our study, several chemical markers showed small inverse
associations with illness, including caﬀeine and cholesterol.
While the magnitudes of the inverse associations were small
(∼2%), the implications of these ﬁndings, if any, are unclear.
Any potential hypotheses are complicated by the fact that
chemical compounds in this study serve as a proxy for human
fecal contaminationeither for human metabolism, human
activity, or sanitary sewage at the beach sites. Because of this,
and the potential for our ﬁndings to be due to random chance,
we were not able to oﬀer hypotheses for the inverse
relationships.

Similarly, the signiﬁcance of the ﬁnding that DEET was a
modiﬁer of the association between binary Enterococcus and
respiratory illness is also unclear; the baseline risk of illness is
null in the presence of DEET, and inverse in the absence of
DEET so while DEET may act as modiﬁer, the risks it modiﬁes
may not be signiﬁcant enough to act on. In addition, given that
modiﬁcation by DEET was not present with continuous
Enterococcus, this ﬁnding may be an artifact of dichotomization,
though the cut-points used coincide with Recreational Water
Quality Criteria levels set by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency for determining fecal contamination that result in
illness.7 It may also be that the recreational swimmers
themselves could have contributed caﬀeine and DEET
contamination to the water even though we took precaution
with the sampling team.
Although there are no epidemiology studies that have
examined the relationship between chemical markers and
incidence of illness, several studies have identiﬁed speciﬁc
chemicals and groups of chemicals that have the greatest
potential to assess human-origin pollution (see refs 16,26 for a
review). Bisphenol A, cholesterol, caﬀeine, DEET, benzophenone, and tributyl phosphate were among 35 chemicals
suggested as potentially useful indicators of human fecal
contamination in an extensive survey of 110 chemicals from
wastewater eﬄuent samples collected in 10 rivers in the U.S.,19
due to being abundant and present in suﬃcient concentration
at the time the NEEAR study was conducted. In fact, chemical
markers investigated in this study included 33 of the 35
compounds suggested as potential indicators by Glassmeyer et
al. 2005.19 The ﬁnding that most chemical markers we
investigated were not associated with illness is not unexpected,
given that chemicals speciﬁc to human waste streams can occur
at low concentrations and are further reduced once wastewater
enters environmental waters through the combined actions of
dilution, hydrolysis, sedimentation, and other factors.16 This
was true in our study, where, although human-associated
chemical markers were detected in at least one sample almost
every day samples were collected, chemical concentrations were
low. For this reason and others, it is unlikely that humanassociated chemical compounds will replace microbial source
tracking markers in determining the source of fecal
contamination using the methods in this paper. In practice,
chemical markers may most likely be used in combination with
microbial source tracking fecal markers or to validate results
obtained using microbial markers, as part of a source-tracking
“toolbox” approach. In such an approach, a suite of source
tracking tools that includes both microbial and chemical
human-associated indicators is more likely to provide
information or an additional line of evidence about sourcespeciﬁcity than any one indicator.15,16,32,33,58 Each indicator has
varying patterns of fate, transport, survival, and persistence that
together may yield greater conﬁdence in an assessment of water
quality source.
Our ability to make inferences was limited by the fact that a
high proportion of chemical samples was left-censored (i.e.,
below the limit of detection) and could not be analyzed
quantitatively. While we did explore quantitative categorizations
of exposure, ultimately the low frequencies of detection
necessitated the decision to dichotomize. This measure then
became a proxy for an individual swimmer’s exposure to
chemical markers. Although these dichotomized daily measures
may not be indicative of actual individual exposure, characterizing individual exposure would have been diﬃcult, costly, and

impractical given the size of the NEEAR cohort. To mitigate
these potential limitations, sensitivity analyses were performed
with exposure dichotomized using a more sensitive deﬁnition,
where a chemical was given the value of “1” if it was detected in
≥1 samples collected/day. The choice of a dichotomization cutpoint moderately aﬀected the estimation of RD estimates by
aﬀecting the proportion of cases with chemical exposure. When
using the more sensitive categorization, the proportion of cases
with chemical exposure increased substantially in some cases, as
for acetaminophen and β-sitosterol. This issue was likely also
exacerbated because chemicals were not present in high levels;
thus, the results may reﬂect residual or unmeasured
confounding.
Ideally the amount of nondetections would have been low
enough to permit us to use quantitative exposure levels. Future
studies should make every eﬀort to use quantitative measures of
chemical exposure, particularly when concentrations are low.
One way to do this is to explore other beach sites in the U.S.
where human fecal pollution is believed to be the dominant
source of water pollution with a broader range of water
qualities. We expect that chemical concentrations below
detection limits may be a common challenge of future studies
because it has been cited as one reason why chemicals might be
best used in combination with microbial indicators as part of a
source tracking toolbox.16 In addition, in studies that compare
the abundance of chemicals upstream of treatment plants, at
treatment plants, and in treated/untreated wastewater eﬄuent
or surface waters, the chemical concentrations follow expected
trends of declining after reaching maximum concentrations in
eﬄuent samples (e.g., refs 19,26). Thus, while the beaches in
our study may not be representative of all freshwater and
marine coastal beaches in the U.S., other U.S. beaches may
share similar challenges.
A second way to address quantitative limitations of this study
is to use similar, but improved methods for water sample
collection and chemical analysis. Analytical methods used in
this study were the ﬁrst generation of “contaminants of
emerging concern” methods developed by USGS, and were
intended for screening purposes. Since then, USGS has reﬁned
these methods; for example Cahill et al., 2004,42 which was
used to determine 22 pharmaceuticals, has been replaced by
Furlong et al. 2014,63 which is used to determine 110
pharmaceuticals with equal or lower reporting levels.
Contemporary analytical methods have greatly expanded
numbers of chemicals analyzed with substantially lower
reporting levels, which should decrease the amount of leftcensored data. Lastly, we acknowledge that the landscape of
chemical markers has evolved and expanded extensively since
this study was conducted. The chemicals available at the time of
our study, which we used for our experimental design, may not
have been best suited to our objectives by today’s standards.
For example, our chemical list did not include artiﬁcial
sweeteners (e.g., sucralose, acesulfame) that are increasingly
attractive as source-tracking markers because they do not
readily degrade in the environment or after wastewater
treatment.64 We suspect that studies conducted using these
newer methods and chemicals would have substantially better
chances of demonstrating the potential for correlation between
chemical markers and microbial beach water quality.
The strengths of this study include the size of the cohort,
inclusion of both freshwater and marine beach sites, and
systematic collection and analysis of over 60 chemical
compounds using then-sensitive quantitative methods. The

study design allowed us to measure water quality over a wide
range of study days and water depths, so we were able to
capture varying water quality conditions over the summer
months. Additionally, the prospective nature of the study
allowed us to determine temporality and the 10−12 day follow
up period reﬂected the incubation time for likely pathogens that
would cause the symptoms of interest. We relied on broadly
deﬁned, self-reported health symptoms as outcomes in an eﬀort
to reﬂect the diversity of symptoms potentially associated with
recreational water exposure, especially since most are selflimiting and infrequently result in doctor’s visits. While it is
possible that our outcomes may also have been aﬀected by
recall bias, it is unlikely that recall would be diﬀerential by
varying levels of water quality or chemical exposure.
Overall, the presence of human associated chemical markers
in recreational waters may be associated with GI illness among
swimmers, but with the exception of two markers, we did not
observe consistent associations across fresh and marine
beaches. In addition, no markers plausibly modiﬁed associations
with illness compared to general, nonsource speciﬁc Enterococcus indicators already in use at beach sites. Our ﬁndings
may have been inﬂuenced by low/no abundance of chemical
markers and were limited to the target chemicals and analytic
tools used at the time of the study. Human-associated markers
may also better characterize risk at sites without a known
impact from sewage, sites impacted by runoﬀ, or a broader
range of fecal contamination. Additional research is needed to
support the use of chemical biomarkers to identify sources
contributing to fecal pollution of recreational water.
