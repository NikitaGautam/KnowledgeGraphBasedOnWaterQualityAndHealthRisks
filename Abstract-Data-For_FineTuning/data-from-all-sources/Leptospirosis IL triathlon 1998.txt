We investigated an outbreak of leptospirosis among athletes and community residents after a triathlon was
held in Springfield, Illinois. A telephone survey was conducted to collect clinical information and data on
possible risk factors, community surveillance was established, and animal specimens and lake water samples
were collected to determine the source of the leptospiral contamination. A total of 834 of 876 triathletes were
contacted; 98 (12%) reported being ill. Serum samples obtained from 474 athletes were tested; 52 of these
samples (11%) tested positive for leptospirosis. Fourteen (6%) of 248 symptomatic community residents tested
positive for leptospirosis. Heavy rains that preceded the triathlon are likely to have increased leptospiral
contamination of Lake Springfield. Among athletes, ingestion of 1 or more swallows of lake water was a
predominant risk factor for illness. This is the largest outbreak of leptospirosis that has been reported in the
United States. Health care providers and occupational and recreational users of bodies of freshwater in the
United States should be aware of the risk of contracting leptospirosis, particularly after heavy rains.
In mid-July 1998, public health authorities from the
Wisconsin Department of Health (WDOH) were notified of 3 Wisconsin athletes who had been hospitalized
with an acute febrile illness. The 3 athletes had participated in a triathlon (competitive swimming, cycling,
and running events) held in Springfield, Illinois, on 21
June 1998. All 3 athletes presented with headache, myalgias, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hematuria. Two

had thrombocytopenia, and 1 had laboratory evidence
of acute renal failure. Because of leptospirosis awareness
among WDOH authorities, serum samples were obtained from 2 of the 3 hospitalized patients and were
immediately tested for leptospirosis at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta). One
serum sample tested positive for leptospirosis by ELISA
[1, 2]. After test results were obtained, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the CDC issued a media
advisory to alert the 876 triathlon participants and their
health care providers of a possible leptospirosis outbreak. In addition, the Springfield Department of Public Health (SDPH) posted health advisories to discourage recreational use of Lake Springfield.
We subsequently conducted a telephone survey to
characterize the illness and to identify its risk factors.

Telephone survey. Contact information for and race times
of the triathlon participants were obtained from the triathlon
organizer. Athletes who resided in 44 US states, Canada, and
Austria were contacted by telephone and were also queried, by
use of a standardized questionnaire, about presence of a flulike
illness, triathlon preparation activities, use of various competition-related products, sources of food and water ingested during the triathlon, quantity of lake water ingested during the
triathlon swimming event, presence of abrasions, and triathlon
participation before or after 21 June 1998. Participants were
encouraged to seek medical care for illness, and arrangements
were made to have their clinical specimens sent to the CDC
for leptospirosis testing.
We defined a “suspected case” of leptospirosis as onset of
fever that occurred from 21 June through 31 July 1998 in a
participant of the Springfield triathlon who had ⭓2 of the
following symptoms or signs: headache, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, red eyes, or eye pain. All serum samples obtained from
triathlon participants were screened by IgM ELISA (PanBio)
[3]; samples with a positive ELISA result (regardless of whether
they were acute- or convalescent-phase samples) underwent a
microagglutination test (MAT) [4, 5]. In addition, serum samples obtained from athletes whose signs and symptoms met the
definition of a suspected case of leptospirosis were also tested
by an MAT, regardless of ELISA screening results. We defined
a “laboratory-confirmed case” of leptospirosis as a suspected
case for which 1 or more positive results were obtained by use
of the following laboratory tests: ELISA, MAT, culture, or immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tissue [6, 7].
Community investigation. Passive surveillance for leptospirosis among community residents involved the collection of
information, by telephone, from residents or from physicians
reporting febrile illness consistent with leptospirosis. Active surveillance involved contacting physicians and infection control
nurses from the emergency departments of all 3 area hospitals
and requesting that persons with possible cases of leptospirosis
be referred to the SDPH. The SDPH personnel administered a
standardized questionnaire to symptomatic residents; serum
specimens that were submitted were screened by ELISA and
then underwent MAT. We defined a “suspected community
case” of leptospirosis as fever that occurred in a resident of
Springfield, Illinois, who had exposure to Lake Springfield in
June or July 1998 and who also had ⭓2 of the following symptoms or signs: headache, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, red eyes, or

eye pain. Residents with a “laboratory-confirmed case” were
defined as residents of Springfield who had lake exposure during June or July 1998 and who received 1 or more positive
results of leptospirosis testing by ELISA, MAT, culture, or IHC
analysis of tissue.
Laboratory methods. All serum samples obtained from
humans were tested at the CDC. IgM antibody that is detectable
by ELISA is usually present within 7–10 days after the onset
of illness [3]; the test result for a sample was positive if ⭓10
PanBio units were detected. The CDC confirmatory MAT test
for samples obtained from humans uses live Leptospira organisms to identify antigen-antibody agglutination across a panel
of 21 different serovars [5]. For humans, a single serum sample
with a titer of ⭓1:400 or a 4-fold increase in the titer measured
in acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples was considered a positive test result.
Blood and urine samples obtained for culture were inoculated in specific media [4, 5] and were held at the CDC for a
minimum of 6 months. Isolates recovered from humans were
then identified by PCR and mapped restriction-site polymorphism analysis performed by the Zoonotic Diseases Research
Unit of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA; Ames,
Iowa). To determine the pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira by PCR, the primers G1/G2 and B64-I/B64-II were used
[8]. For mapped restriction-site polymorphism analysis, target
DNA was amplified using primers 16S–1507/16S-11 [9], which
amplify a portion of the 16S rRNA gene of Leptospira organisms. Amplified products were sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility of Iowa State University in Ames. Consensus sequences for each isolate were compared with the mapped
restriction sites in the 16S rRNA genes for various pathogenic
Leptospira species.
IHC staining of gallbladder tissue was performed by use of
silver staining techniques with a mixture of reference rabbit
polyclonal antisera that were reactive with 16 leptospiral strains
[6, 7]. Leptospiral antigens were seen as intact Leptospira organisms, threadlike filaments, and granular forms [10].
Environmental investigation and animal diagnostic testing. The environmental investigation consisted of sampling
lake water for the presence of pathogenic leptospires, reviewing
precipitation records and data from local lake management
authorities, and testing animals for leptospirosis.
Lake Springfield, a man-made lake of 17.5 billion gallons of
water, was created by the dam on the Sugar Creek; it has a
surface area of ˜4000 acres and 57 miles of shoreline. The lake
is located in the heavily used agricultural area of Illinois and
receives runoff from many local livestock farms. It supplies
water for Springfield and surrounding towns and is used for
public recreation. Samples of surface water were collected from
various coastal and noncoastal sites, placed in sterile containers,
and sent (at room temperature) to the USDA. Water samples



were processed for PCR with probes for pathogenic leptospires
[8]. Water samples were also injected into hamsters; these animals were subsequently killed, and samples of their blood were
collected for culture for leptospira.
Serum samples were obtained from swine, horses, and cattle
residing on farms located in the watershed of Lake Springfield
and from some of the animals (e.g., goats, llamas, zebu, and
donkeys) found in a small zoo located on a stream that feeds
into the lake. When dogs living in the community of Springfield
were seen by veterinarians for any reason, blood samples were
obtained from the dogs. All blood, urine, and tissue samples
obtained from animals, except for those obtained from dogs,
were convenience samples. At the USDA, serum samples from
animals were tested by an MAT using a panel of 6 serovars
(C.A.B., personal communication). An MAT titer ⭓100 was
considered a positive result; however, for animals who had
previously been vaccinated against leptospirosis, these titers
were considered “protective” and were not indicative of active
infection.
In addition to testing samples obtained from domestic and
exotic animals, the USDA (1) performed MAT on serum samples obtained from such trapped wild animals as raccoons,
opossums, muskrats, and deer, and (2) performed fluorescent
antibody-antigen detection assays on tissue samples obtained
from the same types of wild animals. If the animal was killed
or if the sample was obtained from a road-killed animal, kidney
and urine samples were also obtained.
Statistical analysis. Univariate RRs were calculated by use

of the SAS procedure GENMOD (version 6.12, SAS Institute).
The SAS procedure LOGISTIC was used to perform stepwise
unconditional logistic regression. Neither significant interactions nor multicollinearity was found among the variables included in our final multivariable models.
RESULTS
Telephone survey. We interviewed 834 (95%) of 876 participants in the Springfield triathlon; 98 athletes met the definition
for a suspected case (attack rate, 12%) (figure 1). The median
age of patients with a suspected case was 35 years; 98% were
white, and 82% were men. No differences in median age, race,
or sex were found between patients with suspected cases and
athletes who were not ill. For patients with suspected cases and
patients with laboratory-confirmed cases, the median incubation time from lake water exposure to onset of fever was 14
and 15 days, respectively (range, 1–34 days and 6–29 days,
respectively).
Among patients with suspected cases of leptospirosis and
those with laboratory-confirmed cases, the most common
symptoms associated with fever were chills, headache, and
muscle aches (table 1). Seventy-five (77%) of 98 patients with
suspected cases sought medical care, as did 45 (6%) of 736
athletes who were not ill. Twenty-one (40%) of 52 patients
with laboratory-confirmed cases were hospitalized; medical
records were available for 13 of the hospitalized patients. At
admission, all 13 had elevated levels of liver enzymes or bilLeptospirosis Outbreak after a Triathlon • CID 2002:34 (15 June) • 1595

irubin, 11 (85%) had thrombocytopenia, 9 (69%) had proteinuria, 8 (62%) had hematuria, and 4 (31%) had elevated
creatinine values (up to 6.1 mg/dL). In addition, 7 underwent
lumbar puncture, 1 underwent kidney biopsy, and an additional 2 underwent cholecystectomy.
According to univariate analysis, compared with athletes who
were not ill, athletes with suspected cases were more likely to
have had a swim time of 142 min (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0–3.5;
P p .04) and were also more likely to report having ingested
1 or more swallows of lake water during the swimming event
(RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8–7.9; P ! .001). Starting position for the
swimming event, presence of abrasions, having taken a shower
after the race to cool down, and having worn a wet suit or
goggles while swimming were not associated with illness (for
all, P ⭓ .3). According to multivariable analysis, having ingested
“a swallow or more” of lake water was the only variable that
was independently associated with illness (table 2).
Of the 98 athletes who met the definition for a suspected
case of leptospirosis, 32 (33%) submitted 1 serum sample and
53 (54%) submitted 2 serum samples (table 3). Of these 85
athletes, 52 (61%) had signs, symptoms, and test results that
met the definition of a laboratory-confirmed case. The Leptospira serovars grippotyphosa, bratislava, and djasiman consistently had the highest MAT reactivity. Of the 736 athletes who
were not ill, 192 (26%) submitted 1 sample for testing and 197
(27%) submitted 2 samples. Four athletes who were not ill each
submitted 2 samples; although these samples all had positive
results by ELISA, none of the corresponding MAT results were
positive. The 2 patients with suspected cases who underwent
cholecystectomy had positive results on IHC analysis [10].
Community investigation. The SDPH received reports of
293 Springfield residents who met the definition for a suspected
community case of leptospirosis. Of the 248 residents (85%)

1596 • CID 2002:34 (15 June) • Morgan et al.

who had serologic testing performed, 12 (5%) had laboratoryconfirmed leptospirosis (table 3). Reports were also received of
73 individuals whose illness did not meet the definition of a
suspected case and who had serologic testing performed; 2 (3%)
had laboratory-confirmed illness. The median age of the 14
residents with laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis was 15 years
(range, 15–52 years); 13 (93%) were male. Thirteen of 14 residents had infection confirmed by MAT. For 12 of these residents, MAT serovar reactivity was similar to that seen among
the triathlon participants (Leptospira serovars grippotyphosa,
djasiman, and bratislava). Samples obtained from 1 resident
had reactivity to Leptospira serovar canicola only. The 14th case
patient, who had received penicillin intravenously at the time
of the onset of symptoms, had leptospirosis confirmed by culture, and all serologic results were negative.
Residents with laboratory-confirmed cases were more likely
to be male, to seek medical care, to report having “red eyes”
or “eye pain” and “dark urine,” and to be hospitalized for their
illness, compared with all residents who tested negative for
leptospirosis (for all, P ! .05 ). Six of the 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed cases were hospitalized; 2 had documented
Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions after having received penicillin
intravenously.
The Lake Springfield exposure locations were known for 13
of the residents with laboratory-confirmed illness; 11 (85%)
reported having had contact with water near the area where
the triathlon swimming event was held. However, residents’
exposures to water were widely distributed among locations all
over the lake. The predominant water exposures were swimming, jet skiing, and water skiing.
Clinical isolates. Leptospira organisms were isolated from
blood samples obtained from 1 athlete and from 2 residents;
PCR amplification of target DNA revealed Leptospira kirshneri.

Mapped restriction-site polymorphism analysis of the 16S
rRNA gene confirmed that the Leptospira serovar was grippotyphosa. The digestion pattern of the athlete’s isolate was identical to that of the isolate of one resident; the pattern of the
other resident’s isolate showed minor differences.
Environmental investigation. Within 40 days after the
triathlon, lake water samples were collected on 3 different days
from locations around the triathlon swimming event site, from
sites located at the extreme opposite end of the lake, and from
sites located between these points. Of the 27 lake water samples
that were analyzed, only 1 sample, which was obtained from
the shoreline adjacent to the starting point of the triathlon, had
a PCR reaction (G1/G2) that was positive for a pathogenic
Leptospira species; however, no organism was isolated. Two
samples were culture positive; however, both isolated organisms
were saprophytic Leptospira species.
Serum samples were obtained from 205 domestic and exotic
animals (128 cattle, 15 pigs, 29 horses, 8 sheep, 6 dogs, and 19
zoo animals) for MAT analysis. Eighty-four (66%) of 128 cattle
tested and all 15 pigs had previously received a veterinary Leptospira vaccine that contained antigens for the Leptospira serovars grippotyphosa, canicola, icterohaemorrhagiae, pomona,
hardjo, and bratislava. In the vaccinated animals, all titers 11:
100 corresponded to vaccine serovars. Vaccination status was
not available for the dogs; however, only 1 dog had a titer of
1:100 against serovar pomona. None of the horses, sheep, animals from the zoo, or 44 remaining cows had been immunized.
Thirty-three (33%) of these 100 unvaccinated animals had MAT
titers 11:100; Leptospira serovars hardjo, icterohemorrhagiae,
and bratislava had the highest reactivity.
Biologic samples (serum, urine, and tissue) were obtained
from 60 wild animals (raccoons, muskrats, opossums, and
deer); no cultures were positive for Leptospira organisms, and

no serum samples had titers 11:50. Of the 46 tissue samples
examined, 2 kidney tissue specimens (1 from a raccoon and 1
from a deer) were found to be positive for Leptospira organisms
by IHC analysis.
Precipitation records for the Springfield area in 1994–1998
were reviewed. Amounts of precipitation for the periods from
January to June in 1994–1997 were combined, and the mean
precipitation (3 inches) was compared with the mean precipitation for the same months in 1998 (5 inches). May was the
month of peak precipitation in 1994–1997 (mean, 6 inches).
June was the month of peak precipitation in 1998 (10 inches),
with more than double the mean for the months of June in
1994–1997 (4 inches) and 5 times more than that for June 1997
(2 inches). Fecal and total coliform counts for Lake Springfield
(84 and 800 coliforms per 100 mL of lake water, respectively)
were obtained before the 1998 triathlon; these counts were
higher than the average counts obtained during the same time
period in 1997–1994 (65 and 70 coliforms per 100 mL lake
water, respectively). For the month of June 1998, the average
water pH, temperature, and raw turbidity were 8.07, 24.6C,
and 20.3 NTU, respectively, compared with values of 8.11,
23.6C, and 16.3 NTU, respectively, for the months of June in
1994–1997.
DISCUSSION
This investigation documents the largest recognized outbreak
of leptospirosis in the continental United States. Before outbreak awareness was established, none of the ill athletes who
sought medical care was suspected of having leptospirosis. As
a result, many lumbar punctures, 1 kidney biopsy, and 2 cholecystectomies were performed. This not only reflects the lack
of familiarity of US health care providers with the symptoms

and epidemiology of leptospirosis but, also, a lack of familiarity
with the morbidity associated with this infection
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes of
the genus Leptospira [11, 12]. Many wild and domestic animals are reservoirs for Leptospira organisms, and they shed
these organisms in their urine, thereby contaminating freshwater, mud, and soil. Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution; however, it is more common in tropical climates,
where conditions for transmission are favorable [13, 14].
Large epidemics have been recognized in Latin America and
the Caribbean after hurricanes, tropical rainstorms, and
flooding [6, 7, 15–17], and, as in those previously reported
outbreaks, heavy rainfall preceded the outbreak associated
with the triathlon in Springfield reported here. Presumably,
flooding elevates the water table, allowing the soil to be saturated by subsurface leptospires, preventing the evaporation
of contaminated animal urine and fostering the passage and
survival of leptospires in surface waters [18].
In the continental United States, leptospirosis is usually detected in veterinarians and farmers. In addition, small outbreaks
have been documented in individuals who swim in watering
holes, streams, or ponds contaminated with infected urine [19,
20]. By concentrating the leptospires present in water, drought
or dry weather conditions may contribute to outbreaks that
involve small bodies of water. In contrast, Lake Springfield is
a large lake that may have been contaminated by lake runoff
during an unusually rainy season. Despite epidemiologic evidence of widespread leptospiral contamination of the lake, an
animal reservoir with the epidemic strain was not identified.
Assays to determine the presence of pathogenic leptospires
in bodies of water are labor intensive and are of limited use.
Failure to detect pathogenic leptospires in a body of water
provides no valid information about water safety; in addition,
the public health risk of a positive result is not known, because
infection depends on the dose and type of exposure. Thus,
1598 • CID 2002:34 (15 June) • Morgan et al.

screening large bodies of freshwater for leptospires should not
guide public health authorities in making decisions regarding
the safe recreational use of water.
A disrupted skin barrier is the classically acknowledged route
of transmission; however, our survey of athletes found that
ingestion of lake water was the prominent risk factor for illness.
Previous studies have also found that ingestion of leptospirecontaminated water and food was associated with disease [16,
20–23]; in addition, the finding of leptospires in mesenteric
lymph nodes (Dr. Sherif Zaki, personal communication) suggests that the stomach may be an important portal of entry.
The clinical presentation of leptospirosis varies markedly [11]
and may include nonspecific symptoms that are easily mistaken
for such common febrile illnesses as influenza. Unless clinical
suspicion for leptospirosis is high, laboratory diagnosis is rarely
pursued. Serologic confirmation usually requires acute-phase
and convalescent-phase samples, which can be tested by a variety of assays, none of which is readily available in hospital or
clinic laboratories. The gold standard, MAT, is available only
in reference laboratories, is labor intensive and costly, lacks
sensitivity for many species, and requires extensive technical
expertise [4, 5]. In addition, results are not available until long
after treatment decisions have been made.
The results of this investigation call for increased leptospirosis awareness among health care providers and recreational
or occupational users of bodies of freshwater in the continental
United States, especially after heavy rainfalls. Also, with the
increase in “ecotourism,” during which exposure to bodies of
freshwater potentially contaminated with leptospira may frequently occur, the numbers of travelers who return from their
travels with leptospirosis may increase [16, 24]. Empiric therapy
with doxycycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin, or penicillin [11]
should be considered for patients suspected of having leptospirosis after exposure to any outdoor freshwater source. Primary chemoprophylaxis has been shown to be effective [25,

26]; however, few data exist regarding prophylactic treatment
after high-risk exposure [27]. Given that the current methods
of freshwater testing cannot reliably furnish information that
can be translated into effective public health measures, heightened awareness and development of sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive diagnostic assays for leptospirosis are needed.
