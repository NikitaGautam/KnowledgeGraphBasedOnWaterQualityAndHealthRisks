samples or isolates in laboratory studies (proof of concept testing) and/or applied in field
studies where the ‘‘real’’ answer is not known, so their comparative performance and
accuracy cannot be assessed. For source tracking to be quantitative, stability of ratios
between host-specific markers in the environment must be established. In addition,
research is needed on the correlation between host-specific markers and pathogens, and
survival of markers after waste treatments. As a result of the exclusive emphasis on FIB in
legislation, monitoring has concentrated on FIB and lost sight of pathogens. A more
rational approach to regulating water quality would start with available epidemiological
data to identify pathogens of concern in a particular water body, and then use targeted
pathogen monitoring coupled with targeted fecal source tracking to control them. Baseline
monitoring of indicators would become just one tool among many.

Introduction

1.1.

The problem

A large number of water bodies in the US are considered to be
impaired on the basis of their microbiological qualities. To
date, we still manage the microbiological quality of water
using antiquated tools such as indicator organisms. Although
the ultimate source of the microbial pollution is fecal
contamination, most indicator organisms are fully capable
of propagating in water. Furthermore, we continue to equate
exceedence of frequently arbitrarily chosen indicator limits
with imminent human health risk. The results, such as beach
closures and closures of fisheries, have broad economic,
health, and environmental impacts. Recent waterborne disease outbreaks have highlighted the importance of the
problem (Corso et al., 2003; Curriero et al., 2001; Hrudey
et al., 2003; Mac Kenzie et al., 1994; Samadpour et al., 2002).

1.2.

Direct pathogen testing

Since the public health concern is microbial disease, a direct
approach would be to monitor microbial pathogens in water.

However, pathogens may be rare, difficult to culture, and
patchy in distribution, yet highly infectious even at low doses.
Furthermore, to monitor all pathogens, a large number of
assays would be required; these assays can be expensive and
technically complicated. While microarrays and other approaches to simultaneously assay numerous pathogens are
under development (Bodrossey and Sessitsch, 2004; Hamelin
et al., 2006; Lemarchand et al., 2004; Maynard et al., 2005;
Straub and Chandler, 2003; Straub et al., 2005), there are
problems with sensitivity, specificity, and quantification, and
methods are not yet ready for general use.

1.3.

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)

Because of limitations to direct monitoring of pathogens, it is
a standard practice to monitor FIB, such as total and fecal
coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and fecal
enterococci, in water. Epidemiological studies have established human health standards based on exposure to FIB in
drinking, recreational, and shellfish waters (Cheung, 1988;
Holmes, 1989; Pruss, 1998; Wade et al., 2003; Wiedenmann
et al., 2006). Since the most serious threat to human health is



ARTICLE IN PRESS
WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

thought to come from human, not animal, fecal contamination, most studies took place at sites where the principal
source of fecal contamination was human sewage.
However, indicator bacteria do not identify the source of the
contamination. A variety of warm- and cold-blooded animals
contain FIB in their feces (Gordon and Cowling, 2003; Harwood et al., 1999; Souza et al., 1999). Humans and animal
species contain both different numbers and different ratios of
E. coli and enterococci in their feces, although data are
contradictory (Alderisio and DeLuca, 1999; Field, 2004; Fogarty
et al., 2003; Geldreich, 1978; Weaver et al., 2005). This makes it
unclear how to estimate the E. coli or FIB contribution of
different sources of feces when sources are mixed.
An adequate fecal indicator should not reproduce outside
the animal host. E. coli and enterococci survive, grow, and
establish populations in natural environments such as fresh
water lakes and streams (Byappanahalli et al., 2003; Power
et al., 2005), algal wrack (Olapade et al., 2006; Whitman et al.,
2003), beach sand (Byappanahalli et al., 2006b; Whitman et al.,
2005), soils and sediments (Anderson et al., 2005; Byappanahalli and Fujioka, 2004; Byappanahalli et al., 2006a; Fujioka
et al., 1999; Ishii et al., 2006; Solo-Gabriele et al., 2000;
Whitman et al., 2005), and plant cavities (Whitman et al.,
2005). Although the original source of these extra-intestinal
FIB populations is assumed to be fecal, genetic evidence does
not match them with an animal or human source, but instead
supports the evolution of unique environmental strains
(Kinzelman et al., 2004; McLellan, 2004; Power et al., 2005).
An indicator should be correlated with the presence of
pathogens; and it should have a survival profile similar to the
survival profile of the pathogens whose presence it indicates.
E. coli and enterococci are not well correlated with pathogenic
Salmonella spp. (Lemarchand and Lebaron, 2003), Campylobacter spp. (Bonadonna et al., 2002; Horman et al., 2004; Lemarchand and Lebaron, 2003; Lund, 1996), Cryptosporidium and
Giardia spp. (Bonadonna et al., 2002; Harwood et al., 2005;
Horman et al., 2004; Lemarchand and Lebaron, 2003; Lund,
1996), human enteroviruses (Geldenhuys and Pretorius, 1989;
Harwood et al., 2005; Horman et al., 2004; Lemarchand and
Lebaron, 2003; Pusch et al., 2005) including adenoviruses
(Noble and Fuhrman, 2001) and coliphages (Jiang et al., 2001).
The poor correlation of bacterial indicators with viruses is of
particular concern because of the following virus attributes:
low infectious doses, linkage with both acute and chronic
disease, and frequent implication in swimmer-associated
illnesses (Fong and Lipp, 2005).

1.4.
Health risks from human versus non-human fecal
sources
The health threat from human fecal contamination is well
documented. Domestic/agricultural animals also spread
many pathogens; for example, Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7,
Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and
hepatitis E virus (reviewed in Craun et al., 2004). The human
risk from domestic/agricultural animal feces is usually
assumed to be less than from human feces, in part because
viruses, a common cause of illnesses from exposure to feces,
are highly host-specific. Few studies have measured the risk
of animal feces as a source of waterborne zoonotic infections

3519

(Till et al., 2004). In a Hong Kong study, rates of GI tract
illnesses for two marine beaches impacted by animal (pig)
wastes were lower than for seven other beaches, although
rates of skin illnesses were higher (Cheung, 1988; Holmes,
1989). In a New Zealand study carried out at marine beaches,
no substantial differences in illness risks were found between
human and animal (‘‘rural’’, presumably agricultural) waste
impacted beaches, although both were greater than control
beaches (McBride et al., 1998).
The disease risk from fecal contamination of wild animals
is poorly understood, although a number of emerging and reemerging waterborne zoonotic pathogens have been recognized (Bolin et al., 2004). Certain waterborne bacterial and
protozoan pathogens of wild animals infect humans (e.g.,
Leptospira interrogans). Giardia and Cryptosporidium widely
infect wild animals. However, molecular evidence indicates
that most genotypes of these parasites are host-adapted and
cannot cross-infect among different host species (Appelbee
et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2004a, b). In a Connecticut pond with
wild animal but no human fecal contamination, Calderon
et al. (1991) found an increased rate of gastrointestinal illness
in swimmers. FIB rose after rainfall, suggesting fecal inputs.
However, because illnesses were not correlated with FIB or
rainfall, but were strongly correlated with numbers of
swimmers, they concluded that the illnesses were caused by
swimmer-to-swimmer transmission. A recent exposure study
at Mission Bay, California (Colford et al., 2007) found a much
lower level of human illnesses than expected considering the
levels of FIB. In the next year, a follow-up study used two
different methods of microbial source tracking (MST) (ribotyping, Bacteroidales markers) and found that the primary
source of the FIB at Mission Bay was non-human, most likely
from water birds (Samadpour and Field, unpublished data).

2.

Fecal source tracking

Diagnosing the sources of fecal contamination in water has
often been called MST or bacterial source tracking (BST).
However, naturally occurring microbes are ubiquitous in
surface waters, with bacteria occurring at an average density
of 106 cells/ml and viruses at a higher density. In addition,
methods that use chemical indicators or biomarkers to
identify sewage typically do not use the ‘‘MST’’ terminology.
Underlying fecal source tracking is the assumption that
some characteristic in or associated with feces unequivocally
identifies a particular feces type or host source; and that this
identifying trait can be detected in water. Furthermore, many
methods make the (usually untested) assumption that the
relative proportion of identifying traits remains the same over
time after feces enter the water; therefore, if the traits can be
quantitatively detected, the proportional contribution of each
particular type of feces can be estimated.
The field of source tracking has been subject to numerous
reviews (Field, 2004; Meays et al., 2004; Santo Domingo et al.,
2007 (submitted to this issue); Scott et al., 2002; Seurinck et al.,
2005b; Simpson et al., 2002; Sinton et al., 1998; Stoeckel and
Harwood, 2007; USEPA, 2005; Yan and Sadowsky, 2007). But
since many of these reviews were published, there have
been developments in the field. In addition, some reviews



ARTICLE IN PRESS
3520

WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

concentrated only on particular categories of methods (e.g.,
DNA fingerprinting). This review will present a comprehensive review of source tracking with emphasis on the extent to
which methods have been tested (especially in comparison
with other methods and/or with blind samples), the possibility of quantitative source tracking, when methods might be
applicable, their shortcomings, and their usefulness in
predicting public health risk or pathogen occurrence. Finally,
we will discuss the broader question of whether fecal source
tracking and fecal indicator monitoring is the best approach
to regulate water quality and protect human health.

2.1.

Why fecal source tracking?

There may be several reasons for fecal source tracking. The
first concern is frequently to investigate the source of high levels
of FIB. From the point of view of regulators, identifying the
source or sources of FIB (not feces, not pathogens) and
eliminating them may be the only objective. A second
objective may be to identify particular pathogens in water.
Certain sources of fecal pollution might be associated with
particular pathogens (for example, E. coli O157:H7 with
ruminant feces). This is related to the third reason, which is
to estimate the human health risk associated with exposure
to contaminated water. The first objective is largely obtainable using available technology and approaches; the others
may not be.
Even if MST shows that fecal contamination is wholly
animal-derived, current regulations do not usually allow for a
higher permitted level of FIB. Hence the benefits from MST at
present are only that it may allow the source or sources of
fecal contamination to be accurately assigned and located,
and perhaps corrected. In some cases this could lead to a
reduction in FIB. In others, where the source is primarily
wildlife and there is no way to control the wildlife, no
immediate improvement in FIB from fecal source tracking
will be realized.

3.1.

Assessing fecal source tracking

During its development, a new method of fecal source
tracking goes through specific stages of testing (Fig. 1). The
first stage of testing is ‘‘proof of concept’’ testing: the
method’s ability to classify the samples used in its development is tested in the laboratory. The second stage can be
termed ‘‘feasibility and biological likelihood’’ testing: the
method is applied in the field to samples of unknown
composition in an area where a particular source of contamination is thought to occur (e.g., near a sewage outfall, dairy,
or pig farm). If the method can detect its target under field
conditions and concentrations, it is feasible; if it detects the
likely source, this is taken as proof of biological likelihood.
A third stage can be termed ‘‘applicability to novel samples’’
testing. The method may be tested against new samples from
known sources, or tested in new areas (as when the method is
tested by a new group of investigators in a different
geographic region). During this stage of testing, important
parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, and temporal and
spatial variability may be established. The fourth stage is
‘‘comparative’’ testing: the method is formally compared to
other methods and its ability to correctly classify samples is
established. This allows methods to be ranked according to
relative abilities and costs. The fifth stage is testing the
method’s ability to identify blind proficiency samples.

3.
Critical review of fecal source-tracking
methods
Methods for fecal source identification can be divided into
culture-based and culture-independent methods. Furthermore, some methods require a ‘‘library’’, or host origin
database: a set of bacterial isolates or patterns from fecal
samples of known origin, tested using the method of source
discrimination. Most library methods are culture-based, and
require growing environmental isolates from water samples.
Source identification occurs by a comparison between test
patterns or fingerprints from the library and the environmental isolates. Library-dependent methods include both
phenotypic and genotypic tests. Culture-based, library-independent methods are based on growing source-specific virus
or bacteria. Library-independent, culture-independent methods include chemical and molecular tests.
In this review, we use ‘‘host-specific marker’’ to mean any
trait used to identify a fecal source to its host or source
species, including chemical markers, fingerprints, targets for
host-specific PCR, and the like.

fecal source tracking.

The fourth and fifth stages may occur concurrently. The sixth
stage, ‘‘proof of the pudding’’ testing, is application of the
source-tracking method in field studies, followed by measurement of the resulting improvement in water quality.
Few methods of source tracking have gone through all these
stages; many have been published after proof-of-concept
testing only. Some have only been tested to the feasibility and
biological likelihood stage, in field studies where the ‘‘real’’
answer is not known, so their comparative performance and
accuracy cannot be assessed. Few methods have had their
performance ranked against other methods, or tested against
blind samples. Interestingly, some methods have done well in
comparative testing and blind-sample identification and gone
on to widespread use without some of the earlier stages of
testing ever formally occurring.
Often, statistical tests such as the average rate of correct
classification (ARCC or RCC) are applied during proof-ofconcept testing of library-dependent methods. ARCC is a
statistical estimate of the ability of a library to correctly
classify isolates pulled from the library. ARCCs reported in
some studies have been impressively high. Small libraries
have higher ARCCs than large libraries, but small libraries are
not as representative and are therefore not as good at
classifying novel isolates (from outside the library) as are
large libraries (Moore et al., 2005; Wiggins et al., 2003). Thus,
ARCC, and conceptually related tests such as jackknife
analysis, are better termed internal accuracy (Moore et al.,
2005; Stoeckel and Harwood, 2007). They do not estimate the
ability of a method to identify fecal sources, unknowns,
environmental isolates, or known-source isolates from outside the library, and can be misleading if interpreted as doing
so. Because many methods of fecal source tracking have been
assessed only in this way, the ability to compare them is
limited.

3.2.

Culture-based, library-dependent methods

3.2.1.

Antibiotic resistance

Multiple antibiotic resistance methods (MAR, ARA, and ARP)
test isolates of E. coli or enterococci against panels of
antibiotics in order to discriminate human and various
animal sources of fecal pollution (Carroll et al., 2005; Edge
and Hill, 2005; Hagedorn et al., 1999; Harwood et al., 2000,
2003; Parveen et al., 1997; Wiggins et al., 1999). The underlying
assumption is that because humans, agricultural animals,
and wildlife have been exposed to different antibiotic
regimes, their fecal bacteria will differ in types and levels of
antibiotic resistance. This assumption fails when different
antibiotics used for humans and agricultural animals belong
to the same classes of antibiotics and share the same
resistance mechanisms, and when wildlife in proximity to
livestock are exposed to antibiotics or resistance genes
through consumption of livestock feed and waste. Souza
et al. (1999) found that isolates from Mexican wild animals
were as resistant to antibiotics as isolates from humans in
cities.
Antibiotic resistance traits in bacteria are often borne on
plasmids, are under strong selective pressure, and change
rapidly following exposure to antibiotics and other chemicals.
Traits can be so labile that resistance of individual isolates

3521

changes within the course of a single source-tracking study
(Samadpour et al., 2005). Thus, antibiotic resistance is not
geographically or temporally stable (Ebdon and Taylor, 2006).
In addition, source-tracking studies have often used nonstandard antibiotic resistance methods, inappropriate media,
arbitrary chosen levels of antibiotics, non-standardized
inoculum, and no appropriate positive and negative controls,
leading to irreproducible results.
Comparative studies have given antibiotic resistance methods low ratings (Harwood et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2005;
Samadpour et al., 2005). In several comparative studies,
antibiotic resistance-based methods performed poorly at
identifying blind samples (Griffith et al., 2003; Moore et al.,
2005; Samadpour et al., 2005).

3.2.2.

Other phenotypic methods

In carbon-source utilization profiling (CUP), also called
biochemical or phenotypic fingerprinting, commercially
available microplate systems containing substrates for bacterial growth (e.g., Biolog, PhPlate) are used to generate
patterns of substrate utilization of FIB isolates. The approach
has passed the test of biological likelihood (Ahmed et al.,
2005a, b; Evenson and Strevett, 2006; Hagedorn et al., 2003;
Wallis and Taylor, 2003) However, CUP performed poorly in
two comparative studies (Blanch et al., 2006; Griffith et al.,
2003; Harwood et al., 2003). Because of the requirement for
many antisera, the serotyping approach has not been pursued
past an initial proof-of-concept study (Parveen et al., 2001).
Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiling for source tracking is
at the proof-of-concept and biological likelihood level of
testing (Duran et al., 2006; Genthner et al., 2005; Haznedaroglu
et al., 2005; Parveen et al., 2001; Seurinck et al., 2006a). FAME
has not been tested with isolates from outside the libraries
used to prepare the classification schemes, nor has it been
compared to other methods.

3.2.3. DNA fingerprinting: ribotyping, REP-PCR, PFGE, and
related methods
Genotypic library-based methods applied to source tracking
include ribotyping (Carson et al., 2001, 2003; Hartel et al., 2002;
Myoda et al., 2003; Parveen et al., 1999; Samadpour and
Chechowitz, 1995), repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) with REP, BOX, or ERIC
primers (Carson et al., 2003; Dombek et al., 2000; Indest et al.,
2005; Johnson et al., 2004; McLellan et al., 2003), amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (Guan et al., 2002;
Leung et al., 2004), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
(Myoda et al., 2003), random amplified DNA polymorphisms
(Venieri et al., 2004), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Sigler and Pasutti, 2006). All are variants of DNA
fingerprinting techniques.
For fingerprint methods, the protocol is important. For
example, currently there are two different ribotyping protocols in use. The protocol developed by Samadpour (Griffith
et al., 2003; Myoda et al., 2003; Samadpour and Chechowitz,
1995) uses two restriction enzymes (EcoR1 and PvuII), while
other investigators have used a HindIII-based ribotyping
protocol (Carson et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2005; Parveen
et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2003). The two-enzyme protocol did
well at identifying blind samples in comparative studies,



ARTICLE IN PRESS
3522

WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

while the single-enzyme protocol did not (Moore et al., 2005;
Myoda et al., 2003; Stoeckel et al., 2004). In addition, size of
the library is extremely important, as is the method of
analysis (Albert et al., 2003; Hassan et al., 2005; Indest et al.,
2005; Johnson et al., 2004; Leung et al., 2004; Stoeckel et al.,
2004). Depending on the size of the library, many to most
environmental isolates cannot be matched to fecal isolates
(Hassan et al., 2005; Stoeckel et al., 2004). It is necessary to
discard these unmatched isolates; identifying them based on
similarity to, rather than identity with, known isolates results
in incorrect classifications (Myoda et al., 2003; Stoeckel et al.,
2004). Ribotyping, PFGE, and REP-PCR have progressed to the
methods comparison stage of testing; the other fingerprinting
methods have not.
Sigler and Pasutti (2006) proposed DGGE fingerprinting of
community E. coli beta-glucuronidase (uid) genes to identify
sources in the environment without the need to grow and
analyze individual isolates. If successful, this would bypass
the most time-consuming and labor-intensive stages of
fingerprint analyses. However, a sequence-based study of
this gene found a dearth of host-specific variants (Ram et al.,
2004). This approach has not progressed past the biological
likelihood stage.

3.2.4.

Other genotypic library-based methods

Ram et al. (2004) explored sequencing uid genes from E. coli
isolates for source tracking. They found few host-specific
alleles (2 in birds, 3 in humans). Their ‘‘internal consistency’’
(ability to correctly assign isolates that had been used in
preparing the library to the correct host) was 60–75%. This
method has not been tested past the proof-of-concept stage.

3.3.

Culture-based, library-independent methods

3.3.1.

Bacteriophage methods

Certain strains of Bacteroides fragilis will grow bacteriophages
only from human sewage and others will support phage
growth from both human and animal feces (Puig et al., 1999;
Tartera and Jofre, 1987; Tartera et al., 1989). These phages do
not occur commonly in some parts of the world, including the
US and Canada (Payan et al., 2005). To overcome this, a
method of isolating new B. thetaiotaomicron and B. ovatus host
strains, useful for source discrimination in different geographic areas, was developed and shows promise (Payan
et al., 2005), but has not been tried in North America.
Bacteroides phage source discrimination has been tested in
Europe and South Africa and was considered strong in a
comparative study (Blanch et al., 2006; Grabow et al., 1995;
Payan et al., 2005), but has not been tested with blind
samples.
Serotyping or genotyping F+ RNA coliphages can distinguish human and animal feces (Cole et al., 2003; Furuse et al.,
1981; Hartly et al., 1975; Schaper et al., 2002; Stewart et al.,
2006; Stewart-Pullaro et al., 2006). In a comparative study, the
method did well at identifying blind samples of sewage/
human wastewater but missed some individual human
samples (Noble et al., 2003). In a methods comparison in
Europe, considerable variation from the expected pattern of
genotype distribution in animals was observed (Blanch et al.,
2006).

Phage methods are currently limited to discriminating
between human and non-human sources. Phage types
exhibit differential survival (Long and Sobsey, 2004), affecting
the ability to discriminate over time and quantitatively.
Markers are irregularly distributed in populations and may
work better in some geographic areas and when fecal
sources comprise multiple individuals (such as sewage)
rather than single individuals (Noble et al., 2003; Payan
et al., 2005). Molecular detection and/or molecular typing
are replacing culture-based methods (Hsu et al., 1995; Vinje
et al., 2004).

3.3.2.

Bacterial methods

An earlier method to distinguish human from non-human
fecal contamination was based on the ratio of fecal streptococci to fecal coliforms (Geldreich, 1976). But because coliforms and streptococci have different survival rates, the ratio
changes in complex ways over time, making it unreliable
(Sinton et al., 1993, 1998). A recent approach suggests that the
ratio of atypical colonies to total coliform colonies from a
membrane filter assay could differentiate human and agricultural fecal impacts (Booth and Brion, 2004; Nieman and
Brion, 2003). Changes in this ratio are related not only to the
source (human versus agricultural) of the contamination, but
also to the age of the source, compromising its overall utility.
The method has passed the test of biological likelihood but
has not undergone comparative testing.
Several MST methods are based on culturing host-specific
bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis and
sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria for humans (Bonjoch
et al., 2005; Lynch et al., 2002; Mara and Oragui, 1983, 1985;
Resnick and Levin, 1981), and Rhodococcus coprophilus for
grazing animals (Mara and Oragui, 1983, 1985; Rowbotham
and Cross, 1977; Savill et al., 2001). Sorbitol-fermenting
bifidobacteria are associated with human wastes (although
they occur rarely in pigs; Long et al., 2005). Environmental
survival of these bacteria is brief and they cannot be detected
at higher (summer) temperatures (Bonjoch et al., 2005; Carillo
et al., 1985; Resnick and Levin, 1981; Rhodes and Kator, 1999).
This method has been tested in the US, Europe, and South
Africa (Blanch et al., 2006; Bonjoch et al., 2005; Jagals and
Grabow, 1996; Long et al., 2005), but not with blind samples. It
was considered a strong method for distinguishing human
from animal feces in a methods comparison study in Europe
(Blanch et al., 2006).

3.4.

Culture-independent, library-dependent methods

3.4.1.

Community fingerprinting

Proof-of-concept studies have not been published for source
tracking by community fingerprinting with terminal restriction fragment length analysis (T-RFLP). Because of complex,
overlapping peak patterns from feces, as well as ‘‘background’’ peaks from environmental bacteria present in water,
the applicability of the method to environmental samples or
those with more than one fecal source is unknown. This
technique did not perform well at identifying blind samples
(Field et al., 2003; Griffith et al., 2003).
A similar approach used cluster analysis to compare T-RFLP
patterns from Bacteroides-Prevotella fecal DNAs derived from



ARTICLE IN PRESS
WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

chickens, cows, deer, pigs, dogs, geese, horses, humans, and
gulls (Fogarty and Voytek, 2005). There was great overlap
among host species, and although cluster analyses separated
the patterns obtained from single host species, no speciesspecific diagnostic peaks were found. It is therefore unlikely
that the technique could identify fecal sources mixed
together in environmental samples. The method has not
advanced beyond the proof-of-concept stage.

3.5.

Culture-independent, library-independent methods

3.5.1.

Chemical methods

Caffeine (Buerge et al., 2003; Burkhardt et al., 1999; Standley
et al., 2000), fecal sterols and stanols (Bull et al., 2002; Edwards
et al., 1998; Elhmmali et al., 2000; Standley et al., 2000;
Suprihatin et al., 2003; Takada and Eganhouse, 1998), bile
acids (Bull et al., 2002; Elhmmali et al., 2000; Isobe et al., 2002;
Leeming et al., 1996; Nichols et al., 1993; Puglisi et al., 2003),
laundry brighteners (Close et al., 1989; Sinton et al., 1998),
surfactants including linear alkyl benzenes (Eganhouse et al.,
1983), fragrances (Standley et al., 2000; Takada and Eganhouse, 1998), pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Standley et al., 2000; Takada and Eganhouse, 1998) can
be used to detect human and non-human fecal contamination and determine urban and agricultural runoff. Standley
et al. (2000) concluded that a combined index of caffeine and
fragrance levels identified human sewage; a ratio between
particular steroids identified agricultural input; and a different steroid ratio identified wildlife input. Profiling of seven
sterols in South Australian metropolitan catchments suggested areas of human, dog, and bird fecal impact (Suprihatin
et al., 2003). A comparison of fecal sterols from the Santa Ana
River in California found that ratios were inconsistent with
sewage; concentrations of FIB were correlated with occurrence of bird fecal sterols (Noblet et al., 2004). In a methods
comparison study, investigators found that the relative
amounts of two sterols, 24-ethyylcoprostanol and coprostanol, reliably distinguished human and non-human samples
(Blanch et al., 2006). These methods have not undergone
testing with blind samples.
Although presence of chemical indicators and molecular
tracers can identify fecal inputs, their spread, transport,
and persistence in water may not be correlated with that
of pathogens and FIB. Survival of indicators and pathogens
in water is affected by factors such as settling, insolation,
UV irradiation, and grazing (Brookes et al., 2005; Sinton et al.,
2002; Whitman et al., 2004); these factors affect chemical
indicators differently (Dureth et al., 1986). Wastewater
treatment efficiently removes some chemical markers
such as caffeine (Buerge et al., 2003, 2006) but not others.
The persistence of sterols and stanols is influenced by
whether they are in aerobic or anaerobic environments;
degradation may occur within 2 weeks in the water
column but be extremely slow in sediments (Bartlett, 1987).
Bile acids are so stable to degradation that they have been
recovered at archeological sites, e.g., to identify Roman
latrines (Bull et al., 2002). Finally, some chemical markers
are stored in sediments and resuspended, sometimes
decades later (Eganhouse et al., 1983; Eganhouse and
Sherblom, 2001).

3.5.2.

3523

Molecular methods

In these methods, a genetic marker is assayed directly from a
water sample or from DNA extracted from a water sample,
without an intervening culture step. The methods assay
specific marker genes by the PCR; for that reason they are also
called ‘‘host-specific PCR.’’ The approach speeds up the
process of source tracking, and allows access to novel
markers that would be difficult or impossible to detect by
growth assays. These methods can theoretically take as little
as 2 or 3 h from sampling to diagnosis.

3.5.2.1. Viral methods. Fecal viruses can be monitored directly in water, without culturing (reviewed in Fong and Lipp,
2005; Griffin et al., 2003). Along with the F+ specific RNA
phages reviewed above, human-specific examples include
adenoviruses (Fong et al., 2005; Hundesa et al., 2006; Jiang
et al., 2001; Pina et al., 1998; Puig et al., 2000), enteroviruses
(Fong et al., 2005; Griffin et al., 1999; Noble and Fuhrman,
2001; Puig et al., 2000; Tsai et al., 1993), and polyoma virus
(McQuaig et al., 2006). Teschoviruses (Jimenez-Clavero et al.,
2003) and adenoviruses (Hundesa et al., 2006; Maluquer de
Motes et al., 2004) can identify pigs; and bovine/ovine
adenoviruses (Hundesa et al., 2006; Maluquer de Motes
et al., 2004), polyoma viruses (Hundesa et al., 2006), and
enteroviruses (Jimenez-Clavero et al., 2005; Ley et al., 2002)
identify cows. The human viruses appear to be highly hostspecific; they have been monitored in surface waters in the
US and Europe. In the US and Spain, bovine enteroviruses
are not species-specific, occurring in cattle, deer, sheep,
goats, horses, and geese (Jimenez-Clavero et al., 2005). Porcine
teschoviruses have thus far only been found in pigs (JimenezClavero et al., 2003).
Monitoring for viruses may require water samples larger
than the 100 ml samples used for FIB monitoring. Concentration of large samples can concentrate PCR-inhibitory substances as well, interfering with detection (Jiang et al., 2001;
Straub and Chandler, 2003; Surbeck et al., 2006). To increase
sensitivity, investigators may use nested PCR (Jiang et al.,
2001; Maluquer de Motes et al., 2004; McQuaig et al., 2006),
which compromises quantitative detection. Real-time PCR
assays can quantify enteric viruses and adenovirus (Boehm
et al., 2003; Choi and Jiang, 2005; He and Jiang, 2005; JimenezClavero et al., 2003, 2005; Monpoeho et al., 2000).
Many of these assays have not been tested past the proof-ofconcept or biological-likelihood stages. However, assays for
the detection and typing of adenoviruses, enteroviruses and
F+ specific coliphages were used in a comparative sourcetracking study with blind samples. The viral methods
performed well in detecting human sewage, although they
often missed individual human fecal samples (Noble et al.,
2003). These methods are particularly important because
some directly detect viral pathogens, which are not well
correlated with FIB, thus giving some information on pathogen status that is not provided by indicator counts.
3.5.2.2. Anaerobic bacterial genes. Many fecal anaerobic bacteria (e.g., in the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides) have
host-specific distributions (Allsop and Stickler, 1985; Fiksdal
et al., 1985; Kreader, 1995; Resnick and Levin, 1981). Fecal
anaerobes, the majority of bacterial cells in feces, are present



ARTICLE IN PRESS
3524

WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

at much higher densities than coliforms and enterococci
(Savage, 2001). These anaerobes were not commonly used as
indicators until the advent of molecular detection, due to the
difficulties associated with cultivating fecal anaerobes. They
are expected to have limited or no reproduction after release
into receiving waters. ‘‘Uncultivated’’ bacteria can provide
host-specific molecular markers, and are more common in
feces than cultivated ones (Eckburg et al., 2005). Ribosomal
RNA genes are often used as targets. Host-specific protein
gene targets from fecal anaerobes have also been identified
(Shanks et al., 2006b, 2007). The advantage of protein gene
targets is that unlike the highly conserved ribosomal genes,
some (such as bacterial cell surface proteins) may be the
determinants of host specificity, making horizontal transfer
unlikely.
Bacteroidales host-specific PCR primers based on uncultivated
microbes can identify feces from ruminants, humans, dogs,
pigs, horses, and elk (Bernhard and Field, 2000a; Dick et al.,
2005a, b; Layton et al., 2006; Okabe et al., 2007). A PCR assay
for B. thetaiotaomicron distinguishes human and dog feces
from other animals (Carson et al., 2005). The limit of detection
of Bacteroidales host-specific markers is comparable to the
limit of detection of E. coli by culture (Bernhard and Field,
2000a; Bernhard et al., 2003; Bower et al., 2005; Dick and Field,
2004). Markers persist long enough to be detectable in natural
water samples. These assays are geographically stable, and
have been used throughout the United States and Canada
(Bernhard and Field, 2000a; Bernhard et al., 2003; Boehm et al.,
2003; Bower et al., 2005; Kreader, 1995; Lamendella et al., 2006;
Scott et al., 2005; Shanks et al., 2006a; Sosiak and Dixon, 2006;
Vogel et al., 2007; Walters et al., 2007), northern Europe
(Seurinck et al., 2005a, b), Hawaii (Betancourt and Fujioka,
2006), Japan (Okabe et al., 2007), and New Zealand (Gilpin
et al., 2003). Bacteroidales markers also correlate with sewage
and FIB (Dick and Field, 2004; Layton et al., 2006), and some
predict the occurrence of zoonotic pathogens (Walters et al.,
2007). In a comparison of fecal source-tracking methods,
host-specific PCR of Bacteroidales molecular markers performed well (Field et al., 2003; Griffith et al., 2003).
Limitations of this approach include lack of host-specific
markers, especially for wildlife. In addition, horizontal
transfer of fecal bacteria occurs among species in close
contact, e.g., humans and their pets (Caugant et al., 1984; Dick
et al., 2005a; Whittam et al., 1989). Because molecular
markers potentially move from one species to another,
specificity must be tested whenever Bacteroidales PCR markers
are used.
Similar approaches have targeted Bifidobacterium dentium,
B. adolescentis, and animal-specific Bifidobacterium species
(Bonjoch et al., 2004; Nebra et al., 2003), with mixed results
for specificity. However, environmental survival of bifidobacteria may be so limited as to affect their usefulness as an indicator
(Bernhard and Field, 2000b; Carillo et al., 1985; Resnick and
Levin, 1981). Molecular detection of bifidobacteria for source
tracking has undergone comparative testing in Europe, where it
was not considered to be a strong method (Blanch et al., 2006),
but has not been tested against blind samples.

3.5.2.3. Toxin/virulence genes. PCR-based source-tracking assays have targeted host-specific toxin genes in E. coli and

enterococci. Advantages include host specificity and geographic stability (since the toxin-containing strains are
known to occur worldwide). Targets from E. coli include the
human-specific STIb toxin (Oshiro and Olson, 1997), the pigspecific STIb toxin (Khatib et al., 2003), and the cattle-specific
LTIIa toxin (Chern et al., 2004; Khatib et al., 2002). Similarly,
the enterococcal surface protein (esp), a virulence factor from
Enterococcus faecium, is the target for a human-specific PCR
assay (Scott et al., 2005). The human-specific assay was
designed to selectively amplify a human variant esp from Ent.
faecium (Leavis et al., 2004). In a US test, 97% of human sewage
and septage samples, but no livestock or bird samples, were
positive for this esp marker (Scott et al., 2005).
A drawback of assays that detect virulence genes is that the
target genes are rare. To detect in 100 ml water samples, the
amount of target must be increased by either enriching E. coli
or enterococci (Scott et al., 2005), or performing nested PCR or
magnetic bead capture (Tsai et al., 2003). Detection is thus
semi-quantitative. If enrichment is used, the method is not
culture-independent, and will take longer than methods that
directly sample genes without an intervening growth step.
However, the method is likely to work without enrichment in
larger water samples.
A second potential drawback is instability due to horizontal
transfer of genes or cells. Horizontal transmission of fecal
enterococci occurs between humans and animals (van den
Bogaard et al., 2002). Bacterial virulence genes are carried in
pathogenicity islands (Knapp et al., 1986; Leavis et al., 2004),
which also undergo horizontal transfer (Coburn et al., 2007).
Conjugative transfer of enterococcal virulence genes can
occur even between bacterial species, e.g. Ent. faecalis to Ent.
faecium (Oancea et al., 2004). In a California study, the human
E. coli toxin gene marker occurred in a non-human fecal
sample, possibly due to horizontal transfer (Field et al., 2003).
In a comparative study, host-specific PCR of E. coli toxin
genes performed well at identifying blind samples (Field et al.,
2003). The enterococcus toxin gene method has not been
compared to other methods or assessed for its ability to
identify blind samples, although it has been applied in a
second study in Michigan (Liu et al., 2006). A multiplex PCR
assay for several enterococcus virulence genes could potentially be useful for source tracking (Vankerckhoven et al.,
2004). Gordon (2001) proposed multiplexed PCR detection of E.
coli virulence factors to produce virulence ‘‘fingerprints’’ for
source discrimination.

3.5.2.4. Rhodococcus coprophilus. Culture-based detection of
this bacterial indicator of fecal contamination from herbivores (cow, sheep, horse, and deer) is slow. Detection by PCR
and quantification by QPCR is specific and sensitive (Savill
et al., 2001).
3.5.2.5. Host mitochondrial sequences. Martellini et al. (2005)
developed PCR primers targeting host mitochondrial gene
sequences. Hosts shed their own blood and intestinal cells in
feces. Although not limited to fecal sources, these cells would
in theory make excellent host-specific targets, since unlike
bacteria they are not found in multiple hosts and cannot
spread among species, except transiently after consumption
of meat (Caldwell et al., 2007 (in press)). However, initial



ARTICLE IN PRESS
WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

studies had many problems with specificity and limits of
detection (Martellini et al., 2005). In a second study, assays for
human, pig, and bovine mitochondrial genes were specific
and allowed largely correct identification of blind samples
(Caldwell et al., 2007 (in press)), but the lowest amount of
feces the method could detect by real-time PCR was
estimated as 0.2 g feces per 100 ml water, calling into question
the usefulness of the approach with real water samples.
Because these markers are rare in feces, larger water samples
may be needed to detect them.

3.5.3. Novel methods of marker development
3.5.3.1. Subtractive hybridization. Dick et al. (2005b) used
subtractive hybridization, a method of empirically selecting
unique gene fragments, to develop Bacteroidales-based
PCR primers to separate closely related or associated
groups (humans and dogs; ruminant species). A dog-specific
marker performed well in a comparative study using
blind samples (Field et al., 2003). Shanks et al. (2006b, 2007)
also used subtractive hybridization to identify cattle- and
human-specific protein gene targets in fecal Bacteroidales. The
Shanks studies are good example of careful establishment of
the prevalence and geographic stability of new markers,
although the new markers have not been tested in comparative studies. The Dick and Shanks studies began with total
fecal DNAs from known hosts, allowing markers to be
selected from uncultivated but dominant fecal bacteria.
Resulting genetic markers had broad geographic distributions, and occurred in most individual hosts of the species in
question.
Hamilton et al. (2006) also used subtractive hybridization,
but began with DNAs from E. coli isolates from known hosts.
They developed hybridization probes specific to geese and
ducks. These were applied in novel high-throughput, macroarray-based assays (Yan et al., 2006). They have not been
tested in comparative studies against blind samples.

3.5.3.2. Microarray analyses. Soule et al. (2006) screened
microarrays developed from Enterococcus isolates from known
host species to identify potential host-specific probes. Genetic
markers developed from FIB isolates in this study and the
Hamilton study (Hamilton et al., 2006) showed less specificity
and had a somewhat narrower geographic range than
markers based on uncultivated bacteria (Dick et al., 2005b;
Shanks et al., 2006b, 2007).
3.6.
Culture-independent versus culture-based and
culture-dependent methods
3.6.1.

Advantages and limitations of culture-based methods

Culturing fecal indicator organisms is relatively inexpensive
and low-tech, making it broadly available. Another advantage
of culturing is that it provides an enrichment step, increasing
the numbers of target microorganisms and/or providing
single strains in isolation. Culture-based methods often use
FIB, for which some information about survival, transport,
and correlation with pathogens and disease is already
available.
However, the use of FIB is also a disadvantage, as FIB may
not provide the diversity and host-specific population struc-

3525

ture needed for source tracking. For example, in E. coli, little of
the genetic diversity measured by multi-locus enzyme
electrophoresis is explained by geographical structure or host
specificity (Gordon et al., 2002).
Culture-based methods are limited to testing easily cultivated microbes. Many pathogens, and even the most common fecal bacteria, are difficult to grow. In addition, the
composition of microbial communities changes drastically
when cultured (e.g., see Ferguson et al., 1984). This ‘‘culture
bias’’ is rarely considered in culture-based fecal source
identification, and has important implications for attempts
to use these methods quantitatively. In addition, after
enrichment, detection can only be semi-quantitative. The
low price of culturing may be offset if the source identification
method that is applied to the cultured isolates is high-tech
and expensive (e.g., PFGE and AFLP). Library-based methods
are labor intensive, requiring extensive sampling both to
prepare the library and to test environmental isolates. They
have complex requirements for adequate sample size,
representativeness, and geographic stability (Ebdon and
Taylor, 2006; Harwood et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2004; Myoda
et al., 2003; Wiggins et al., 2003). For some methods, libraries
are not cosmopolitan, and thus a separate library for each
locale or catchment may be required (Hartel et al., 2002;
Parveen et al., 2001; Scott et al., 2003); however, these studies
were based on libraries of limited size.

3.6.2. Advantages and limitations of culture-independent
molecular methods
These methods have the advantage of sampling the entire
population present in the sample, with no culture bias. In
addition, they are simpler and quicker than culture-based
methods; they may require only a few hours to detect fecal
pollution and identify its source. They do not require prior
preparation of a ‘‘library,’’ as the markers are in most cases
universal or nearly so. They are not limited to easy-tocultivate microbes, but can instead use difficult-to-grow but
common fecal microbes or mine the uncultivated genetic
diversity in feces for markers.
However, host-specific markers may not be present in
every individual of a species, and individuals may have
differing amounts of the markers. As a result, these methods
often work better to detect ‘‘bulk’’ or community samples
(such as sewage/wastewater, for humans) rather than samples from single individuals. In addition, although libraries
are not needed for every location, validation with local
samples is required when the methods are applied in new
locales (USEPA, 2005). Also, some markers may be small
(viruses) or rare (toxin genes, host intestinal cells), potentially
requiring large water samples or an enrichment step to
detect them.
A drawback of using any markers other than FIB is that
their survival relative to, and correlation with, standard fecal
indicators and pathogens are poorly known. Since regulations
are currently based on FIB, any other markers must be
correlated with FIB in order for them to be most useful.
A further limitation of the culture-independent methods is
that markers for only a few animal species are currently
available; wildlife species especially are poorly represented.
More and different gene targets are needed.

Inability to detect a source

A ‘‘negative’’ test, or inability to detect a source-tracking
marker, does not provide unequivocal proof that a particular
source is absent, as it will be influenced by complex
interacting factors including the limits of detection of the
test, presence of inhibiting/competing substances, and rate of
die-off or removal of the marker (such as by waste treatment).
These limitations apply to all methods, and are of concern if
the rate of die-off of a marker is faster than that of pathogens.

comparative or blind-sample analyses. Ranking is based on
original data when possible; data interpretation, reanalysis,
novel statistics, and the like in subsequent publications may
have obscured results in some cases.
Several small comparative studies (e.g., Carson et al., 2003;
Leung et al., 2004) not based on blind or non-library samples
are not included in this comparison, as their scope and
methodological limitations make it difficult to compare them
to the others.

sets of water samples containing human, cattle, dog, or gull
feces, sewage/human wastewater, or a mixture, along with
samples of the feces used to create the unknowns. Participants used coliphage and virus-based approaches, antibiotic
resistance, carbon utilization profiling, ribotyping, REP-PCR,
PFGE, community DNA profiling, and host-specific PCR of
E. coli toxin genes and Bacteroidales molecular markers.
Methods were assessed based on correct identification of
samples that contained human feces or human wastewaters,
correct identification of each fecal source, quantification of
fecal contributions, and ability to handle different sample
matrices (freshwater, saltwater, and humic acids).
Host-specific PCR (of E. coli toxin genes and Bacteroidales
markers) was very accurate at identifying samples with
human feces and sewage/human wastewater, with no false
positives, and correctly identified those species for which
each had markers. At the time of the study there were
Bacteroidales host-specific PCR markers for human, ruminant,
and dog, but not gull, and E. coli toxin gene markers for
human and cow but not gull and dog. Ribotyping (Samadpour
protocol) and PFGE (Samadpour protocol) correctly identified
human samples, and also identified all four sources. Several
of the others, including phenotypic and genotypic librarybased methods, identified some or all samples with human
input, but at the cost of very significant numbers of false
positives (samples identified as containing human input that
did not). The virus-based methods worked well at identifying
samples with sewage/human wastewater but less well at
identifying samples with human feces. None of the methods
correctly identified all the sources in every sample. The same
approach did not perform equally well in the hands of
different investigators, underlining the need for standardization. No method accurately quantified the sources.

3.8.2. Comparison of library-dependent methods using a
small library
A second smaller study compared library-dependent methods
for E. coli (Stoeckel et al., 2004). Again, ribotyping and PFGE
worked well. It was notable that ribotyping with EcoRI and
PvuII approached 100% correct classification of unknown
isolates, but only 6% of the isolates could be classified.
Although this was in part due to the very small size of the
library in the study, it is also the same pattern seen in studies
cited above that compared genotypes of fecal and environmental strains: most environmental strains differ from fecal
strains. Thus fecal source tracking based on identification of
isolates should not be able to identify all isolates.

3.8.3.

HindIII ribotyping versus ARA

A third study compared the performance of ribotyping with a
single-enzyme (HindIII) protocol and antibiotic resistance
testing in classifying blind proficiency samples (Moore et al.,
2005). Only 28% (by ARA) and 27% (by ribotyping) of the E. coli
proficiency isolates were assigned to the correct source
category. In addition, this study showed poor agreement
between methods, suggesting that combining them would
not improve the accuracy of identification. This study
concluded ‘‘None of the methods performed well enough on
the proficiency panel to be judged ready for application to
environmental samples.’’

3.8.4.

3527

EcoRI/PvuII ribotyping versus ARA

A fourth study compared antibiotic resistance to ribotyping
with EcoRI and PvuII, using a set of 40 E. coli isolates from
seven hosts, provided blindly as triplicates (120 total unknowns) (Samadpour et al., 2005). Underscoring the instability of antibiotic resistance, individual isolates within triplicate
sets did not all share identical antibiotic resistance patterns;
in addition, some isolates changed antibiotic susceptibility
during the course of the study. All individual isolates within
triplicate sets did have matching ribotypes. Each ribotype
pattern was associated with a single host.
The difference in results reported in these comparative
studies may in part be due to study design (for example,
libraries too small), methodological considerations (for ribotyping, choice of enzymes seems to be the most significant
factor), poor choice of analysis (trying to identify isolates
based on similarity rather than identity) and operator error,
underlining the necessity of accurately establishing the
correct parameters for each method.

3.8.5.

European study

A multi-lab study compared several source-tracking methods,
including enumeration of coliphages, Bacteroides bacteriophages, and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, genotyping of
F-specific phages, phenotypic testing of E. coli and enterococci, PCR detection of B. dentium and B. adolescentis, and
measurement of fecal sterols (Blanch et al., 2006). Methods
were assessed separately, and also combined to develop
predictive models based on the lowest number of parameters.
This study was not an analysis of blind samples, although
blind tests were used to ensure inter-laboratory standardization; rather, geographically diverse known-source samples
were analyzed using all the methods and results were
examined to see which methods or combination of methods
resulted in the best discrimination between animal and
human sources. The two individual methods that achieved
the best discrimination were presence/absence of sorbitolfermenting bifidobacteria, and presence/absence of bacteriophage-infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GA17. The best
predictive model was achieved by plotting the ratio between
somatic coliphages and phages of B. thetaiotaomicron against
somatic coliphages. This model achieved 100% correct
classification (human versus non-human) of samples from
all the geographic areas, with no differences among areas.
Other possible combinations of methods also provided
effective discrimination. This study used highly contaminated wastewater slurry samples. The investigators plan to
study more environmentally realistic samples such as dilute
or complex mixtures, as well as marker persistence in the
environment. In addition, the ‘‘best’’ methods found in the
study should be challenged against blind proficiency samples.

3.9.

Fecal source tracking using combined methods

As no single source-tracking method is ideal, some have
suggested combining methods (Griffith et al., 2003; Santo
Domingo et al., 2007 (submitted to this issue); Stewart et al.,
2003; USEPA, 2005), in order to enhance discrimination or
provide confirmation of results. Boehm et al. (2003)
used intensive testing for FIB to spatially locate areas of

contamination and characterize variability in Catalina Bay.
They followed this with targeted assays for human-specific
Bacteroidales and enteroviruses to identify the source of the
contamination. They identified multiple sources; the spatial
component of their sampling allowed them to locate specific
sources, including a leaking graywater pipe.
In a second study, intensive FIB sampling in a watershed
emptying into Santa Monica Bay was combined with molecular detection of enteroviruses, a human-specific Bacteroidales marker, and enterococci (Noble et al., 2006). Finally,
investigators sequenced amplified enterovirus sequences to
confirm the presence of potential risks to human health.
Although the entire creek had high FIB levels, high humanspecific and viral indicators in specific areas indicated where
mitigation would be the most effective.
Genthner et al. (2005) combined REP-PCR fingerprinting,
antibiotic resistance analysis, and FAME profiling of
Ent. faecalis isolates. They were unable to differentiate hostderived clusters with FAME, but concluded that the combination of REP-PCR and ARA increased their ability to assign
beach/swash zone isolates as either human- or gull-derived.
They identified most isolates as gull. However, there
appeared to be no matches among environmental and fecal
isolates to support this identification. REP-PCR clustered
human, gull, and beach isolates in separate lineages; ARA
placed beach isolates in a discrete lineage, with gull and
human isolates intermingled in lineages. This study therefore
appears to support the existence of unique environmental
lineages, rather than identifying them as human- or gullderived.
In New Zealand, investigators combined identification of
host-specific Bifidobacterium, Rhodococcus, and Bacteroides with
assays for fluorescent whitening agents and fecal sterols/
stanols (Gilpin et al., 2003). They were able to identify human
contamination, but found that animal input was more
difficult to characterize.
In a creek catchment in rural Nebraska, Vogel et al. (2007)
combined coliphage typing, PCR of Bacteroidales markers, and
a library-based source-tracking method, rep-PCR of E. coli
isolates. This study followed validation guidelines published
by the US EPA (USEPA, 2005). Although the creek was impaired
based on levels of E. coli, they could only detect coliphages in
one sample. In spite of poor detection of Bacteroidales
ruminant markers, results of the other two approaches were
interpreted as being similar in supporting primarily wildlife
and cattle sources for the contamination. The study raised
many questions; for example, why were coliphages not
detected? If cattle input was important, why did they not
detect ruminant Bacteroidales markers in water samples?
These results suggest that better information on how to
combine methods is needed.

3.10.
Water quality improvement resulting from source
tracking
There is a very great need for studies that measure water
quality improvements that resulted from source tracking;
that is, step 6, the ‘‘proof is in the pudding’’ testing (Fig. 1). For
example, of the eight studies, using a variety of methods,
given as examples in a USEPA source-tracking guidance

document (USEPA, 2005), only one provides such data. One
frequently cited paper (Hagedorn et al., 1999) has flaws that
do not allow the results to be assessed. The study used
antibiotic resistance patterns in enterococci to determine that
cows were the dominant source of fecal pollution in an
impaired stream in Virginia. However, after fencing was used
to restrict cattle access to the stream, the numbers of
enterococci did not go down, as would be expected if the
source tracking resulted in a reduction in fecal contamination. Furthermore, the authors of the paper used the
arithmetic mean, rather than the geometric mean, to draw
conclusions about indicator numbers, at variance with the
accepted approach. Finally, it is difficult to assess the stated
improvement in E. coli numbers, as there are errors in the data
presented, and the change in numbers of E. coli after the
fencing appears to reflect the influence of a single anomalously high sampling site.

4.

Is fecal source tracking quantitative?

Water quality regulators hope to use fecal source-tracking
methods quantitatively. If host-specific markers had similar
environmental survival/persistence, then quantifying each
would give an estimation of the relative contribution of each
source. However, little is known about the comparative
persistence or survival of source-specific markers and strains,
and the available data for markers ranging from E. coli
genotypes to Bacteroidales and phage markers indicate
strongly that survival is not proportional. Although practitioners often assume that markers based on E. coli or
enterococci are exactly proportional to FIB; this has not been
tested, and genetic studies have shown that populations of
E. coli in fresh feces differ from populations sampled from
habitats such as dry feces, animal bedding, septic tanks,
storage lagoons, and water samples (Anderson et al., 2005;
Gordon et al., 2002; McLellan, 2004; Whittam, 1989). The
general trend in the extra-intestinal environment is dominance of environmental strains that differ from strains in the
host. For example, McLellan compared diversity of E. coli in
the environment versus that in feces and found that rivers
and beaches were dominated by river and beach genotypes,
which differed from fecal genotypes even when heavy fecal
contamination was present (McLellan, 2004). A study that
used ribotyping to follow persistence and differential survival
of E. coli genotypes showed that some strains were more
persistent than others, and distribution of ribotypes in
environmental mesocosms was different from their distribution in feces (Anderson et al., 2005). In the field, differential
distribution of two Bacteroidales ruminant-specific markers
was correlated with salinity of the water, suggesting that
these bacteria may also show differential survival in relation
to environmental conditions (Bernhard et al., 2003). F+ RNA
phages used to discriminate human and animal fecal
contamination also exhibit differential survival (Long and
Sobsey, 2004). It is notable that even with very simple,
constructed samples for which investigators also had samples of source feces used to construct the samples, none of
the methods in a comparative study accurately quantified the
sources.



ARTICLE IN PRESS
WAT E R R E S E A R C H 4 1 ( 2 0 0 7 ) 3 5 1 7 – 3 5 3 8

These data suggest that although markers may be detected
quantitatively, quantitative estimates of the contribution of
different fecal sources may not follow. This may be particularly true for culture-based assays, where preferential growth
of readily cultivable strains can lead to bias. It is also worth
asking what is being quantified; is it the FIB contribution of
each source (in which case, the correlation of source-tracking
markers to FIB would be required), or is it some other
determinant of water quality, such as volume of feces,
nutrient loading, or pathogens?
Several quantitative PCR (QPCR) assays have been developed for Bacteroidales source-tracking markers (Kildare et al.,
2007 (submitted to this issue); Layton et al., 2006; Okabe et al.,
2007; Seurinck et al., 2005a; Stricker et al., 2006). In order to
comprehensively interpret the results of these Bacteroidales
QPCR assays in polluted water samples, however, relative
survival of the markers must be known. Evidence from
conventional PCR suggests that different Bacteroidales groups
may show differential survival or persistence in water
(Bernhard et al., 2003).
Similar caveats apply to the approach of Yan et al. (2006),
whose automated sampling methods, followed by macroarray
hybridization using previously developed goose/duck
probes (Hamilton et al., 2006), allowed them to rapidly
screen and analyze large numbers of E. coli isolates and
detect goose/duck-specific colonies. Without survival curves
of the goose/duck genotypes in comparison to other E. coli, it
is difficult to know how to interpret these results quantitatively. Previous work suggests that even in environments
heavily contaminated by birds, the E. coli populations
are dominated by environmental, not fecal genotypes
(McLellan, 2004).

5.
Shortcomings of fecal source tracking may
follow from the FIB paradigm
There is no single ideal source-tracking method in use to date.
Methods that are based on isolating indicator organisms are
slow and labor-intensive, many have unacceptable levels of
accuracy and false positives, and genetic evidence has shown
that the population makeup of indicator organisms in the
environment does not match fecal sources. Chemical methods and methods that are based on PCR of genetic markers do
not have markers for all species and are not necessarily
correlated with FIB. No method has adequately addressed the
question of survival and storage of host-specific markers in
the environment and their correlation with pathogens; even
marker resistance to different standard waste treatments has
rarely been addressed. No method has adequately addressed
the question of proportional survival of the species-specific
markers or indicators, meaning that no method, whether
culture-based, chemical, or based on QPCR, has been shown
to work quantitatively over time. Few methods have been
tested against blind samples and shown to accurately identify
fecal inputs. Of the few that were tested in this way,
only ribotyping, PFGE, and host-specific PCR were notably
accurate.
However, these shortcomings may result from shortcomings in the methods used to regulate water quality in the first

3529

place. The overarching purpose of water quality regulation is
to protect human health; the legal requirements make other
considerations, such as protection of environments, secondary. For many years this protection has been accomplished by
monitoring FIB. Recent regulations in the US require water
quality regulators to establish Total Maximum Daily Loads for
FIB along with other contaminants; this requirement contributes to the drive for source tracking.
Although the use of FIB to assess water quality has
unequivocally reduced human health risk, the current FIB
approaches fall short in several areas (see Section 1.3). As a
result of the exclusive emphasis on FIB in legislation, the
primary question that water quality regulators ask is ‘‘What
should I do about FIB in this water?’’ when the correct
question should be ‘‘How can I control pathogens in this
water to protect human health?’’
If the correct question is asked, additional questions follow:
First, what are the specific pathogen risks associated with the
body of water in question? Second, are those pathogens
present? If so, how do they enter the water? What is the
pathway of human exposure? How can the pathway best be
interrupted?
Answering these corollary questions could lead to a more
rational approach to protecting water quality. In this new
approach, FIB monitoring and fecal source tracking would be
removed from the central role and be given a place as tools in
risk assessment and pathogen control.

6.
A rational approach for protecting water
quality
The first task for a water quality regulator should be to list the
pathogens of concern for a particular body of water (Fig. 2). In
the US, county and state health departments maintain
epidemiological records of who is getting sick from waterborne disease, what pathogens are involved, and what the
likely pathways of exposure are (e.g., drinking water, recreation, and consumption of shellfish or field crops). These data
could be combined with a social and geographic inventory
and a sanitary survey to pinpoint specific pathogens and
specific locations of concern. For example, presence of
sewage or septage might highlight a potential for human
virus inputs; cattle operations might highlight a potential for
E. coli O157.
These data could be used to plan a monitoring program for
each body of water. Baseline monitoring of indicators would
reveal when more specific monitoring for pathogens was
necessary. The chosen indicators would have to be capable of
predicting the presence of the specific pathogens of concern,
however. For example, Clostridium may be a better indicator
for certain pathogenic protozoa than E. coli; Bacteroidales or
another indicator that cannot survive in the environment
may be appropriate for tropical areas and beaches where
E. coli and enterococci have established environmental
populations.
When levels of the appropriate indicators rise, then targeted
monitoring for pathogens could be undertaken. In this way,
expensive shotgun approaches would be avoided, but health
threats would be monitored. If there were no good indicators

for the pathogens of concern, then targeted pathogen
monitoring would be performed routinely. In addition,
targeted source tracking could be used as needed to identify
the source of pathogens, again avoiding expensive shotgun
approaches.
The emphasis should be on rapid indicators, rapid source
tracking, and rapid pathogen monitoring when possible;
beach closures, shellfish harvest restrictions, and the like
could be implemented and removed in response to direct
knowledge of pathogen status.
For source tracking, the best evidence supports taking a
multi-tiered approach (Boehm et al., 2003; Kuntz et al., 2003,
2004; Noble et al., 2006; USEPA, 2005), moving from general to
specific and from less to more expensive. After each step,
progress can be assessed before deciding to move to the next
one. The first step is always intensive sanitary surveys, to
target sources spatially and temporally. Once ‘‘hot spots’’ are
identified, their sources may be obvious even without any
specific MST (for example, leaky pipes or run-off from a
particular farm). If not, then very targeted source tracking can
start with less-expensive methods for distinguishing contamination associated with the pathogens of concern
(for example, cows for E. coli O157, humans for enteric virus).
More expensive or more comprehensive methods would
only be brought in to identify all species if needed (e.g., ducks
versus gulls versus shorebirds). Appropriate rapid methods
to distinguish human contamination would be chemical
methods (e.g., caffeine, laundry brighteners), host-specific
PCR (e.g., Bacteroidales molecular markers), and phage methods. The lowest tier of species identification could also be
host-specific PCR, to quickly identify common agricultural
and domestic animals. The final tier, if needed, would be a
library-based method to identify specific sources in more
detail.

7.

Future directions

We recommend two areas where progress could be made in
fecal source testing and water quality regulation: research
and improving the capabilities of water quality testing

laboratories. All potential source-tracking methods and
host-specific markers should be tested for their ability to
identify fecal inputs in blind samples. This is likely to reduce
the field of potential methods to a more manageable size.
Methods that pass this test need to be compared for
geographic and temporal stability and cost, in order to assess
when and where each would be most useful. The survival/
persistence of host-specific markers in the environment
should be tested, relative to other host-specific markers, fecal
indicators, and pathogens, and in response to standard waste
treatments. This will establish whether source tracking can
be used quantitatively, and also its ability to predict presence
of pathogens. Finally, epidemiological studies are needed to
establish the comparative human health risk from different
fecal sources.
In addition, in order to adopt more rational approaches for
water quality regulation, many local laboratories need to
retool and/or retrain to use rapid methods such as PCR.
Furthermore, laboratories in the US need to move beyond
strict reliance on 100 ml water samples. Many effective
methods require larger samples, especially if laboratories
simultaneously do targeted pathogen testing and source
tracking. The cost of additional personnel that may be needed
to handle field collections should be offset by improved
efficiency of testing.

Conclusions

 Information is lacking on the human health risks of nonhuman fecal contamination.

 Relatively few methods of fecal source tracking have
progressed beyond proof of concept testing and field
testing in situations where the ‘‘real’’ answer could only
be inferred.
 Only a few studies have challenged source-tracking
methods with blind, seeded water samples. Source-tracking methods that performed best in these small, designlimited comparative studies included ribotyping, PFGE,
and host-specific PCR. Phage- and virus-based methods
worked well to identify human sewage.

 Promising rapid source-tracking methods include PCR of
host-specific viruses, Bacteroidales, and toxin/virulence
genes, and detection of chemical markers such as sterols,
caffeine, and laundry products. These methods are
currently limited to identifying human and a few other
species. Promising culture-based methods for identification
of human contamination include presence/absence
of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, Bacteroides phages,
and F+ RNA phages. Promising methods for identifying
many different sources of indicators include ribotyping and
PFGE.
 Although host-specific markers can be quantified, source
tracking cannot truly be quantitative until survival/persistence ratios of host-specific markers in the environment
are established.
 Research is needed on correlation between host-specific
markers, FIB, and pathogens.
 Because legislation is based on FIB, monitoring emphasizes indicators, when the real concern should be pathogens. A more rationale approach to protect water quality
would use epidemiological data to identify pathogens of
concern in a specific water body, and then use targeted
pathogen monitoring coupled with targeted fecal source
tracking to control them.
