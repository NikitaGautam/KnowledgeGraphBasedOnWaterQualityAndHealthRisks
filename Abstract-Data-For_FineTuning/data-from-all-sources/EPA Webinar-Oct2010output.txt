Quantitative Microbial Risk
Analysis (QMRA) Status
(P4)
• Objective: obtain pathogen and fecal
indicator measurements from animal
source manure run-off for use in QMRA
• Approach: field study with simulated
rainfall and controlled application of fecal
material from cattle, poultry and swine
• Status/Results: results from two
simulations will be used in QMRA; late
September rains have now allowed for
sample collection for the stream run-off
studies

11

qPCR Signal Fate and
Transport (P8) Status
Objective: To evaluate how well molecular and culturebased indicators perform as surrogates for the
pathogens
Approach: measure pathogen and fecal indicator levels
in untreated and treated wastewater and persistence
in discharged effluents
Status/Results*
• Draft Report currently undergoing external peer review
• Enterococci qPCR measurements persisted more than
culture through chlorine and UV disinfection.
• Both qPCR and culture measurements degraded at
similar rates in discharged effluents.
• Pathogens were not found consistently or at sufficient
levels to assess persistence
12
*subject to change, based on external peer review comments and revision



Archived Sample Storage
and Re-analysis
Contingency (P16, P22)
• Reanalyze archived samples using new
indicators and develop health relationship
for new indicators (P22), if frozen archived
samples have not degraded (P16)

13

Sample Storage Stability
(P16)
• How long can refrigerated samples be
held before they should be processed for
analyses?
• How long can samples be stored frozen
before they significantly degrade?
• Have the frozen samples, archived from
previous EPA conducted epidemiology
studies, significantly degraded?
14



P16 Approach
• Short-term holding time: fresh
refrigerated samples were held and
analyzed at 24 and 48 hours
• Long-term holding time: frozen samples
were held and analyzed at 6, 12, and 24
months
• Archived sample stability: frozen
samples from 2003-2007 epidemiology
studies were analyzed
15

P16 Status/Results*
• Draft report undergoing peer review
• 24 and 48 hr results were limited, conflicting and difficult
to interpret
• 12 and 24 month samples were degraded
• Reanalyzed archived samples were degraded
• Conclusion: Archived samples should not be used for
establishing health relationships with new indicators
(P22)
• No recommendation on holding time due to inconclusive
results, but limited data suggests that refrigerated
samples should not be held for 24 hours or longer [Note: 6
hours used in NEEAR studies].

* Subject to change, based upon peer review comments and revision

Conduct Expert Scientific
Workshop
• Objective: Obtain input on what future
science and research might be conducted
to further improve our understanding of
potential human health risks from
exposure to fecal contamination from
avian and other wildlife in coastal
recreational waters.
• Date: Fall, 2011

28



Conduct statistical analysis of
children data from
epidemiologic studies - P29
•

Children assessed as a subpopulation in
all epidemiological studies
o Elevated risk in freshwater studies
o Other subpopulations (elderly, pregnant…) did not have sufficient
populations to assess

•

Assessment for marine studies ongoing (under peer review)

• Several potential factors
o Time spent in water, more likely to swallow water

29

Quantitative Microbial Risk
Assessment (QMRA) for
Agricultural Animals
• EPA is conducting a QMRA (project P4 in
CPSP) to estimate illness at a freshwater
beach impacted by agricultural animal
sources of fecal contamination.
• The risk assessment is based on microbes
that are pathogenic to humans (e.g., E.
coli O157:H7, Cryptosporidium, etc.) and
come from ag. animal sources.
30



Quantitative Microbial Risk
Assessment (QMRA) for
Agricultural Animals [cont.]
• Evaluated the risk assessment approach in
comparison to the NEEAR freshwater epi study
results – “anchoring”
• Conducted field studies with simulated rainfall
and controlled application of fecal material from
cattle, poultry and swine
• Surveyed the scientific literature for information
on zoonotic pathogen occurrence, distribution,
prevalence, infectivity, and other parameters for
use in the risk assessment.
31

Quantitative Microbial Risk
Assessment (QMRA) for
Agricultural Animals [cont.]
• Risk assessment is currently underway
• Incorporating the results from targeted
field studies into the exposure assessment
models
• Results should help inform on the relative
nature of human health risks from various
fecal sources
32



Enhanced Sanitary
Investigation Tool
• Enhanced sanitary investigation
instrument was developed that captures
information sufficient to support the
conduct of a QMRA
• The form was tested at EPA epi study
sites in 2009.
33

Validation of Analytical Methods
for Ambient Water Testing
• EPA completed a single-laboratory validation study of EPA's
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) procedures for the
quantitative detection of enterococci (Method A) and Bacteroidales
(Method B), in fresh and marine waters
• The purpose of the study was to:
o optimize the methods (to further refine)
o assess method performance in the single laboratory environment across
multiple matrices
o facilitate future modification of the two methods
o provide a basis for a multi(ple) laboratory validation study
o develop draft quantitative quality control (QC) acceptance criteria

• The draft methods are published (Method A: Enterococci EPA-821R-10-004 and Method B: Bacterdoidales EPA-822-R-10-003) on the
EPA web site at:
http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/method/biological/
• A multi-lab validation study for the two methods is underway for
marine waters and the freshwater study will begin next spring
34



Evaluation of Indicator/Method
Combinations
• EPA is evaluating indicator/method combinations for use
in new or revised criteria
• Performance criteria for important features being
evaluated include:
o
o
o
o
o
o

indicator/illness health relationship established
limit of detection
sensitivity
specificity
precision
percent false positives and false negatives

• Also evaluating qPCR and culture methods qualitatively
to determine, for implementation purposes,
appropriateness for each Clean Water Act program.
35

Indicators/Methods –
Wastewater
• EPA has determined, based on the preliminary results of
the studies in P8 and P18 that a new or revised
wastewater test method is not necessary.
• The preliminary results from the P8 study indicate that
the Enterococci qPCR method measures DNA levels in
both wastewater and receiving ambient waters.
• The preliminary results from the P18 study indicate that
existing culture methods approved for wastewater may
be sufficient.
• Therefore, based on the results available at this time, a
new wastewater method is not needed.
36



Other Indicator/Method
Efforts
•

Developing Approaches to Bring Additional
Indicator/Methods into Criteria


Establish scientifically defensible “equivalency” of
indicator/methods with an unknown health
relationship to indicator/methods with an established
health relationship.

37

Monitoring & Modeling
• EPA is preparing a report that describes the
temporal and spatial variation associated with water
sampling.
o Considerations for developing sampling plans for beach
monitoring
• Inland vs. coastal
• Where, when and how to sample

• Catalog and evaluate existing information on models
and other tools to predict water quality at beaches
and discuss protocols for model development.
• Predictive Models:
o Provide results in a “timely manner”
o Supplement to water sampling, not replacement
38



Inland Waters
• EPA is preparing a report to support its
evaluation of applicability of NEEAR Great
Lakes data to inland waters
o Summarizes work of EPA and WERF related to
assessing similarities and differences in inland
waters, including:
• Input from experts during February 2009 WERF Experts
Inland Waters Workshop
• Literature review of occurrence, persistence, fate & transport
of indicators and pathogens in inland v. coastal settings
• Comparison of Culture and qPCR methods
• Method performance in inland fresh waters
39

Literature Reviews
• EPA conducted literature reviews to establish the state
of the science in various areas related to criteria
development.
• Two reviews have been published on EPA’s recreational
water quality criteria website
o http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/recreation/
o “Review of Published Studies to Characterize Relative Risks
from Different Sources of Fecal Contamination in
Recreational Water”, EPA 822-R-09-001, CPSP P#30
o “Review of Zoonotic Pathogens in Ambient Waters”, EPA
822-R-09-002, CPSP P#31

• One other is in progress (i.e., incorporating the results of
EPA’s 2009 Boqueron, Puerto Rico efforts).
o “Review of Fecal Indicator Organisms Behavior in Ambient
Waters and Alternative Indicators for Tropical Regions”
(P32)
40



EPA’s Current Thinking on
Elements of Criteria

EPA’s Current Thinking
Agenda
• No national-scale discounting for source
anticipated
• Potential flexibilities for States
• Anticipated indicators and methods of
measurement
• Human health risks from different fecal
sources

42



No National-Scale Discounting
For Source Anticipated
• Data supporting national-scale discounting
for sources of fecal contamination have
not been identified
• Criteria will likely depend upon
epidemiology data from POTW-impacted
beaches
• A combination of sanitary survey, QMRA
and/or site-specific epidemiology studies
may provide an option for states
43

Potential Flexibilities for States
• Consideration for incorporation of new technologies
o Criteria recommendations will incorporate indicator/methods
which have demonstrated a health relationship in epi studies
o Molecular and other novel methods are evolving rapidly
o Newer evolving methods may not have been linked to health
through epi studies
o States may want to consider the use of new technologies in
water quality standards

• Consideration for Alternative Test Procedure (ATP)
o States and vendors may want to demonstrate “comparability” for
alternative qPCR methods

• EPA would provide methodologies for use in
demonstrating “equivalency” of new technologies and
“comparability” of alternative test methods

44



Approaches for Incorporation of
New Technologies
• Approaches Being Evaluated by EPA
o Comparison of results of side by side
analyses to determine if there is a predictable
relationship between the results
o States may incorporate procedures for
developing criteria values, or develop sitespecific alternatives to standards
o A description of a possible approach to
demonstrating method equivalence will be
available in parallel with the final criteria
45

Alternative Test Procedure
(ATP)
• The ATP protocol describes a series of lab tests
with which one determines comparability
between a Reference Method and a Candidate
Method.
o Establishes a definition for determining comparability
of a laboratory method result for a genetic method
ATP for microbes.
o Analytical microbiological methods are comparable if
• Same measurement technique
• Measure the same analyte

• EPA is currently developing the genetic
method ATP (Final version Dec. 2013)
46



Alternative Test Procedure
(ATP) [cont]
o Examples of comparable tests:
• two membrane filtration (MF) culture methods for Enterococci
• two MTF culture methods for Enterococci
• two qPCR methods for Enterococci that use different platforms
(instruments)

o Examples of tests that are not comparable
• a MF and a MTF culture method for Enterococci (different
determinative technique)
• a qPCR method and a RFLP method for Enterococci (both are
genetic methods, but are different determinative techniques)
• a MF method for Enterococci and a MF method for E. coli (different
analyte)
• a qPCR method and a culture method for Enterococci (different
determinative technique)
• a qPCR method for Enterococci that uses a different DNA standard
47

Tools for Development of
Site-Specific Criteria
• EPA is working to identify and develop tools
to assist with development of site-specific
criteria by states
• Would allow for development of alternative
criteria value as long as same level of risk is
achieved
• May include:
o Sanitary survey investigation and epi study
o Sanitary survey investigation and QMRA
48



Anticipated Indicators and
Methods of Measurement
• Plan to provide a combination of methods
based upon qPCR and culture
o Enterococcus qPCR and culture
o E. coli culture

• Intended to
o Provide implementation flexibility to states
o Align costs and sampling needs with purpose
of monitoring
49

Human Health Risks from
Different Sources



Human Health Risks from
Different Sources
• Recreational water epidemiology studies provide
information on the:
o Nature and extent of health effects (e.g., GI illness)
o Relative magnitude of risks (swimmer vs. non-swimmer)
o Association between the degree of fecal contamination (as
measured by FIB levels) and levels of observed illnesses in
swimmers

• These studies have not provided substantial information
about the specific microbial agents that are responsible
for the observed illnesses.
o This information is important to understand risks for a wide
variety of waterbody types and contamination sources
51

Goals of QMRA Activities
Related to Sources of Fecal
Contamination
•

Examine the human health risks from
exposure to recreational waters impacted by
different sources of fecal contamination

•

Understand which pathogens could cause
illnesses to swimmers in waters impacted by
specific sources of fecal contamination

•

Evaluate the extent to which recreational water
risks vary with the sources of contamination 52



Understanding Human Health
Risks in POTW-impacted
freshwaters
• We examined the reported epidemiologic results
from studies conducted on the Great Lakes (i.e.,
beaches impacted by treated and disinfected
effluent) in the US during 2003 and 2004 to
estimate pathogens that could have caused the
observed illnesses using QMRA.
• Soller et al. 2010. Estimating the primary
etiologic agents in recreational freshwaters
impacted by human sources of faecal
contamination. Water Research. 44:4736-4747
53

Results from QMRA in POTWimpacted freshwaters
• Relatively few pathogens appear to cause the
vast majority of illnesses.
• Human enteric viruses, and in particular
norovirus, could have caused the vast majority
of the observed swimming associated GI
illnesses during the 2003/2004 epidemiology
studies.
• The reverse QMRA is leading to a better
understanding of freshwater POTW impacted
waters.
54



Relative Risks from Various
Animal Sources
• Objective:
o Predict relative risks of illness from ingestion of
recreational water that is assumed to be
contaminated with feces from a range of animals
(human, cattle, pigs, poultry and gulls).

• Main question:
o Are the relative risks from recreation in waters
impacted by gulls, poultry, pigs, and/or cattle
substantially different than those associated with
recreational waters impacted by human sources?
55

Relative Risks from Various
Animal Sources
• Evaluated “End of Pipe” scenarios for human,
cattle, pigs, poultry and gulls.
o For human, this meant using literature reported levels
of pathogens and indicators found in treated,
disinfected effluent and raw sewage
o For cattle, pigs, poultry and gulls, this meant a ‘direct
deposition’ event using literature reported data for
pathogen and indicator levels found in their respective
feces.

• Compared predicted illness rates for human
impacted to non-human impacted waters at
“fixed” FIB levels

56



Relative Risks from Various
Animal Sources – Results

Soller et al. 2010. Estimated human health risks from exposure to recreational waters impacted by
human and non-human sources of faecal contamination. Water Research 44:4674-4691

E. Coli

57

Relative Risks from Various
Animal Sources – Conclusions
• This is an initial step to understand the relative
risks from exposure to recreational waters
impacted by gulls, poultry, swine, and/or cattle
and to compare them with POTW effluent
impacted waters
• The illness risk associated with non-sewage
impacted beaches appears to depend on the
source of contamination, i.e. some animals show
relatively lower risks than others, which could
account for the conflicting epidemiology findings
58



Limitations
 No national level non-human source exclusion
from the criteria due to limitations of available
data
• EPA will not have sufficient data to develop
different criteria values for different fecal sources
• Uncertainty involved with determining the
proportion of human fecal material that may
represent the dominant risk in a mixed-source
situation
• Uncertainty involved with evaluating the
differential disease endpoints between some
zoonotic and human pathogens (e.g., E. coli
O157:H7 versus norovirus).
