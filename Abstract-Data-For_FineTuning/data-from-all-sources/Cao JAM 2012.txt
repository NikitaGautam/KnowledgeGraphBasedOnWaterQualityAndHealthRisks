Abstract
Aims: Draft criteria for the optional use of qPCR for recreational water quality
monitoring have been published in the United States. One concern is that inhibition of the qPCR assay can lead to false-negative results and potentially inadequate public health protection. We evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for
minimizing the impact of inhibition.
Methods and Results: Five qPCR method permutations for measuring Enterococcus were challenged with 133 potentially inhibitory fresh and marine water
samples. Serial dilutions were conducted to assess Enterococcus target assay
inhibition, to which inhibition identified using four internal controls (IC) was
compared. The frequency and magnitude of inhibition varied considerably
among qPCR methods, with the permutation using an environmental master
mix performing substantially better. Fivefold dilution was also effective at
reducing inhibition in most samples (>78%). ICs were variable and somewhat
ineffective, with 54–85% agreement between ICs and serial dilution.
Conclusions: The current IC methods appear to not accurately predict Enterococcus inhibition and should be used with caution; fivefold dilution and the
use of reagents designed for environmental sample analysis (i.e. more robust
qPCR chemistry) may be preferable.
Significance and Impact of the Study: Suitable approaches for defining, detecting and reducing inhibition will improve implementation of qPCR for water
monitoring.

Introduction
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) offers
the possibility of providing results of beach water testing
within a few hours, compared with the 18–96 h
required for culture-based methods (Haugland et al.
2005; Noble et al. 2010). This speed provides the opportunity for beach managers to issue swim advisories on
the same day that water samples are collected, potentially reducing swimmer exposure to poor quality water
(Wade et al. 2008; Colford et al. 2012). As a result,

these methods are already being used by health departments in demonstration projects (Griffith and Weisberg
2011) and EPA has recently published draft Recreational
Water Quality Criteria incorporating this technology
(US EPA 2011a).
A significant hurdle to be overcome before qPCR
methods are widely implemented for water quality testing
is the inhibition of the qPCR assay by interfering substances in water samples (Dorevitch et al. 2010; Griffith
and Weisberg 2011; US EPA 2011a,b). The recently
published draft Recreational Water Quality Criteria
1



Enterococcus qPCR inhibition

recommends that ‘States evaluate qPCR performance with
respect to sample interference prior to developing new or
revised standards relying on this method for the purposes
of beach monitoring’. However, the EPA has not provided guidance about how to evaluate qPCR performance
with respect to inhibition.
Inhibition occurs when substances present in a water
sample interfere with PCR amplification, leading to target
underestimation, which can, in turn, lead to false-negative
results when applied to a beach closure scenario (i.e.
keeping a beach open that should be closed). Inhibition
can be caused by a range of physical, biological and
chemical mechanisms. While inhibition is an issue for all
qPCR methods in many application fields, there are a
number of concerns particular to recreational water quality testing. First, ambient water is compositionally complex, containing many types of potential inhibitory
substances, that is, inhibitors. Second, DNA purification,
which commonly uses commercial DNA extraction kits to
remove inhibitors, is not a simple option in this application because the added processing time leads to health
warnings being posted too late in the day to adequately
protect swimmers (Griffith and Weisberg 2011) and the
extra laboratory steps associated with commercial extraction kits can add to measurement error (Noble et al.
2010). Unpurified sample DNA is, therefore, used for the
monitoring of bacteria concentrations in beach water (US
EPA 2010).
Other options for minimizing the effect of inhibition
include dilution of the inhibitory sample (Haugland et al.
2005) and use of internal controls (Haugland et al. 2005;
Shanks et al. 2008; Noble et al. 2010). However, each of
these options has potential shortcomings. For instance,
dilution alleviates inhibition by reducing concentrations
of inhibitors, but also lowers the target concentration
potentially below detection limit. Similarly, internal controls (IC) are utilized on the premise that the IC and target assays respond to inhibitors the same way, which may
not be assumed for a given pair of reactions (Huggett
et al. 2008). Alternatively, qPCR condition such as composition of reaction mixture may be varied to increase
the robustness of an assay to inhibition.
The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of dilution, use of IC and varying qPCR conditions (composition of reaction mixtures including
alternative primer ⁄ probes) in minimizing the impact of
inhibition on applying qPCR methods for recreational
water quality monitoring. We investigated the relative
susceptibility to inhibition of five qPCR method permutations for enumerating Enterococcus for surface water quality applications, and we evaluated the effectiveness of
dilution and IC as a means of resolving or identifying
inhibition when it does occur.

Materials and methods
Approach
Inhibition was assessed for 133 samples from diverse
waters in two ways. The first was based on examining linearity of response in Enterococcus cycle threshold (Ct) values across four fivefold serial dilutions of the unpurified
sample DNA. A fivefold dilution is expected to delay the
detection of the target by 2Æ32 cycles, as 22Æ32 = 5 assuming 100% amplification efficiency (i.e. perfect doubling of
target concentration with each qPCR cycle). The sample
was deemed inhibited if the Enterococcus Ct difference
between this dilution and the next serial fivefold dilution
was one cycle less than expected without inhibition (i.e.
one cycle <2Æ32 = log25). More details on this assessment
of inhibition are available in Supporting Information. The
second was inhibition detected by the IC assays. For each
IC assay in each qPCR method, a sample was deemed
inhibited if the IC Ct in the sample increased by a threshold (3Æ0, 1Æ7 or 1Æ0 cycles) from an uninhibited reference
analysed on the same plate. The thresholds 3Æ0 and 1Æ7
were selected based on literature (as used in US EPA draft
Recreational Water Quality Criteria (US EPA 2011a)
and ⁄ or previous studies (Haugland et al. 2005; Griffith
and Weisberg 2011)). The threshold 1Æ0 was selected
because one may not expect Ct difference between an
uninhibited sample and a reference to be more than one
cycle if assuming 0Æ5 cycle variability between qPCR replicates (1Æ0 cycle = 2 · 0Æ5 cycle). For samples in which an
IC was not amplified, the maximum number of cycles
was assigned as the Ct value. All qPCRs (for samples,
standard curves, uninhibited references and no-template
controls) were run in triplicates. Data from the whole
plate were discarded and analysis redone if any no-template control was amplified. Figure 1 shows the overall
experimental design and sample processing procedure.
Samples
Sixty-one of the samples were collected from 24 marine
beach sites in Southern California between 2008 and
2010. Fifty-nine samples were collected from 15 freshwater sites in the Greater Chicago area from April through
July, 2009. Another 13 samples (storm drain water, sewage and elutriate from washing algae and sediment, or
combined sewage overflow; one from Chicago area and
12 from California) were also included as potential
sources for beach contamination and ⁄ or inhibitory substances. A flow chart for sample processing is presented
in Fig. 1. Briefly, all samples were filtered within 6 h of
collection and stored at )80C until extraction. Unpurified DNA extracts were obtained via bead beating and

Method A (US EPA 2010), with the exception of the step
at which a particular internal control was added (Fig. 1,
and described later in this manuscript). Extracts were
stored at 4C and analysed within 8 h. About 31% of the
samples had insufficient Enterococcus concentrations
(<1500 cells per 100 ml, screened by culture or qPCR
methods prior to inhibition analysis) to allow precise Ct
measurements at higher dilutions (25· and 125·). In an
effort not to exclude these samples, the unpurified DNA
extracts (400 ll) from samples with insufficient Enterococcus concentrations were spiked with genomic DNA equivalent to 1500 Enterococcus cells prior to inhibition
analysis (5 ll extract used in each 25 ll qPCR). Mixed
genomic DNA from three common Enterococcus species
(E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium ATCC 35667 and
E. casseliflavus ATCC 700327) was used for spiking.
qPCR methods
Five Enterococcus qPCR methods (Table 1) were included
in this study. The TaqRegular (i.e. EPA Method A

(Haugland et al. 2005; US EPA 2010) and ScorpionN
(Noble et al. 2010) methods were as described previously.
Three variations of the regular TaqMan method (TaqFast, TaqFastfast and TaqEnviron with either faster
cycling time or potentially more robust reaction mixture)
were also included to evaluate how differing master mixes
and thermal cycling times affected inhibition. Briefly, the
qPCR mixture (25 ll including 5 ll DNA template) for
the four TaqMan methods contained: 1· corresponding
master mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA),
0Æ2 mg ml)1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St Louis, MO),

before the analyses of samples. Reference materials were
also analysed in triplicate on each sample plate for quality
control. The reference material was purified genomic
DNA from frozen filters with Enterococcus faecalis
(ATCC29212, 1Æ57 · 106 cells per filter) as described previously (Griffith and Weisberg 2011). For environmental
water samples, unpurified DNA extracts were analysed by
each of the Enterococcus qPCR method at four fivefold
serial dilutions (undiluted, 5·, 25·, 125·) (Fig. 1).
Internal controls
Four ICs were tested in this study: Salmon testes DNA
(US EPA 2010), a plasmid DNA composite construct
(Shanks et al. 2008), and two commercially available ICs:
BioGx IAC (Cat no. 700-003; BioGX Inc., Birmingham,
AL, USA) and Super Smart Control SSC (lyophilized
beads with premixed primers ⁄ probe, Cat no. QC-DNASSC; Cepheid). For simplicity, these ICs were referred to,
in the order above, by abbreviations of their qPCR probes
or of their commercial product names, as Sketa (for salmon testes DNA), UCP (for the plasmid DNA composite
construct), IAC and SSC, respectively. Based on common
usage in practice, Sketa, IAC and SSC were evaluated in
the ScorpionN method; Sketa and UCP were tested in all
four TaqMan qPCR methods (Fig. 1). Note that, under
the current protocol (US EPA 2010), salmon testes DNA
is added prior to DNA extraction and the Sketa result is
used as a combined sample processing and inhibition
control to control for both DNA recovery and presence
of inhibition (US EPA 2010). In this study, salmon testes
DNA were added to the final reaction mixture (described
later in this manuscript), rather than before DNA extraction, such that its efficacy as an inhibition control alone
could be assessed. Additionally, although SSC is a TaqMan-based chemistry, it was included for evaluation in
ScorpionN, which uses a master mix in lyophilized bead
form (produced by Cepheid; the same company that produces SSC), in anticipation of complete dry chemistry for
4

the duplex qPCR method in the future. All IC assays were
duplex with the Enterococcus target assay, except for Sketa, which were simplex assays for all five qPCR methods.
Reaction conditions were as described previously
(Shanks et al. 2008; US EPA 2010) or per manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, for the simplex Sketa assay in all
four TaqMan methods, reaction mixtures (25 ll) contained 1· corresponding master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0Æ2 mg ml)1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma),
1 lmol l)1 of each primer, 0Æ08 lmol l)1 of TaqMan
probe (Applied Biosystems), and 0Æ04 ng ll)1 salmon testes DNA (Sigma). For the duplex UCP assay in all four
TaqMan methods, additional reagents included
0Æ08 lmol l)1 of probe for the IC and 50 copies of the
IC. For the simplex Sketa assay in the ScorpionN method,
reaction mixtures (25 ll) contained 1· OmniMix HS
(Cepheid), 0Æ25 lmol l)1 primer and 0Æ25 lmol l)1 Scorpion probe (Biosearch), and 0Æ04 ng ll)1 salmon testes
DNA (Sigma). For the duplex IAC assay, additional
reagents included 0Æ08 lmol l)1 Scorpion primer,
0Æ08 lmol l)1 Scorpion probe and 100 copies of the IAC
as specified by the manufacturer. For the duplex SSC
assay, lyophilized beads containing premixed (10·) primer, probe and IC were used in reaction set-up to
achieve a 1· concentration in the final duplex reaction
mixture.
Standard curves using reference materials (as described
previously in this manuscript) were also performed to
confirm performance of ICs and the concentration ranges
where quantification of Enterococcus and IC does not
interfere with each other. For environmental water samples, unpurified DNA extracts were analysed by the IC
assays undiluted and at 5· dilution.
Data analysis
We compared (i) directly observed inhibition (by serial
dilution) among five Enterococcus qPCR methods to assess
their robustness against inhibition; (ii) directly observed

inhibition against inhibition detected by IC within each
qPCR method to assess reliability of ICs; and (iii) directly
observed inhibition between undiluted and diluted sample
DNA, as well as inhibition detected by ICs between undiluted and diluted sample DNA, within each qPCR
method to assess how well dilution resolved these two
assessments of inhibition. The EPA method A was used
as the benchmark and the other four qPCR methods were
referred as the variant qPCR methods. An IC was considered to have missed inhibition (i.e. false negative) if it
failed to identify inhibition that had been identified using
the serial dilution approach. An IC was considered to
have given a false alarm (i.e. false positive) if it indicated
inhibition while the serial dilution approach did not.
ancova was used to compare standard curves generated by different qPCR methods and between simplex
and duplex Enterococcus assays within a qPCR method.
To define the range where competition from an Enterococcus assay did not interfere with quantification of ICs,
anova with Tukey’s HSD test was used to compare Ct
values from a fixed amount of IC in the presence of different concentrations of Enterococcus. Because a balanced
data set (i.e. the same number of uninhibited and inhibited samples for the Enterococcus target assay) is required
(Kubat et al. 1998) for adequately assessing the reliability
of IC to reflect inhibition in the Enterococcus target assay,
random sampling without replacement of the observed
results (from all analysed water samples) was performed
100 times, and the results were averaged. All statistical
analyses were performed in R ver. 2.11.1 (R Core Development Team 2011).
Results
All Enterococcus and IC assays had amplification efficiency
>1Æ90, except for UCP in some qPCR methods. For the
simplex Enterococcus assay, all qPCR methods had standard curves with comparable slopes (P > 0Æ05) but different intercepts (P < 0Æ001). Raw Ct values from ScorpionN
and TaqEnviron were approximately 2 and 1Æ5 cycles
higher, respectively, than raw Ct values from the other
three qPCR methods. Amplification efficiency of ICs was
also checked using serial dilutions of the ICs in simplex
assays. All ICs had high amplification efficiency (>1Æ95)
except for UCP, the efficiency of which varied with qPCR
method: TaqRegular (1Æ81 ± 0Æ03), TaqFast (1Æ80 ± 0Æ04),
TaqFastfast (1Æ65 ± 0Æ005) and TaqEnviron (1Æ99 ± 0Æ01).
Note that in this study, amplification efficiency is reported
as amplification factor (1–2) instead of percentage efficiency (0–100%). All standard curve equations (and R2)
are provided in Supporting Information (Table S3).

substrate competition (Hoorfar et al. 2004) between

Enterococcus qPCR inhibition

Enterococcus and IC in duplex reactions was determined
using noninhibitory reference materials. Duplexing did
not affect amplification efficiency of the Enterococcus
assays (P > 0Æ05). Duplexing also did not affect quantification of low Enterococcus concentrations with any of the
ICs, except that duplexing with SSC in the ScorpionN
method led to Enterococcus becoming undetectable at the
lowest dilution of 20 cells per filter. The Enterococcus concentration ranges where IC quantification was unaffected
varied with IC and sometimes with qPCR method. For
most ICs, the ranges were similar among qPCR methods,
ranking from the full range tested (up to 1Æ57 · 106 cells
per filter) to the narrowest (<1Æ26 · 104 cells per filter) as
follows: SSC > UCP (excluding TaqEnviron) >IAC. Interestingly, UCP quantification was unaffected throughout
the full range of Enterococcus concentrations tested when
using the TaqEnviron qPCR method. More details on the
ICs’ application ranges are provided in Supporting Information (Fig. S1).
Susceptibility to inhibition differed substantially among
the Enterococcus qPCR methods. TaqEnviron was the
most robust, with only four samples inhibited (Table 2).
TaqEnviron, TaqFast, ScorpionN and TaqFastfast were
0Æ2, 1Æ3, 2Æ0 and 3Æ0 times as likely to be inhibited, respectively, compared with TaqRegular. Susceptibility to inhibition was similar between freshwater and marine samples
for all five qPCR methods.
None of the ICs accurately reflected the presence or
absence of Enterococcus target assay inhibition for more
than 85% of the samples, and this overall accuracy varied
with the different qPCR methods and IC thresholds for
the same IC (Table 3). While ICs overall averaged 70%
agreement with inhibition detected by serial dilution, the
errors by ICs were generally unbalanced with respect to
missed inhibition (i.e. false negative) and false alarm (i.e.
false positive). Sketa and SSC appeared insensitive with
high specificity: they largely had very few false alarms, but
failed to identify about half to two-third of the inhibited
samples, except for Sketa in ScorpionN. In contrast, UCP
and IAC appeared sensitive with low specificity: they

*TaqEnviron was not included because of small number of undiluted samples (n = 4) exhibiting Enterococcus target assay inhibition.
As described in the Materials and Methods, because a balanced data set is required for adequately assessing reliability of IC in reflecting Enterococcus target assay inhibition, random sampling without replacement (n out of results from all samples) was performed to ensure n ⁄ 2 samples
were inhibited and n ⁄ 2 samples were uninhibited for the Enterococcus qPCR assays.
False negative: percentages of samples (out of n ⁄ 2) that were inhibited for Enterococcus qPCR but the inhibition was not detected by IC.
§False positive: percentages of samples (out of n ⁄ 2) that were not inhibited for Enterococcus qPCR but were flagged as inhibited by IC.
–Overall accuracy: percentage of samples (out of n) for which IC reliably reflected either the presence or the absence of inhibition on the Enterococcus assay, that is, % true positives + % true negatives.

usually gave false alarms more frequently than missed
inhibition, except for with IC threshold of 3Æ0 cycles.
In the absence of inhibition (i.e. with uninhibited reference materials), most ICs produced Ct values of 30–34
with low variability (average within-plate standard deviation ranged from 0Æ27 to 0Æ5 cycles). However, Sketa
assays produced Ct of approximately 21 (in the four TaqMan qPCR methods) or 27 (in the ScorpionN method)
with minimal variability (average within-plate standard
deviation ranged from 0Æ06 to 0Æ09 cycles). This perhaps
reflected the relative high concentration (hence smaller Ct
with low variability) of salmon testes DNA used for the
Sketa assay as this assay was typically used as a combined
sample processing and inhibition control (US EPA 2010).
Note that Sketa in the four TaqMan methods vs that in
the ScorpionN method were two different assays (based
6

on TaqMan vs Scorpion probe chemistry, respectively)
of the same internal control (i.e. salmon testes DNA),
which may explain the Sketa Ct difference above (21 vs
27). Additionally, little difference in Ct variability was
observed for a given IC across the five (Sketa) or four
(UCP) qPCR methods. Nevertheless, UCP appeared to
have more stable Ct values in TaqEnviron than in others
(Table S4).
Fivefold dilution of the unpurified and undiluted DNA
extracts resolved inhibition for 78-100% of the samples,
depending on the qPCR method (Table 4). Effectiveness
of further dilutions was not evaluated, as the 1 : 5 dilution was already effective. Additionally, assessment of
dilution effectiveness for TaqEnviron was limited because
only four samples were inhibited when undiluted. However, inhibition detected by ICs responded to the fivefold

dilution differently than did the Enterococcus target assay
inhibition. For example, the fivefold dilution resolved
95% of the true inhibition for TaqRegular (Table 4), but
only relieved <84% of the inhibition detected by UCP
(Table 5). In contrast, for TaqFastfast, the fivefold dilution was more effective on resolving inhibition detected
by Sketa (>87%) than resolving inhibition of the Enterococcus assay (79%).
Discussion
This is the first study to compare IC and directly
observed inhibition across qPCR permutations. Directly
observed inhibition was defined by qPCR detection
occurring earlier than expected following sample dilution;
qPCR permutations included assay reagents and cycling
time. We found considerable difference in susceptibility
to inhibition among the five qPCR method permutations
we tested. Reagent mixtures were important. The TaqEnviron method was the least susceptible to inhibition, with
the improved performance likely resulting from the polymerase used (in the TaqMan Environmental Master Mix
2.0, Table 1), as polymerases have been found to be differentially susceptible to various inhibitors (Abu Al-Soud
and Radstrom 1998; Eilert and Foran 2009). The bovine
serum albumin added in the four TaqMan methods has
also been considered a common PCR facilitator in the
presence of inhibitors, presumably due to its stabilizing
effect on polymerase and ⁄ or the DNA template (Kreader
1996; Wilson 1997). The TaqMan and ScorpionN methods also differed in their primers and probes, and primer-probe properties were suggested to affect inhibition
through altered annealing and extension efficiency in the
presence of inhibitors (Chung 2004).
In terms of cycling time, there appeared to be a tradeoff between speed and sensitivity to inhibitory compounds; this trade-off may need to be seriously considered to make implementation practical. Methods using a
shorter running time (TaqFast, TaqFastfast and ScorpionN; Table 1) had higher susceptibility to inhibition, possibly because more time allows the reaction to achieve

full replication at each cycle even in the presence of
inhibitors. Longer extension time has been found to
improve PCR efficiency (Wei et al. 2008). While timing is
crucial for rapid recreational water monitoring, slightly
slower but more robust qPCR methods might still allow
same day water quality warnings (Griffith and Weisberg
2011) with lower probability of qPCR results being
affected by inhibition. Additionally, inhibition can be
chronic (i.e. inhibition consistently occurs over time at
certain sites), so it maybe that the trade-off between time
and relieving inhibition need only be made at a subset of
sites. Further work is being conducted to assess robustness (against inhibition) of an even faster version (possibly < 1 h) of the TaqEnviron method (currently 1 h
33 min).
A frequent approach to mitigating inhibition is to
adjust the results based on the performance of an assay
7



Enterococcus qPCR inhibition

for exogenous DNA that serves as a control. The foundation of this approach is the assumption that the exogenous DNA assay is inhibited the same way as the target
assay (Huggett et al. 2008). Our results suggest that this
is an imperfect approach with the ICs we tested, as they
all detected inhibition inconsistently with that identified
through dilution on the Enterococcus target assays
(Table 3). Additionally, disagreement between inhibition
detected by ICs and inhibition on Enterococcus qPCR was
not resolved by simple linear offsets of IC threshold
(from 3Æ0 to 1Æ0 cycles), nor did the two assessments of
inhibition respond to fivefold dilution to the same extents
(Tables 4 and 5), further indicating inhibition on ICs and
Enterococcus were mechanistically different in the ambient
samples. While the ICs may reflect target assay inhibition
if inhibitors are affecting the polymerase alone, exogenous
DNA would likely respond to inhibitors differently than
target DNA if the inhibition effect is through inhibitor
interacting with DNA template or DNA-polymerase complex (Opel et al. 2010). In the latter case, a competitive IC
designed to share more sequence similarity with the target
DNA would be more reliable than ICs that share little
sequence similarity with the target DNA (Hoorfar et al.
2004). This may explain why UCP, which is a competitive
IC, performed slightly better than the other IC in the TaqMan methods, though only <80% of target assay inhibition was reliably reflected even by UCP. Thus, use of any
of the four ICs we tested to numerically correct for inhibition for the Enterococcus assay may not be appropriate.
Further studies with more samples from wider geographic
regions will shed additional light on this subject.
Nevertheless, the decision to use any of the four ICs we
tested for detecting inhibition for the Enterococcus assay
may be one for end users, who must decide if the frequencies of missing and ⁄ or falsely identifying inhibition
by ICs are acceptable for their research or monitoring
applications. Simulation assessing the impact of inhibition
can assist such decision-making (An example of such a
simulation is provided as Appendix S1 in Supporting
Information). Consideration of application ranges (Hoorfar et al. 2004) and preference of duplex vs simplex assays
(Shanks et al. 2008) is also needed in choosing ICs for
detecting inhibition. Although it is important to note that
different concentrations of the same IC can affect performance of the IC, the IC assays in this study were used as
optimized by the corresponding assay developer or manufacturer. Regardless, it is important that an IC is specifically evaluated for its reliability in mimicking inhibition
of the target assays.
One alternative to ICs would be assess inhibition on
the target assay itself using a spiking-followed by dilution
approach. If a DNA sample is inhibited, then the difference between Ct values of this DNA sample and its fur8

ther dilution will be smaller than expected for samples
not inhibited. However, to ensure that the diluted DNA
(if not inhibited) has enough targets to produce a reliable
Ct (low target concentration lead to high variability in
Ct), a fixed amount of reference material (i.e. that used as
standard for quantification in the given qPCR method) is
spiked into the DNA sample prior to dilution. A full protocol for conducting such an approach is provided as
Appendix S2 in Supporting Information. Because spiking
and dilution add analysis time and supply cost, this
approach may not be appropriate for routine ambient
water monitoring. Yet, it may be useful for applications
in microbial source tracking (Silkie and Nelson 2009) and
clinical diagnosis (Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. 2010) where
timing and cost may be of lesser concern and it is not
feasible to design and conduct comprehensive evaluation
of ICs for every given qPCR assay.
We also found that a fivefold dilution of the unpurified
DNA extract was effective in resolving inhibition in the
samples we tested, but this approach has drawbacks
because dilution reduces method sensitivity. The theoretical detection limit for TaqRegular is 27 cells per 100 ml
following the standard filtration and extraction protocol
(Haugland et al. 2005). Implementing a fivefold dilution
would raise the detection limit to 135 cells per 100 ml,
above the current recreational water quality criteria of
104 Enterococcus per 100 ml. Additionally, qPCR variability greatly increases when the target concentrations are
low (Whitman et al. 2010; Griffith and Weisberg 2011).
DNA amplification relies on the target coming into contact with the reactive agents (primer, polymerase etc.).
When target concentration is low, amplification becomes
stochastic resulting in higher variability in Ct values (Sivaganesan et al. 2010). Although dilution can be an effective
mechanism for reducing inhibition, the resulting low precision may be undesirable for beach management decisions unless the measured concentrations far exceed the
present concentration for public health notification. Careful characterization of study sites would help to determine strategies that minimize the impact of inhibition. In
situations where a fivefold dilution can be effective, it is
suggested to perform qPCR with both undiluted and
diluted sample DNA if one suspects high probability of
inhibition at certain monitoring sites. This will avoid
delaying production of usable qPCR results owing to the
need to dilute and reanalyse inhibited samples.
Inhibition can result from several potentially interactive
mechanisms (Opel et al. 2010), including: (i) reducing
polymerase activity; (ii) reducing availability of DNA
template for amplification through interaction of inhibitors with the DNA; and (iii) interfering with primer
extension of the polymerase-DNA complex. While most
inhibition occurs during qPCR, which is the focus of our

and most other investigations, mechanism b could also
have an effect during DNA extraction, prior to qPCR. It
is possible that inhibitors such as humic substances may
bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) during the
extraction step when dsDNA is released by cell lysis, making it unavailable for subsequent qPCR. The inhibition
assessment by dilution (this study) may account for this
type of pre-qPCR inhibition if dilution shifts the binding
equilibrium (between inhibitor and dsDNA) and frees
some dsDNA. However, as the thermodynamics for interaction between humic substances and dsDNA remain
unclear (Sutlovic et al. 2008), we consider this type of
pre-qPCR inhibition beyond the scope of our study.
Although this study focused on Enterococcus qPCR, our
findings provide useful guidance in broader applications.
We demonstrated that inhibition compatibility between
IC and target assays cannot be assumed. While a more
susceptible IC can be employed to screen samples for
inhibition for less susceptible target assays, using one IC
for identifying inhibition in multiple target qPCR assays,
or using an IC to numerically adjust qPCR results without comprehensive validation, should be discouraged.
Additionally, the spiking-followed-by-inhibition approach
(Appendix S2) can be a useful tool to detect inhibition
for a variety of qPCR applications (e.g. microbial source
tracking or clinic diagnosis) where turnaround time and
cost are of relatively lesser concern as compared to recreational water quality monitoring.
As US regulators move towards recommendation of
qPCR-based methods for Enterococcus quantification in
ambient waters, it is imperative to establish a uniform definition of inhibition and to recommend specific approaches
to mitigating inhibition. Our work suggests that the salmon
testes DNA (i.e. Sketa), which is specified in the EPA
Method A as a sample processing and inhibition internal
control, does not reliably reflect Enterococcus inhibition.
The potential impacts of using Sketa for adjusting Enterococcus qPCR results via the DDCt approach need to be comprehensively evaluated prior to routine usage. The use of
the dilution method described here, along with the use of
reagents designed for the analysis of environmental samples
may offer a more consistent and accurate approach for
identifying and mitigating qPCR assay interference.
