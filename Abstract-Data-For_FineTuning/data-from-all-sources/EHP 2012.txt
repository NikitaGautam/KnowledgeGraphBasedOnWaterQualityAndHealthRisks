Background: Wastewater-impacted waters that do not support swimming are often used for
­boating, canoeing, fishing, kayaking, and rowing. Little is known about the health risks of these
limited-contact water recreation activities.
Objectives: We evaluated the incidence of illness, severity of illness, associations between water exposure and illness, and risk of illness attributable to limited-contact water recreation on waters dominated by wastewater effluent and on waters approved for general use recreation (such as swimming).
Methods: The Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and Recreation Study was a prospective
cohort study that evaluated five health outcomes among three groups of people: those who engaged
in limited-contact water recreation on effluent-dominated waters, those who engaged in limitedcontact recreation on general-use waters, and those who engaged in non–water recreation. Data
analysis included survival analysis, logistic regression, and estimates of risk for counterfactual exposure scenarios using G-computation.
Results: Telephone follow-up data were available for 11,297 participants. With non–water recrea­
tion as the reference group, we found that limited-contact water recreation was associated with the
development of acute gastrointestinal illness in the first 3 days after water recreation at both effluentdominated waters [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.96] and
general-use waters (1.50; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.07). For every 1,000 recreators, 13.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 24.9)
and 15.1 (95% CI: 2.6, 25.7) cases of gastrointestinal illness were attributable to limited-contact
recrea­tion at effluent-dominated waters and general-use waters, respectively. Eye symptoms were
associated with use of effluent-dominated waters only (AOR 1.50; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.06). Among
water recreators, our results indicate that illness was associated with the amount of water exposure.
Conclusions: Limited-contact recreation, both on effluent-dominated waters and on waters designated for general use, was associated with an elevated risk of gastrointestinal illness.

Limited-contact water recreation activities are
popular in the United States. An estimated 71
million people participate in fishing, 52 million
in motor boating, 20.7 million in canoeing, 9.4
million in rowing, and 6.4 million in kayaking
(Cordell et al. 2004). Some waters that have
not attained the goal of the Clean Water Act
(1972) to support “recreation in and on the
water” are used for limited-contact recreation
(e.g., fishing and boating) but not full-contact
recreation (e.g., swimming and water skiing).
Recently, site-specific standards for limited
(or secondary) contact recreation have been
explored in several U.S. states for waters that
do not support full-contact recreation, generally because of high concentrations of bacteria [Illinois Pollution Control Board 2010;
Missouri Department of Natural Resources
2011; Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) 2003; Utah Department of
Environmental Quality 2008]. Large cohort
studies (Colford et al. 2007; Wade et al. 2008,
2010) have evaluated the health risks of fullcontact recreation, but little is known about the
health risks of limited-contact recreation. The
Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and
Recreation Study (CHEERS), a prospective

192

cohort study, was designed to estimate the risk
of illness attributable to limited-contact water
recreation. Additionally, we assessed the severity of illness reported by study participants.

Materials and Methods
Overview. The design and methods for the
study presented here were adapted from those
of the U.S. EPA’s National Epidemiological
and Environmental Assessment of Recreational
water (NEEAR) study (Wade et al. 2006, 2008,
2010). The CHEERS study, which was conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago
in the Chicago, Illinois, area between 2007
and 2009, included people who were engaged
in limited-contact water recreation (defined as
canoeing, fishing, kayaking, motor boating,
or rowing) and people who were engaged in
non–water recreational activities. After being
screened for eligibility, participants underwent two field interviews: a brief prerecreation
interview that collected contact information;
an interview immediately after recreation
inquired about demographics, dietary and other
exposures, symptoms at baseline, and the extent
of water exposure during recreation. Barcoded
wrist bands were applied to the wrist or ankle of
participants to ensure correct matching of data
volume

from pre- and postrecreation interviews from
individual participants. On approximately days
2, 5, and 21, the participants were contacted by
telephone and asked about exposures (including
water recreation), the development of health
symptoms, and the severity of symptoms, since
the previous interview. Computer-assisted
interviews were conducted in the field and by
telephone using Blaise version 4.7 (Statistics
Netherland; Heerlen, the Netherlands).
Setting. Participants were enrolled at
Chicago-area locations where limited-contact
water recreation takes place, including the
Chicago Area Waterways System (CAWS).
The CAWS, which includes the Chicago
River, is engineered so that urban drainage
and waste­water flow backward from Lake
Michigan toward the Mississippi River.
Two wastewater treatment plants that use an
activated sludge process but no disinfection
(such as chlorination) each discharge about
300 million gallons of treated wastewater per
day into segments of the CAWS where limited-contact recreation (but not swimming) is
permitted. Approximately 75% of the annual
flow through the CAWS originates from the
treatment plans (Rijal et al. 2011). In addition to the CAWS, recruitment took place
at inland lakes, rivers, and Lake Michigan
beaches designated by the state for swimming
and other full-contact use, referred to here as
general-use waters (GUW) [see Supplemental
Material, Figure 1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/

Health risks of limited-contact water recreation

July), geometric mean densities of E. coli and
enterococci, which were analyzed by membrane filtration, were 678 and 164 colonyforming units (CFU)/100mL on the CAWS
and 96 and 70 CFU/100 mL at the GUW
locations, respectively (Dorevitch et al. 2011a).
Detection of Giardia and adenovirus type F
was more frequent on the CAWS (86% and
65% of samples, respectively) than on the
GUW (47% and 24%, respectively) waters.
Cryptosporidium and enterovirus were each
detected in about 30% of samples at both
CAWS and GUW locations (Aslan et al. 2011;
Dorevitch et al. 2011a).
Participants. Limited-contact recreators
were enrolled into one of two water recreation
groups, CAWS or GUW, depending on
their location of recreation. People who were
engaged in non–water recreational activities at
locations adjacent to the CAWS and GUW
water access locations, including cycling,
jogging, rollerblading, team sports, and
walking, were enrolled into the unexposed
(UNX) group. People were not eligible for
enrollment in CHEERS if they had engaged
in surface-water recreation (not including pools
or water parks) within the previous 48 hr,
intended to swim during their index recreation
event, or would not be available for telephone
follow-up. People were not excluded from the
study because of unintentional swimming (e.g.,
falling into the water while kayaking). After
completing the day-21 telephone follow-up
interview, participants were allowed to re-enroll.
Recruitment took place in 2007 (August
through November), 2008 (March through
October), and 2009 (April through July).
Exposure assessment. Self-reported exposure
to recreational water was evaluated in the postrecreation interview. Participants who reported
any water contact were asked to evaluate, by
region of the body (i.e., head, face, torso, upper
extremity, and lower extremity), their degree of
water exposure. Exposure was scored as none
(0), drops (1), splash (2), drenched (3), or
submerged (4). Scores were summed by body
region (values ranged from 0 to 4), and overall
(scores ranged from 0 to 16). Water ingestion
was categorized as none, drops, teaspoon,
mouthful. The validation of the self-reported
estimates of water ingestion has been reported
previously (Dorevitch et al. 2011b).
Definitions of the five health outcomes.
Acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) was defined
as a) three episodes of diarrhea in 24 hr,
b) vomiting, c) nausea with stomachache,
d) nausea that interferes with daily activities,
or e) stomachache that interferes with daily
activities; this definition for AGI was used by
the NEEAR study (Wade et al. 2006). Acute
respiratory illness (ARI) was defined as a) fever
plus nasal congestion, b) fever plus sore throat,
or c) cough with phlegm; this definition for
ARI was used in the Mission Bay study on

swimming (Colford et al. 2007). Participants
were classified as having ear symptoms if they
reported any ear pain or ear infection; as having
eye symptoms if they reported any eye redness,
crusting, itching, or draining; and as having a
skin rash if they reported any rash. An individual who had baseline symptoms of a particular
outcome was not considered to be at risk for
that outcome but was at risk for developing
other health outcomes.
Data analysis. We identified potential
effect modifiers and confounders of associations between the exposure groups and outcomes using conceptual models based on prior
studies and principles of infectious disease epidemiology [see Supplemental Material, Table 1
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103934), for
a complete list of the variables identified]. We
determined time windows of interest for each
health outcome using survival analysis methods,
beginning with the generation of Kaplan–
Meier plots. If log-negative–log survival plots
did not identify time windows of differential
risk across study groups (i.e., time-by-group
interactions), we determined time windows of
interest based on incubation periods described
in the literature for pathogens previously identified as causes of outbreaks of recreational
waterborne illness (Dziuban et al. 2006; Yoder
et al. 2008). However, we also repeated analyses using several different time windows for
illness onset to evaluate the sensitivity of effect
estimates to the definition of time window for
each outcome.
We estimated the AORs for each outcome
using logistic regression models that included
all covariates identified in the conceptual
models as potential confounders, as well as all
potential effects modifiers (interaction terms)
that were found to be significant at p < 0.10. In
the absence of multicolinearity, covariates were
not eliminated from the models. Models of
AGI and ARI included terms for water ingestion (dichotomized as a mouthful or more
vs. less), while models of ear and eye symptoms included a term of face wetness (the eye
model also included a term for hand wetness,
because we considered hand-to-eye contact to
be a route of exposure), and skin rash included
the total dermal exposure score. Associations
between water recreation and illness were evaluated in three-group models using two indicator variables (CAWS vs. other, GUW vs.
other, with UNX as the reference category).
Differences in illness attributable to wastewater
(as opposed to other surface water) exposure
were evaluated using data from CAWS and
GUW groups only; we adjusted these models
for self-reported water exposure and specific
water recreation activities.
Attributable risk was defined as the incidence proportion in the exposed group minus
the incidence proportion in the UNX group,
which was adjusted for differences in the

120 | number 2 | February 2012

distribution of covariates between groups. These
estimates were computed using a counter­
factual exposure scenario, which implemented
the G-computation method as described by
Fleischer et al. (2010). For each health outcome, coefficients of the logistic model were
used to calculate the predicted probability
of illness of each individual, using his or her
unique values for all covariates except for the
study group. Instead of the observed group of
the participant, the counterfactual for CAWS
forced every participant’s value for group to be
CAWS, regardless of the group in which the
participant had been enrolled in the field study.
Similarly, the counterfactual for GUW and
UNX forced every participant’s value for group
to be GUW and UNX, respectively. These
predicted probabilities of illness were averaged
by group to produce a counterfactual point
estimate of risk for CAWS, GUW, and UNX.
Attributable risk differences were computed by
subtracting the average counterfactual probability of illness of one group from a comparison group. A bias-corrected 95% confidence
interval (CI) was obtained using the standard
CI (Efron and Tibshirani 1986). Using the
SURVEYSELECT procedure in SAS (version
9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), we sampled
with replacement from the study sample of
11,297 observations to obtain 1,000 bootstrap
samples of the same size as the original. For
each of these samples, the multivariate logistic models were fit, and the G-computation
method was used to calculate the risk differences between study groups. The distribution
of 1,000 bootstrap risk differences was used to
estimate standard 95% CIs around the point
estimates of attributable risk.
Additional analyses included the use of
random effects models (PROC GLIMMIX;
SAS) to evaluate whether data obtained from
individuals who participated more than once
could be considered independent of data
collected from those same individuals during prior participation in the study. We did
not perform random-effects analyses of family
units because < 5% of participants enrolled
with family members. Propensity scores were
used in the logistic models to evaluate potential
confounding that may have resulted from the
absence of randomization of participants to
study groups. Propensity score methods were
employed to match participants from different
groups according to their observed covariate
values (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Two
propensity scores, the probabilities of being in
CAWS versus UNX and GUW versus UNX,
were calculated for each participant using a
logistic model predicting the individual’s group
(CAWS vs. UNX and GUW vs. UNX) based
on the observed covariate values for the individual. Participants were then categorized into
strata according to their propensity scores,
resulting in covariate-matched individuals

in each stratum. Stratified group effects were
compared with the multivariate logistic result
that did not include propensity score strata.
All data analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.2.

1.1% were obtained from individuals who
participated more than twice. Participants were
enrolled on 390 location dates over 190 dates.
The number of participants and the distribution of their ages were similar across the three
groups (Table 1). Among the two water recreation groups, rowing and motor boating were
more common among CAWS participants,
whereas fishing and canoeing were more common among GUW participants.
Time periods of interest. In the first days
after participation in the field study, the two
water recreation groups had a higher proportion
of incidence of AGI than did the UNX group
(Figure 1), whereas starting at about day 7, AGI
occurred more frequently among the UNX.
Based on the log-negative–log survival curves,
time-by-group interactions were present for
AGI when dividing the follow-up period, for
example, for days 0–2 versus days 3–21 and
days 0–3 versus days 4–21 (i.e., the proportional
hazards assumption was not valid). Curves
for other end points did not suggest specific
time windows for exposure outcome relations
[see Supplemental Material, Figure 3A–3D
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103934)].
Therefore, time windows were chosen based
on reported incubation periods for pathogens
of concern. The time period of interest for ARI
was days 0–7, based on the incubation period
observed in recreational waterborne Legionella
outbreaks (Campese et al. 2010; Foster et al.
2006; Greig et al. 2004). For otitis externa, we
used days 0–7, consistent with a prior epidemiologic study (Springer and Shapiro 1985).
A 0- to 3-day time window of interest for skin
rash was based on prior studies of outbreaks
of cercarial dermatitis, which generally occurs
within the first 2 days of water recreation
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) 1992; Hoeffler 1977; Mulvihill and
Burnett 1990].
Incidence of illness and associations between
illness and group. The incidence proportion of
each health outcome is summarized by group
in Table 2, indicating that gastro­intestinal, eye,
and skin symptoms were more frequent than
respiratory or ear symptoms. The AOR and
CIs for associations between study group and
illness are summarized in Table 2, and complete model estimates (including AORs for
model covariates) are provided in Supplemental
Material, Tables 2A–2E (http://dx.doi.
org/10.1289/ehp.1103934). Study group was
associated with AGI incidence. For the CAWS
versus UNX comparison, the AOR was 1.46
(1.08, 1.98) and for the GUW versus UNX
comparison, 1.50 (1.09, 2.07). No association
was suggested between AGI and whether limited-contact recreation took place on effluentdominated (CAWS) versus other (GUW)
waters. The adjusted odds of eye symptoms
among CAWS participants were elevated, with
either UNX or GUW as the reference group.

Health risks of limited-contact water recreation

Two potential modifiers of associations between group and outcome were significant at the p = 0.1 level. An interaction
between age category and study group for the
incidence of ARI was suggested (p = 0.08).
Among those ≤ 10 years of age, the AOR for
developing ARI for CAWS versus UNX was
1.90 (0.67, 21.56), whereas for those ≥ 11
years of age, the AOR was 0.89 (0.56, 1.42).
An interaction between diabetes and study
group and the incidence proportion of AGI
was observed (p = 0.04); the AOR for developing AGI in the CAWS versus UNX group was
1.52 (1.12, 2.07) for those without diabetes
and 0.62 (0.19, 2.02) for those with diabetes. However, given the unstable estimates for
the two smaller groups—those < 10 years of
age with ARI (n = 13 in the CAWS + UNX
groups) and those with diabetes (n = 14 with
AGI in CAWS + UNX groups)—these health
outcomes were modeled without interaction
terms to arrive at more interpretable results.
Among those who participated in limitedcontact recreation, swallowing water was associated with the occurrence of AGI and ARI,
face wetness score was associated with ear
symptoms, and hand wetness score was associated with eye symptoms (Table 3).
Risk difference (RD) estimates based
on G-computation indicated greater risks for
both water recreation groups compared with
the UNX groups. For the CAWS and GUW
groups, the RD (95% CI) relative to the UNX
group were 13.7 (3.1, 24.9) and 15.1 (3.1,
24.9), respectively, per 1,000 recreators. No
suggestion of RD for AGI was apparent between
two water recreation groups (0.8; –9.9, 10.4)
(Table 4). Consistent with logistic regression
estimates, the RD for eye symptoms was significantly elevated for CAWS versus UNX (RD
14.3; 2.3, 24.4) but not for GUW versus UNX.
Evaluation of data analysis assumptions.
The final logistic model for AGI was re-run on
data sets that defined AGI as the occurrence
of symptoms during different time windows.
AORs for association between AGI and CAWS
group (with UNX as the reference) with 0–2,
0–4, and 0–5 days after exposure were 1.45
(1.04, 2.02), 1.23 (0.95, 1.60), and 1.18 (0.92,
1.51), respectively, whereas the estimate for the
default (0- to 3-day) time window was 1.46
(1.09, 1.96). Similar findings (higher AORs for
AGI with shorter time intervals) were noted for
the GUW group and also for the association
between CAWS recreation and eye symptoms
(data not presented). The addition of terms
for propensity score strata to the multivariate
logistic models resulted in minimal changes
(approximately 1%) in AORs, suggesting that
despite the nonrandom design, confounding
was not apparent after adjustment for model
covariates. The GLIMMIX model of AGI
demonstrated that a random-effect term for
individual participants was not significant

volume

(likelihood ratio p = 0.13), consistent with the
assumption that repeated participation events
by individuals who enrolled more than once
could be considered independent. The impact
of the definition of exposure (swallowing water
vs. head/face wetness) and degree of exposure
(none vs. other, none or drop vs. other, etc.)
on associations between study group and AGI
were evaluated. Regardless of the definition
of exposure, the AOR for group (CAWS vs.
GUW) was approximately 1.0, confirming no
difference between the adjusted odds of AGI for
CAWS and GUW groups, as summarized in
Supplemental Material, Table 3 (http://dx.doi.
org/10.1289/ehp.1103934). Last, we attempted
to run binomial models of health outcomes as

was peformed by Wade et al. (2008) in their
analyses of the NEEAR study; however, models did not converge, as may be expected for
uncommon (< 10% incidence) events (McNutt
et al. 2003; Zou 2004).
Symptom severity. Of the 431 participants
who developed AGI (including those who
developed other symptoms along with AGI),
there were no significant differences (p > 0.05)
among exposure groups in the proportion who
took over-the-counter medication or saw or
spoke with a health care provider (45.2% and
12.5% for all participants combined). However,
participants in the UNX group with AGI were
more likely to report prescription medication
use (9.4% compared with 4.3% and 4.4% in

the CAWS and GUW groups; Fisher’s exact
p = 0.002) and emergency department or hospital care [4.3% compared with 0% and 1%
for CAWS and GUW (based on six cases of
emergency department/hospital care), Fisher’s
exact p = 0.008]. Among the 383 participants
who developed eye symptoms, differences in
severity by group were not apparent. Overall,
50.9% used over-the-counter medication, 5.7%
used prescription medication, and 14.1% spoke
with or saw a health care provider.

Discussion
We observed risks of gastrointestinal illness
attributable to limited-contact water recreation
that were comparable whether the recreation
took place on effluent-dominated waters or
GUW. A risk of eye symptoms after limitedcontact water recreation on effluent-dominated
waters only was apparent. Two cohort studies,
both set on the same United Kingdom whitewater canoeing slalom course fed by wastewater, reported associations between canoeing
and the development of gastrointestinal illness (Fewtrell et al. 1992; Lee et al. 1997).
However, substantial water contact, including
capsize, occurred frequently (Lee et al. 1997),
blurring the distinction between limited- and
full-contact recreation. The risk of AGI after
swimming at Great Lakes (Wade et al. 2006,
2008) and marine beaches (Wade et al. 2010)
impacted by wastewater discharge, a marine
beach not impacted by wastewater discharge
(Colford et al. 2007), and an inland reservoir
that does not directly receive wastewater discharge (although some of its tributaries do)
have been described recently (Marion et al.
2010). Table 5 summarizes the unadjusted
incidence proportion of illness and associations between exposure group and gastrointestinal illness in these studies and CHEERS.

Caution should be used in comparing estimates
of association and risk across studies because
of differences in protocols (we interviewed
individuals rather than family units), the frequency and timing of health follow-up (days
2, 5, and 21 in CHEERS vs. a single follow-up
interview between days 8 and 14, depending
on the study), and differences in the definition of gastrointestinal illness. We identified
a relatively brief time window during which
differences among groups in the incidence proportion of AGI was maximized. It is possible
that stronger associations between illness and
swimming might have been obtained in the
earlier studies had the day 0–3 time windows
been used for defining gastrointestinal illness.
Given the above caveats, the risk of AGI
attributable to limited-contact recreation
appears to be within the range of attributable risk suggested by the above-noted studies
of swimming. The incidence of AGI attributable to limited-contact water recreation was
similar (about 14–15 cases/1,000) for the
CAWS and GUW and groups, which is counterintuitive given that the CAWS is predominantly wastewater and that Cryptosporidium
and adenovirus type F were more likely to be
detected on CAWS compared with GUW locations (Aslan et al. 2011; Dorevitch et al. 2011a).
This finding has potential policy implications,
as the incidence proportion among GUW recreators is greater than the 8/1,000 targeted risk
level at Great Lakes beaches established by the
BEACH Act of 2004 amendments to the Clean
Water Act (U.S. EPA 2004). Although CAWS
and GUW recreators were equally likely to
swallow a mouthful of water, GUW recreators
reported head/face submersion more frequently
than did CAWS recreators (2.9% vs. 0.4%;
p < 0.001). Thus, the average dose of ingested
pathogens (pathogen density per unit volume

of water × volume of water ingested) may have
been comparable for the two groups, with
CAWS recreators experiencing head immersion less frequently, but in waters with higher
pathogen densities, whereas GUW recreators
experienced head immersion more frequently,
but in waters with lower pathogen densities.
The higher incidence proportion of eye
symptoms among CAWS recreators, compared
with either users of GUW or the non–water
recreators, stands in contrast to other cohort
studies of comparable or larger size that did
not identify statistically significant associations
between swimming and eye symptoms (Colford
et al. 2007; Wade et al. 2008). Canoeing on
a whitewater slalom course in the United
Kingdom was not associated with eye symptoms (Lee et al. 1997), although that study had
less statistical power because of a sample size
that was about one-tenth of CHEERS. U.S.
recreational waterborne disease outbreaks have
identified cases of eye symptoms (Dziuban et al.
2006; Yoder et al. 2008); however, these outbreaks occurred at spas and water parks that use
disinfectants and other eye irritants. In addition
to the possibility that infectious agents in the
CAWS were responsible for symptoms, another
possibility is that endotoxin, a component of
the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, played
a role. Endotoxin has been thought to cause
a variety of symptoms, including eye symptoms, among workers in wastewater treatment
plants (Lee et al. 2007). Airborne gram-negative
bacteria have been measured in the vicinity of
one of the CAWS wastewater treatment plants
(Scheff et al. 1981), although not specifically
along the waterway.
Ambient water quality criteria have been
established based on an estimated number of
cases of illness attributable to swimming per
1,000 uses, rather than measures of association

Health risks of limited-contact water recreation

(such as odds ratios or relative risks) reported by
epidemiologic studies. To estimate illness incidence as a function of water quality, the U.S.
EPA criteria documents for fresh (U.S. EPA
1984) and marine (U.S. EPA 1983) beaches
modeled the difference in AGI between swimmers and nonswimmers at beaches based on
data collected over a season at a beach, and
more recently, based on daily measures of indicators (Wade et al. 2008). We applied a recently
described causal inference approach (Fleischer
et al. 2010). This method, which makes use of
the complete data set, may be useful in other
observational studies in which estimates of
attributable risk (defined as adjusted betweengroup differences in incidence) are desirable.
Strengths of this research include the relatively large sample size, prospective collection
of exposure data, limited loss to follow-up,
use of the same questionnaire items as previous studies, the data-driven approach to
determination of time windows of concern
for AGI, and the evaluation of illness severity.
Confounding would have been reduced had
participants been randomized to study groups,
as has been done in controlled exposure
studies (Fleisher et al. 2010) This approach
was considered but not used, because participants in organized canoeing, kayaking,
and rowing events would not have accepted
randomization to non–water recreation. The
unique aspects of the wastewater management system in Chicago, which unlike most
U.S. cities does not include disinfection, may
limit generalizability to other settings. This
publication does not include evaluations of
microbial measures of water or estimated dose
(volume of water ingested × microbe density)
as predictors of illness; these will be subjects
of future manuscripts.

Conclusions
It is generally assumed that risks of adverse
health outcomes due to limited-contact water
recreational activities such as boating, canoeing,
fishing, kayaking, and rowing are relatively low,
even on waters with high densities of microbial
pollutants. We observed an increased risk of
AGI associated with limited-contact recreation,
both on effluent-­dominated waters and on surface waters designated for full-contact use. The
absence of a difference in risk of AGI between
exposure to effluent-dominated waters and
other waters was contrary to expectations given
differences in the levels of potential pathogens.
It is possible that differences in pathogen concentrations may have been offset by higher
levels of water ingestion during recreation on
water approved for general use. The risk of
eye symptoms was elevated among those who
engaged in limited-contact recreation on effluent-dominated waters only, possibly because of
infectious agents, endotoxin, and/or irritants.

Ear, skin, and respiratory symptoms were not
associated with limited-contact recreation.
The occurrence of gastrointestinal, respiratory,
eye, and ear symptoms was strongly associated
with the degree of self-reported water exposure,
suggesting that observed associations between
water recreation and illness are causal.
