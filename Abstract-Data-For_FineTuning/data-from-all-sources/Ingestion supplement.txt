Chemicals and materials
13

C315N3 was purchased from Cambridge Isotope

10

Isotopically labeled cyanuric acid

11

Laboratories (Andover, MA). Native cyanuric acid (Alfa Aesar, 99% purity) was

12

purchased from Fisher Scientific. Also purchased from Fisher were acetic acid,

13

ammonium acetate, 99.99+% potassium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (K2HPO4), 1 N

14

sodium hydroxide (NaOH), volumetric standard 1.0 N hydrochloric acid in water, HPLC

15

grade methanol, methyl-t-butyl-ether (MTBE) and water.

16

A 24 port vacuum manifold was purchased from Restek (Cat# 26080). Sorbent

17

Hydromatrix (Cat.# 198003) and two types of Chem-Elut extraction cartridges were

18

purchased from Varian (Cat.# 12198006 and 12198004). Sep-Pak Plus C-18 cartridges

19

were purchased from Waters (Cat.# WAT020515). Millex syringe filters (0.22 micron, 13

20

mm diameter) were bought from Millipore.

21

1.2.

22

The method described by Cantu and co-workers Cantu et al. (2001a, 2001b) was adopted

23

for analysis of CYA in pool water. Briefly, about 1 mL of the pool water from each

24

sample was filtered through a Millex syringe filter into a 2-mL glass HPLC vial. Dilution

25

of the samples was found unnecessary for most samples. The standard solutions of CYA

26

in HPLC grade water were prepared with concentration ranging from 0.78 to 78 mg/L.

Analysis of CYA in urine samples

2

Urine sample pretreatment: The U.S. EPA has attempted to develop a standard method

3

for the analysis of CYA in urine (USEPA, 2003) but in contrast to pool water, well-

4

established methods do not yet exist. Most published methods for CYA analysis are for

5

foodstuffs, and many of them have been summarized by the World Health Organization

6

WHO (2008). Among the small number of peer-reviewed publications involving the

7

analysis of CYA in urine, the extraction and cleanup procedures were described more

8

than 25 year ago by Briggle et al. (1981) and Allen et al. (1982) are cumbersome and

9

difficult to implement for large number of samples. Dufour et al. (2006) and Evans et al.

10

(2006) analyzed CYA in urine samples, though neither the details of the method nor

11

evaluations of method performance have been reported. A method developed by Patel

12

and Jones (2007) uses diatomaceous earth extraction column with methyl-t-butyl-ether

13

(MTBE) elution.

14

In this work, the Sep-Pak C-18, self-packed Hydromatrix sorbent cartridge, and two

15

commercial Chem-Elut cartridges, were evaluated to optimize operational conditions.

16

The elution procedure was established using the solvent MTBE, which was then

17

evaporated to dryness. Methanol, water, and synthetic urine were compared as the final

18

solvent for re-constitution of CYA solution. As a result of the method development, a

19

protocol was developed that minimized interferences and maximized recovery. Most

20

urine samples were analyzed within 24 h. If this could not be done, 50 mL of the sample

21

was transferred to a Nalgene amber colored HDPE bottle, frozen, and then thawed prior

22

to analysis. Seven mL of urine were transferred to a Chem-Elut cartridge set on a

23

vacuum manifold. After 50 minutes the loaded Chem-Elut cartridges they were eluted

24

four times each using MTBE 15 mL, with 10 min intervals between elutions. Once the

25

elution was completed, the MTBE solvent was allowed to evaporate to dryness, the

26

solution was reconstituted in 1 mL of HPLC grade water, and sonicated in a water bath

27

for about 1 min. The aqueous solution was passed through the Millex syringe filter into a

28

2-mL glass vial for HPLC analysis.

2



1

Quantification of the CYA concentration in urine was based on external calibration. A

2

series of calibration solutions were prepared by spiking known amounts of CYA in a

3

urine sample from an individual who had no swimming pool exposure. The calibration

4

standards underwent the same laboratory procedures as the urine samples.

5

HPLC/DAD Analysis: The major analytical instrument was an Agilent Model 1100

6

HPLC system equipped with a vacuum degasser, a quaternary pump, a thermostated

7

column compartment and a diode-array UV detector (DAD). Three different types of

8

columns were compared: 1) a C-18 reverse phase column 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5µm

9

particle size (Alltech); 2) a porous graphite carbon (PGC) column, 110 mm × 3.0 mm,

10

5µm particle size (Hypercarb, Thermo-Fisher); and 3) a hydrophilic interaction (HILIC)

11

column, Zorbax Rx-Sil 2.1 mm × 150 mm, 5 µm particle size (Agilent Technologies).

12

The PGC column was selected for the analyses due to its better retention of CAY and

13

robustness than the other two columns. All field samples were injected using an

14

autosampler for 20 μL injections. The temperature of the column compartment was

15

maintained at 35°C. The mobile phase was the 5:95 (v:v) mixture of methanol and 50

16

mM phosphate buffer (pH 9.1). The HPLC was operated in an isocratic mode with a flow

17

rate of 0.8 mL/min. The wavelength of the UV detector was set at 213 nm.

18

LC/MS/MS Analysis. The procedure of urine sample pretreatment for analyzing CYA by

19

HPLC-MS/MS is similar to that described above for HPLC/DAD analysis, except that

20

100 ng/mL 13C3 15N3 labeled CYA was spiked in each urine sample as the first step. The

21

Waters MicroMass Quattro LCZ LC/MS/MS system was used for analysis. The

22

operational conditions were developed based on those previously reported Smoker and

23

Krynitsky (2008). For each sample, a 20 µL full-loop injection was made at 8 µL/min. A

24

SeQuant ZIC HILIC column (2.1×150 mm PEEK, 5 micron) was used. The mobile phase

25

was in gradient flow at mL/min with solutions B (5% 10 mM ammonium acetate: 95%

26

methanol) and C (10 mM ammonium acetate dissolved in 50:50 methanol:water). The

27

electron spray ionization MS was operated in negative mode with multiple reaction

28

mechanism (MRM). The native CYA was monitored with primary transition m/z

29

128→42 and secondary transition m/z 128→85. The labeled CYA was monitored with

30

transition m/z 134→44. Quantitation of CYA was based on integrated peak area of the
3



1

primary transition. A 5 point calibration curve was derived from four solutions with CYA

2

concentration ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 µg/mL plus the origin.

Method Performance

4

2.1

CYA in Pool Water

5

A total of 130 pool water samples were analyzed using the HPLC/DAD method. Both the

6

mean and the median of all non-zero concentration values are 20 mg/L (N = 91), with a

7

standard deviation of 17 mg/L and a range of 1.6 ~ 62 mg/L. At least one tap water

8

sample per pool per day was prepared in the field along with the pool water samples and

9

set to the lab in blinded fashion for analysis. All such field blanks were correctly

10

identified as containing no detectable CYA. All standard curves had R2 > 0.999. Two

11

spiked water samples were analyzed, with recoveries of 96.5% and 99.0%. A total of 18

12

samples were analyzed in duplicates, and the precision among duplicates was

13

characterized as the relative percent difference (RPD):

14

RPD = Absolute value of (duplicate1 – duplicate 2) / mean of duplicates × 100%

15

The average RPD was 0.03% (range 0.00 ~ 0.5%). Limits of detection (LOD) and

16

quantitation (LOQ) were determined to be 0.05 and 0.2 mg/L, which are 3 and 10 times

17

of the level represented by instrument noise, respectively.

18

2.2 CYA in Urine

19

Urine samples were collected from 665 of the 685 study participants (97.1%). However,

20

63 subjects (9% of the total) were enrolled on days that the swimming pools contained no

21

measurable CYA. This was unexpected, as pool managers had all confirmed prior to the

22

start of the study that cyanurate salts were used at the pools. Of the remaining participants,

23

eight provided urine samples of insufficient volume (see Section 2.3.1).

24

A majority of the processed urine samples were analyzed using HPLC/DAD method, due

25

to limited access to the LC/MS/MS system. The calibration curves had a mean (±standard

26

deviation) R2 of 0.996±0.004 (N = 20). The method recovery of the urine processing
4



1

procedure was calculated from ratio of the paired standard curve and the calibration curve.

2

The average method recovery, 32.7±7.1%, was consistent throughout the study period.

3

Matrix spikes had a mean (± standard deviation) recovery of 70±24% (N = 17), ranging

4

from <30% to >99%. The spike recovery tended to be higher for higher spiked

5

concentrations, suggesting the loss of CYA either during the pretreatment process or due

6

to interferences in LC/DAD analyses. Of 35 pairs of samples analyzed in duplicate, only

7

5 had detectable CYA concentrations. The relative percent difference for these five pairs

8

was 24.7±19.6 %.

2.3

Comparing HPLC/DAD and LC/MS/MS Methods

10

The correlation between MS measures of CYA and HPLC measures of CYA was

11

poor (r2=0.1) in the subset of 13 participants whose urine samples were analyzed

12

using both methods, as shown in the Table below.

Comparing Ingestion from Self-Reported and CYA HPLC/DAD Estimates

18

Water ingestion estimated from self-report was often inconsistent with estimates of

19

ingestion from HPLC measures of CYA. Of the 18 negative field control samples (urine

20

samples from the 18 people who walked around the pool), three (17%) were false

21

positives, with calculated ingestion volumes greater than 15 mL (two of whom had

22

calculated ingestion volumes greater than 40 mL). Of the 262 participants who reported
5



1

swallowing no water on days when pool CYA concentrations were at least 20 μg/mL, a

2

total of 18 (6.9%) had calculated ingestion volumes of 30 mL or more (two of whom had

3

calculated ingestion volumes of more than 100 mL). On the other hand, false negatives

4

occurred as well. Of the 16 participants who reported ingesting a mouthful or more of

5

water on days when the pool CYA concentration was at least 20 µg/mL, five (25%) had

6

CYA-based calculated ingestion volumes of 3 mL or less. These results suggest poor

7

overall performance of the analytical procedure using the non-specific HPLC/DAD

8

method. Restricting the analysis to the subset of subjects enrolled when the HPLC

9

column was relatively new had minimal impact of the consistency between self-reported

10

and CYA-based estimates of water ingestion. The major problem may result from

11

insufficient removal of the matrix substances during the cleanup step. These substances,

12

likely to be of biological origin, might have interfered with HPLC separation and UV-

13

DAD detection, causing cross contamination and inaccurate quantification.
