Sporadic Human
Cryptosporidiosis
Caused by

To investigate sporadic human cryptosporidiosis trends
in the United Kingdom, we tested 3,030 Cryptosporidium
spp.–positive fecal samples, submitted for routine typing in
2007–2008, for C. cuniculus. C. cuniculus prevalence was
1.2%; cases were mostly indigenous and occurred across
all age groups. Most occurred during August–October and
may be linked to exposure opportunities.

T

he protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium spp. are
major causes of gastrointestinal disease worldwide.
Most cases in the United Kingdom are caused by C.
parvum or C. hominis; rare infections with other species
and genotypes include C. meleagridis, C. felis, C. canis,
C. ubiquitum, C. hominis monkey, skunk, horse, and
rabbit (1–3). In summer 2008, the rabbit genotype caused
a waterborne outbreak in drinking water (4). Previously,
only 1 human infection, also identified in the United
Kingdom, was known (1), although routine typing based on
RsaI restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs)
within the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP)
gene (2) does not differentiate the rabbit genotype from C.
hominis (4). After phylogenetic and biologic investigations,
the rabbit genotype has been renamed C. cuniculus (5).
However, information is lacking about the occurrence
and epidemiology of animal and human infections outside
the outbreak, which mainly involved adult females (5–7).
To investigate trends in humans, we conducted enhanced
testing of Cryptosporidium spp.–positive fecal samples
from patients with sporadic diarrhea (submitted for routine
typing during 2007–2008) with the purpose of identifying
and characterizing C. cuniculus.

The Study
Archived DNA from all samples received for typing
during January 2007–December 2008 that showed C.
hominis COWP PCR-RFLP RsaI profiles were retested by
single-round small subunit (SSU) rRNA PCR-RFLP using
SspI, which generates a pattern unique to C. cuniculus (4).
An exception occurred during the outbreak period (July and
August 2008) when all Cryptosporidium spp.–positive stool
samples were tested by a pan-genus nested PCR specific for
the SSU rRNA gene and products digested with SspI and
VspI (4). Although differentiating more species/genotypes
than the COWP PCR-RFLP (7), this assay is unsustainable
for typing large numbers of samples on a routine basis. C.
cuniculus was confirmed by sequencing ≈830 bp of the
SSU rRNA gene and ≈850 bp of the 60-kDa glycoprotein
(GP60) gene by using nested PCR protocols (4).
Data were analyzed in Epi Info version 6 (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, GA, USA).
Incomplete data for Northern Ireland were excluded, but
no C. cuniculus cases were identified there. Case-patients
with sporadic C. cuniculus, C. parvum, and C. hominis
infections were compared by age using the Mann-Whitney
2-sample test, by sex using the Mantel-Haenszel version
of the χ2 test, by month of specimen submission, and by
Government Office Region (England and Wales) or Health
Board (Scotland) of the primary diagnostic laboratory.
In total, 37 (1.2%) of 3,030 infections were caused by C.
cuniculus: 23 in 2007 and 14 in 2008 (online Appendix Table,
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/17/3/536-appT.htm). Twentyfive were in patients from England and Wales, and 12
patients were from Scotland. Other cryptosporidia detected
were C. parvum (n = 1,506, 49.7%), C. hominis (n = 1,383,
45.6%), C. meleagridis (n = 26), C. felis (n = 8), cervine
genotype (n = 8), co-infection C. hominis and C. parvum
(n = 5), novel or unidentified genotypes (n = 5), and C.
hominis monkey genotype (n = 1); 88 did not amplify with
the PCR primers. Substitution of routine typing with the
SSU rRNA nested PCR-RFLP during the outbreak did not
increase the number of “unusual” cryptosporidia, apart
from C. cuniculus, indicating the routine COWP PCRRFLP is otherwise appropriate for typing for epidemiologic
purposes in the United Kingdom.
The age range of patients with sporadic C. cuniculus
infection was 1–74 years (mean 29 years; median 31
years), significantly older than C. hominis case-patients
(range 0–83 years; mean 19 years; median 13 years)
(Mann-Whitney 2-sample test value = 11.12, df = 1, p =
0.0009) and C. parvum case-patients (range 0–86 years;
mean 17 years; median 29 years) (Mann-Whitney 2-sample
test value = 15.24, df = 1, p = 0.00009) (Figure 1). The
sex distribution was 14 (37%) female and 22 (58%) male
patients, with the sex of 1 patient not known, compared with
sporadic C. parvum (781 [51.9%] female) and C. hominis

(736 [53.2%] female) cases, although the difference was
not significant (χ2 = 4.01, df = 2, p = 0.13).
More C. cuniculus cases were detected in the late
summer and autumn than in the winter and spring, similar
to infections with C. hominis but not C. parvum (Figure
2). Three C. cuniculus cases were identified in the East
Midlands, the outbreak affected region, but none were
found in Northamptonshire, the outbreak-affected area.
Most cases (24%) were in the Eastern region of England.
Two case-patients had traveled outside the UK, one to
Spain and the other destination not known, during the
incubation period.
Occupational and environmental exposure data were
available for 14 C. cuniculus case-patients from patient
questionnaires administered by local Environmental Health
Departments. No occupational risks were linked to rabbits.
One patient (a 9-year-old boy) reported direct contact with
rabbits (a pet), and 2 patients had potential environmental
contact (a 63-year-old woman played golf, and a 36-yearold man sat on grass during a walking holiday). Two casepatients reported diarrhea in other residential contacts.
None of the patients reported links with (lived in, had
visited or received visitors from) the outbreak-affected
area. Available clinical details were insufficient for all
cryptosporidiosis case-patients for comparative purposes.
One C. cuniculus case-patient was an immunosuppressed
child who had received a kidney transplant.
Two GP60 subtype families, Va (n = 18) and Vb (n
= 19), were detected in sporadic C. cuniculus isolates,
linked to patient sex; 10/14 (71.4%) female patients had
Va subtype, compared with 7/22 (31.8%) male patients
(χ2 = 5.24, df = 1, p = 0.022). No significant difference
in age or regional distribution was found, but cases with
Va occurred only in August through December, while Vb
cases occurred all year but mostly in August (Figure 2).

Conclusions
C. cuniculus was first identified as a human pathogen
during a waterborne outbreak, and its epidemiology has now
been described for sporadic cases in the United Kingdom.
Although the numbers are small, and the data need to be
interpreted with caution, it was the third most commonly
identified Cryptosporidium species in patients with diarrhea
during the study period, after C. parvum and C. hominis.
All C. cuniculus isolates identified by PCR-RFLP were
confirmed by sequence analysis, indicating the reliability
of the test algorithm used, although the development of
specific probes will enhance testing capability. All ages
were infected with little age delimitation <50 years, after
which numbers declined. Contrast this to C. parvum
and C. hominis, which are both linked to young age. C.
cuniculus distribution is seasonal, peaking in August
through November, and differences in seasonal distribution
of GP60 subtypes were marked.
Rabbits are the natural hosts for C. cuniculus (5),
and seasonal distribution and variation in humans may
reflect rabbit breeding seasons and infections, although
good epidemiologic studies of Cryptosporidium spp. in
wild rabbits are lacking (7). Studies of farmed and wild
rabbits so far indicate that GP60 subtype Vb predominates
(7–9), although the outbreak was caused by Va (4). Unlike
with C. hominis, seasonal distribution of cases was not
linked to foreign travel. The C. cuniculus outbreak had
occurred in July when few sporadic cases were detected.
The distribution of sporadic cases was the opposite of
the outbreak in which more case-patients were female
(6). The association between GP60 subtypes and patient
sex is intriguing. A small number of case-patients had
possible exposure risks, although this requires further

investigation. The only known hosts of C. cuniculus are
humans and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
(5,7–9), and until population-based studies of rabbits are
undertaken, the risks cannot be fully evaluated, nor the
human epidemiology fully explained.
