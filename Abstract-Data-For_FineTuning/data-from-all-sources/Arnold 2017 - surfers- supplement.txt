Web Appendix 1. Statistical details
Analyses were pre-specified through the Open Science Framework (see repository for
pre-registered analysis plan along with full replication files: ​https://osf.io/hvn7s​). We defined
incident episodes as the onset of symptoms preceded by ≥6 symptom-free days to increase the
likelihood that separate episodes represented distinct infections ​(1,2)​. We treated an individual’s
first 6 days of follow-up time as “at risk” under the assumption that the individual did not have
incident illness in the days immediately before the start of their recorded symptom history. We
calculated incidence rates by dividing incident episodes by person-days in unexposed and
exposed periods during follow-up. If participants missed weekly surveys during follow-up, we
did not include those periods in the analysis. We measured the association between ocean
exposure and subsequent illness using an incidence rate ratio (IRR). Let ​Yit be a binary indicator
equal to 1 if individual ​i is ill on day ​t (0 otherwise), let ​Tit be an indicator that participant ​i is at
risk of illness on day ​t. Let ​Eit be a binary indicator of equal to 1 if individual ​i entered the ocean
on day ​t (0 otherwise). Define ​E*it = max(​Ei,t-1 , …, Ei,t-3), which is a binary indicator of whether
the individual entered the ocean in the three days prior to the outcome measurement on day ​t.
Our first parameter of interest was the IRR associated with ocean exposure in the past three days
(​E* = 1), averaged over potentially confounding covariates (​X). We modeled illness for
individual ​i on day​ t using the following log-linear rate model ​(3)​, subset to days at risk (​Tit = 1):
log E[​Yit | ​E*it , Xit] = ​α + βE*it + γ Xit

5

(1)



where ​Xit is a vector of potential confounders included in adjusted analyses (details below). We
estimated the IRR associated with ocean exposure from the model, exp(​β), and used robust
standard errors that accounted for repeated observations within individuals ​(4)​.
Our second research question examined whether ocean exposure increased illness rates
more if exposure took place within three days of wet weather compared with exposure during
dry weather. Let ​Dt be a count of days since it rained >0.25 cm in 24 hours, with ​Dt = {0, 1, 2,
…}. Let ​Rit be a binary indicator equal to 1 if individual ​i entered the ocean on day ​t and ​Dt ≤ 3
(0 otherwise), indicating that a surf session took place within three days of rain. Define ​R*it =
max(​Ri,t-1 , Ri,t-2 , Ri,t-3), a binary indicator of whether an individual had a wet weather exposure in
the past three days.​ With ​E*it ​ (an indicator of any ocean exposure in the past three days), we
created a three level categorical exposure:

We estimated a log-linear model, subset to days at risk (​Tit = 1):
log E[​Yit | ​Wit , Xit] = ​α + β1I(Wit=dry)​ + β2I(Wit=wet)​ + γ Xit

(2)

where ​Xit are covariates in adjusted models. We estimated separate IRRs from the model for surf
exposure during dry versus unexposed periods, exp(​β1), for surf exposure during wet versus
unexposed periods, exp(​β2), and for wet versus dry periods, exp(​β2 - ​β1). For each outcome, we
calculated a test of trend in the IRRs for dry and wet weather exposures (not pre-specified), in
which the test for log-linear trend in incidence rates was significant if the coefficient ​β2 differed
from zero ​(5)​.
6



We estimated the association between fecal indicator bacteria levels and illness using the
subset of surf sessions matched to water quality indicator measurements at the sentinel beaches
using log​10​ continuous indicator levels, ​Fit . For surfers with a single day of exposure matched to
indicator levels in the past three days, ​Fit equaled the daily geometric mean value on the exposed
day. For surfers with multiple exposures matched to indicator levels in the past three days, we
calculated the mean concentration weighted by the number of hours spent in the water on each
day. We modeled the relationship between indicator levels and illness for individual ​i on day​ t
using a log-linear model, subset to days at risk (​Tit = 1):
log E[​Yit | ​Fit , Xit] = ​α + δFit + γ X​it

(3)

where exp(​δ) estimates the IRR associated with a 1-log​10​ increase in indicator level. We also
estimated the IRR associated with values above versus below USEPA ​Enterococcus regulatory
guidelines ​(6)​ by replacing ​Fit in equations 3 and 4 with an indicator equal to 1 if ​Fit exceeded 35
CFU/100ml or, in a second definition, if any single sample on the exposure day exceeded 104
CFU/100ml. In the water quality analysis, we also hypothesized that the relationship between
fecal indicator bacteria and illness could be modified by whether it was dry or wet weather
exposure. We allowed the exposure-response relationship to vary by exposure during dry and
wet weather by including an indicator for wet weather exposure in the past three days, ​R*it , and
an interaction term in the model:
log E[​Yit | ​Fit , W*it , Xit] = ​α + δ1Fit + δ2R*it+ δ3Fit R*it+ γ X​it

(4)

Potential confounders​: We selected potential confounders that could be either a cause of
seawater exposure, a cause of illness, or both ​(7)​. We controlled for the following time-invariant

7



potential confounders measured at enrollment: age, sex, education, employment status,
household income, years the individual had surfed, reported behavior of typically avoiding the
ocean following wet weather, surfboard length, mode of enrollment (beach vs. web), and chronic
health conditions included only for the corresponding outcomes: ear problems, sinus problems,
gastrointestinal conditions, respiratory conditions, skin conditions. We also controlled for
time-varying potential confounders: entered the ocean for an activity other than surfing, any
illness symptoms in the week preceding the risk window, day of recall, day of the week, and
rainfall total during the past three days. In the adjusted overall seawater exposure analysis and
water quality analysis we considered an indicator of wet weather in the past three days; in the
water quality analysis we also considered an indicator for sentinel beach and an indicator for
whether the individual surfed at beaches other than our two sentinel beaches in the same
three-day period as their sentinel beach exposure. From this set of potential confounders, we
retained those that had a univariate association with the outcome, defined as a likelihood ratio
test ​P-value <0.20 in an unadjusted model. For categorical variables, we included a “missing”
category for missing values.

Web Appendix 2. Power and sample size calculations
The sample size for the study was developed in two stages because little was known
about outcome or exposure prevalence in the surfer population. In year 1, we aimed to enroll
100-200 surfers and follow them for up to 12 weeks to collect exposure and illness information,
as well as fecal indicator bacteria levels. Using exposure and outcome information from the
initial, smaller cohort in year 1, we then calculated sample size and power for the full study and
this informed enrollment targets for year 2.
During the first year of the study, we enrolled 162 individuals and observed 12 incident
cases of gastrointestinal illness from 2,310 days at risk -- an incidence rate of 5 episodes per
1,000 person-days. We used a standard sample size equation for the comparison of two incidence
rates ​(8)​: ​y = (​zα/2 + zβ)​2​ (​λ0 + λ1) / (​λ0 - λ1)​2​, where ​y is the number of person-days required in
each exposure category, ​zα/2 and​ zβ are standard normal distribution values corresponding to
upper tail probability values ​α/2 and ​β (we set ​α=0.05 and ​β=0.2), and ​λ0 and​ λ1 are incidence
rates in the unexposed and exposed periods. Assuming a rate of 5 episodes per 1,000 person-days
during unexposed periods (​λ0=0.005), the Table below summarizes the number of person-days of
observation in each exposure group required to detect different magnitudes of effect, as
measured by the incidence rate ratio (IRR).
In year 1 of the study, 55% of the days of observation were exposed because surfers
entered the ocean frequently. However, only 13% of the days of observation were classified as
wet weather exposure because it was a drought year.

9



Given this, we expected that a total of 2,408 / 0.13 = 18,520 person-days of observation would
be sufficient to detect an IRR of 1.50 or greater in wet weather exposed versus unexposed
periods.

For associations between log​10​ ​Enterococcus and incident illness we used a
simulation-based approach ​(9)​. The simulation resampled the empirical distribution of water
quality measurements from year 1 for 200 surfers with different lengths of follow-up and
calculated a predicted probability of incident gastrointestinal illness on each day using the rate in
the unexposed periods from year 1 and an increased rate following exposure that corresponded to
different effect sizes. For a given strength of association (IRR), we then increased the length of
follow-up until >80% of the 1,000 simulations had a ​P<0.05 (equivalent to ​α=0.05 and ​β=0.2).
Simulations showed that 3,000 days of follow-up matched to water quality indicator
measurements at sentinel beaches would provide >80% power to estimate an IRR of 1.75 or
greater for a log​10​ increase in ​Enterococcus levels.

Web Appendix 3. Conversion of incidence rates into cumulative
incidence
The longitudinal design with varying lengths of follow-up and varying exposure periods
meant that the natural measure of illness was incidence rates (episodes / person-days) ​(3)​.
However, federal water quality guidelines and quantitative microbial risk assessment models
measure illness in units of cumulative incidence or “risk” (episodes / person) for gastrointestinal
illness ​(6)​. We converted marginally adjusted incidence rate estimates from log-linear models
described above into 3-day cumulative incidence using the density method ​(10)​. We compared
cumulative incidence during dry and wet weather exposure periods to unexposed periods using
the difference in cumulative incidence (“risk difference” [RD]), and estimated standard errors
and 95% confidence intervals for the RD using the delta method ​(11)​. We used a 3-day
cumulative incidence because incidence rates were measured over 3-day periods following
exposure -- the high frequency of exposure made longer follow-up periods infeasible. In
California swimmer cohorts, the majority of excess cases of gastrointestinal illness occurred in
the 1-2 days following ocean exposure; for this reason, a 3-day RD should be a reasonable
approximation of the RD calculated over a longer 10-12 day period, as measured in past
swimmer cohort studies ​(12–14)​.

11



Web Appendix 4. Sensitivity analyses
The primary analysis defined wet weather exposure as periods within 0-3 days following
rainfall, consistent with current beach posting guidelines in California that warn recreators to
avoid water contact for 72 hours after rainfall. In a sensitivity analysis we changed the length of
the wet weather window in daily increments from 0 to 5 days following rainfall to determine if
shorter windows were associated with larger increase in illness rates.
The technical report associated with this study (​https://osf.io/hvn7s​) includes additional
sensitivity analyses. First, we stratified incidence rates by storm size. We found evidence for
higher incidence rates associated with ocean exposure following larger storms compared with
smaller storms, but the analysis relied upon relatively small sample sizes with the higher level of
wet weather stratification and therefore should be viewed as supportive but exploratory. Second,
we examined the effect of excluding individuals from the analysis who submitted >1 survey per
day (to reduce potential measurement bias) or who did not report the precise location of their
ocean exposure (to reduce potential exposure misclassification). Excluding these subgroups of
the population from the analysis did not change our inference.

12



Web Appendix 5. Negative control exposure analyses
We matched fecal indicator bacteria levels (​Enterococcus, fecal coliforms, total
coliforms) measured at one of the sentinel beaches to illness measurements by date, randomly
assigning either the Ocean Beach value or the Tourmaline Surfing Park value to each matched
observation. We then excluded from the dataset observations that were within five days of any
seawater exposure. The negative control exposure analysis was designed to ensure that the
person-time included could not plausibly be influenced by pathogens in seawater, but could be
influenced by unmeasured sources of confounding -- such as seasonal epidemics of enteric
pathogens like norovirus.
We estimated the association between fecal indicator bacteria levels and incident illness,
allowing the association to vary by dry and wet weather exposure by including an interaction
term between the indicator levels and a wet weather period indicator, as in the main analysis. In
this negative control exposure analysis, there should be no plausible relationship between fecal
indicator bacteria levels and subsequent illness unless there is bias from unobserved confounding
or measurement error ​(15,16)​.

13



Web Appendix 6. Comparison of gastrointestinal illness rates with
summer cohorts
To help contextualize the gastrointestinal illness rates measured in this study we
completed a supplemental analysis to more directly compare illness rates with those measured in
summer swimmer cohorts. The present study used a different design that past recreational
swimmer cohorts conducted in California ​(12–14,17,18)​. Past swimmer cohorts enrolled
beachgoers and then measured cumulative incident illness over 10-12 days after their single
exposure. Such measurement was infeasible among surfers because of their frequent exposure
(median of 2 times per week). For this reason, the present study estimated daily incidence rates
during unexposed and exposed periods of follow-up -- the most natural measure of disease given
the design. This difference in design and measure of illness complicates direct comparisons of
illness between this study and past swimmer cohorts. A second difference in design that
complicates direct comparison is that the present study limited enrollment to adults, whereas past
swimmer cohorts included many children who have higher rates of gastrointestinal illness ​(18)​.
We had access to participant data from four California swimmer cohorts ​(18)​, and this
enabled us to derive estimates of gastrointestinal illness rates from the past studies that were
more comparable to those estimated in the surfer cohort. We subset the four California cohorts
(Avalon, Doheny, Malibu, Mission Bay) to adults (18 years or older) and calculated incidence
rates over the first 3 days of follow-up -- a period after exposure comparable to the present study.
We calculated incidence rates separately for non-swimmers (individuals with no water contact)
and swimmers with head immersion exposure. We compared these gastrointestinal incidence
rates with rates among surfers during unexposed and exposed periods in the present study.

Web Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis of wet weather exposure period definition on illness
incidence rates among surfers in San Diego, CA (2013-14 and 2014-15 winters). Wet
weather was defined as >0.25 cm of rain in 24 hours. Incidence rates for dry and wet
weather were re-calculated for varying lengths of wet weather window. The primary
analysis used a period of 0-3 days.



Web Table 3: Incidence rate ratios (IRR) associated with fecal indicator bacteria among surfers exposed at
Tourmaline Surfing Park and Ocean Beach in San Diego, CA (2013-14 and 2014-15 winters). The IRR is associated
with either a log10 increase in indicator bacteria (Enterococcus , fecal coliforms, total coliforms), or exposure above
versus below Enterococcus regulatory guidelines of 35 or 104 colony forming units (CFU) per 100/ml

wet weather periods, predicted from a log-linear model among surfers at Tourmaline Surfing Park
and Ocean Beach, San Diego, CA (2013-14 and 2014-15 winters). Wet weather was defined as
>0.25 cm of rain in 24 hours. Dashed lines indicate model-based 95% confidence intervals and
histograms show the distribution of Enterococcus exposure in the population during dry and wet
weather periods.

Unexposed / Non−swimmers

Web Figure 7: Incidence rates of gastrointestinal (GI) illness per 1,000 person-days in
the present study (denoted SHS) and four previous summer swimmer cohort studies
conducted in California. Swimmer cohorts were limited to adults (18 years or older) and
swimmers included those with head immersion exposure. Rates in the present study are
presented overall (dry and wet weather periods) and stratified by dry and wet weather.
Vertical lines mark 95% confidence intervals. Horizontal dashed lines mark the present
study rates to facilitate comparison with other estimates. Mission Bay = Mission Bay, San
Diego [1]; Avalon = Avalon beach, Catalina island [2]; Doheny = Doheny State Beach [3];
Malibu = Malibu Surfrider State Beach [4].
