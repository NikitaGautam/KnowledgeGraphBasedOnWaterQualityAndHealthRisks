Introduction: Advances in molecular methods provide new opportunities for directly measuring pathogens or host-associated markers of fecal pollution instead of relying on fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)
alone for beach water quality monitoring. Adoption of new indicators depends on identifying relationships between either the presence or concentration of the indicators and illness among swimmers. Here
we present results from three epidemiologic studies in which a broad range of bacterial and viral indicators of fecal contamination were measured simultaneously by either culture or molecular methods
along with Enterococcus to assess whether they provide better health risk prediction than current microbial indicators of recreational water quality.
Methods: We conducted prospective cohort studies at three California beaches – Avalon Bay (Avalon),
Doheny State Beach (Doheny), Surfrider State Beach (Malibu) – during the summers of 2007, 2008 and
2009. The studies enrolled 10,785 swimmers across the beaches and recorded each swimmer's water
exposure. Water and sand samples were collected several times per day at multiple locations at each
beach and analyzed for up to 41 target indicators using 67 different methodologies. Interviewers contacted participants by phone 10e14 days later and recorded symptoms of gastrointestinal illness
occurring after their beach visit. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between water
quality indicators and gastrointestinal illness among swimmers at each beach.
Results: Fþ coliphage (measured using EPA Method 1602) exhibited a stronger association with GI illness
than did EPA Method 1600 at the two beaches where it was measured, while a molecular method, Fþ
RNA Coliphage Genotype II, was the only indicator signiﬁcantly associated with GI illness at Malibu.
MRSA, a known pathogen, had the strongest association with GI illness of any microbe measured at
Avalon. There were two methods targeting human-associated fecal anaerobic bacteria that were more
strongly associated with GI illness than EPA Method 1600, but only at Avalon. No indicator combinations
consistently had a higher odds ratio than EPA Method 1600, but one composite indicator, based on the
number of pathogens detected at a beach, was signiﬁcantly associated with gastrointestinal illness at
both Avalon and Doheny when freshwater ﬂow was high.
Discussion: While EPA Method1600 performed adequately at two beaches based on its consistency of
association with gastrointestinal illness and the precision of its estimated associations, Fþ coliphage
measured by EPA Method 1602 had a stronger association with GI illness under high risk conditions at
the two beaches where it was measured. One indicator, Fþ Coliphage Genotype II was the only indicator
signiﬁcantly associated with GI illness at Malibu. Several indicators, particularly those targeting human
associated bacteria, exhibited relationships with GI illness that were equal to or greater than that of EPA
Method 1600 at Avalon, which has a focused human fecal source. Our results suggest that site-speciﬁc
conditions at each beach determine which indicator or indicators best predict GI illness.

bacteria (FIB) that serve as surrogates for the diverse array of
pathogens with which they co-occur in human and animal fecal
material. FIB are used because they are more easily measured than
pathogens or host-associated bacteria, many of which are obligate
anaerobes that can't be easily cultured in typical water quality
laboratories. Moreover, FIB are more abundant in fecal material
than are pathogens, increasing the likelihood of detection. The
most widely-used FIB are Escherichia coli and Enterococcus (Noble
et al. 2003), which have gained acceptance in health warning systems because of their demonstrated relationship to risk of illness
(Wade et al., 2003).
The use of FIB as surrogates is based on the assumption that
their density is correlated with that of pathogens, though a number
of studies have found this is not always true (Noble and Fuhrman,
2001; Anderson et al., 2005; Harwood et al., 2005; McQuaig
et al., 2012). There are several factors that attenuate this correlation (Byappanahalli et al., 2012), including differential decay rates
for pathogens and FIB in the ambient environment. FIB have even
been found to persist and grow in the environment (Desmarais
et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2007; Yamahara et al., 2012), while most
pathogens do not, further altering relative density between pathogens and FIB. Additionally, FIB can originate from non-human
fecal material, in which the pathogen to FIB ratio differs from that
in humans (Ervin et al., 2013).
Advances in molecular methods now allow direct measurement of microbial properties without the need for culture (Noble
and Weisberg, 2005), providing an opportunity to measure many
alternative indicators, including pathogens, some of which are
either difﬁcult to culture or cannot be cultured in the laboratory.
While molecular tools allow their measurement, inclusion of new
microbial indicators in health warning systems depends on
establishing a relationship between concentration and health
response of swimmers, which is necessary for two reasons. First,
molecular methods measure the presence of microbial properties, such as DNA or RNA coding for a particular gene, not
necessarily the viability of the bacterium or virus (Walters et al.,
2009). Thus, there is a need to establish that new indicators
measured by molecular methods are equal or better predictors of
health risk than are existing indicators. Second, a health risk
relationship is necessary to establish indicator concentrations
associated with unacceptable incremental health risk, which
determines the levels at which swimmer advisories are issued.
Here we present results from three epidemiologic studies in
which a series of alternative indicators were measured simultaneously with Enterococcus measured by EPA Method 1600 to
assess whether they provide a better predictor of health risk.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and outcome measurement
The study was conducted at three California beaches, Doheny
State Beach in Dana Point (Doheny), Avalon Bay Beach in Avalon
(Avalon) and Surfrider State Beach in Malibu (Malibu), during the
summers of 2007e2009. Detailed site descriptions, interview
procedures, sampling methods and laboratory measurement
techniques for traditional indicators can be found in Colford et al.
(2012), Converse et al. (2012), Arnold et al. (2013) and Yau et al.
(2014). In brief, the studies used a prospective cohort design. Participants were recruited each sampling day with their present
health and extent of water contact recorded. On the same day,
water samples were collected at multiple times and locations to
capture swimmer exposure. Ten to 14 days later interviewers
contacted participants by phone and recorded illness occurring
after their swimming event. Regression models were used to

evaluate the association between water quality indicators and
subsequent gastrointestinal illness among swimmers.
While the original studies measured multiple health outcomes,
including gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatologic symptoms,
and non-speciﬁc symptoms, the present analyses focus on
Gastrointestinal Illness, deﬁned as: i) diarrhea; or ii) vomiting; or
iii) nausea and stomach cramps; or iv) nausea and missed daily
activities due to gastrointestinal illness, or (v) stomach cramps and
missed daily activities due to gastrointestinal illness (identical to
“GI illness” deﬁned in Wade et al. 2010). The analyses focus on a
single health outcome due to the large number of water quality
indicators considered and the consideration of this outcome when
setting recent national guidelines for recreational water quality
(EPA 2012). To ensure that individuals were at risk of a new episode
of illness, we included in the analysis only swimmers who did not
report at the time of enrollment any gastrointestinal illness
symptom in the 72 h before their beach visit.
2.2. Water sample collection, analyses
All three beaches were sampled three times per day, with the
ﬁrst sample taken to align with the time water samples are typically
taken during routine monitoring. The timing of later sampling
events varied by beach and was tailored to when water exposures
occurred. At Doheny, water samples were collected at 5 sites at
8:00, 12:00, and 15:00 during the summers of 2007 and 2008
(Colford et al., 2012). At Avalon, water samples were collected at 3
sites in the harbor at 8:00, 12:00, and 15:00 during the summers for
2007 and 2008 (Arnold et al., 2013). A fourth site outside Avalon
Harbor was sampled only at 8:00 for control purposes (Yau et al.,
2014). At Malibu, water samples were collected at 4 sites at 8:00
and 13:00. In all cases, water samples were collected in sterilized
buckets at a depth of 0.5 m on an incoming wave and transported to
an on-site laboratory located within 1 km of the beach. For most
molecular methods water samples were ﬁltered immediately, with
ﬁlters ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80  C until
analysis. For phage, water was stored at 4  C and shipped overnight
to the processing laboratory. When large volume ﬁltrations were
required, as was the case with certain methods for bacteria and
human viruses, samples were processed and stored as described in
Love et al. (2014) (human viruses) and Hamilton et al. (2010) (E. coli
toxin genes). Table 1 provides a list of the indicators measured at
each beach and references to the methods of analysis.
2.3. Composite indicators
In addition to examining the health risk relationship for each of
the measured indicators, we also examined the same for three
types of indicator composites. The ﬁrst type (EnteroPlus) combined
Enterococcus and human fecal-associated markers, with the rationale that FIB associated with a human source would be more likely
to be associated with human pathogens than FIB from other sources. The EnteroPlus combination indicators were either geomean or
log10 of the maximum of the contributing indicators, as deﬁned by
the equations in Table 2.
The second group combined multiple measures using a model
that relied on binary results from many indicators, rather than the
traditional model based on magnitude of a single type of FIB. This
group included detection score, calculated as the number of indicators detected above the method detection limit, and hit scores,
calculated as the number of indicators with a concentration more
than ten times the detection limit. The indicators used for this
approach are described in Table 3.
The third type was ordination score, which was a composite
score generated by correspondence analysis, which is a

multivariate ordination method (ter Braak, 1995). This composite
score is the weighted average of all the contributing indicators for
each beach (Table 3), generated by a reciprocal averaging algorithm
typically employed in correspondence analysis (conducted in
software Primer v6). Prior to performing the ordination, all indicator results were normalized to span the same range of 0e100.
Continuous indicator results were divided by the maximum values
of the indicator then multiplied by 100. Binary indicator results
(such as end point PCR) were converted from presence and absence
to 0 and 100, respectively (Clarke and Warwick, 2001).
2.4. Indicator exposure assignment to swimmers
Consistent with the primary analyses from the original studies
(Colford et al., 2012; Arnold et al. 2013; Yau et al. 2014), water
quality indicator results were matched to swimmers based on the
day and location of swimming using a site-speciﬁc daily average
measure. We examined the distributions of quantitative indicator
measurements and found that in all cases the distributions were
highly right skewed. For this reason, we conducted the analysis on
log10 transformed values. For quantitative indicators, this meant
that all samples collected for a given site on each day were averaged
on the log10 scale and the mean log10 value was assigned to
swimmers who spent time in the water near that site. For presence/
absence indicators, this meant that if the indicator had a positive

result at any time during the day at that sampling site, then the
daily value would be equal to “positive.”
2.5. Statistical analysis
Our parameter of interest in the analysis was the relative risk
associated with the detection of an organism (for presence/absence
indicators) or the relative risk associated with a 1-log10 increase in
indicator concentration (for quantitative indicators). Additionally,
we calculated the relative risk associated with an interquartile
range change – equal to the difference between the 75th and the
25th percentile – separately for each indicator within each beach to
facilitate comparison of results between indicators that might
range over very different scales as a measure of robustness of our
results (see Supplemental material). We estimated the relative risk
using an adjusted odds ratio (OR) from a logistic regression model
similar to that used in previous studies (Arnold et al. 2013; Colford
et al. 2007, 2012; Wade et al., 2006, Wade et al. 2010):
ln[p/(1  p)] ¼ a þ bI þ gX

(1)

where p is the probability of the outcome, I is either an indicator
variable representing the detection of an indicator (for presence/
absence indicators) or is the log10 measured concentration of the
indicator (for quantitative indicators), and X is a vector of covariates

considered to be potential confounders (study year, age, sex, race,
swimming on multiple days, allergy status, contact with animals,
contact with sick persons, frequency of beach visits, digging in
sand, and consumption of raw or undercooked meat or eggs). Race
was categorized as white or nonwhite. A backwards deletion,
change in estimate algorithm, was used in order to retain only
potential confounders that changed the fully adjusted OR by at least
5% (relative change) when the confounder was removed from the
model (Rothman et al. 2008). We used the exponentiated coefﬁcient exp(b) from the model to estimate the OR. For quantitative
indicators, the OR estimates the relative risk of gastrointestinal
illness associated with a 1-log10 increase in the water quality indicator, and does not strictly imply a reference group. For dichotomous (presence/absence) indicators, the OR estimates the relative
risk associated with the detection of the indicator, where the
implied reference group is the subset of swimmers who entered the
water when the indicator was not detected.
As described in detail in previous articles (Colford et al. 2012;
Yau et al. 2014), environmental conditions at Doheny and Avalon
beaches were found to modify the association between indicators
and gastrointestinal illness among swimmers. We accounted for
this potential effect modiﬁcation in the present analysis of additional water quality indicators. Speciﬁcally, we allowed the association between water quality indicators and swimmer
gastrointestinal illness to be different depending on whether
freshwater ﬂowed freely into the ocean versus when a sand berm
blocked freshwater ﬂow (Doheny, Malibu), and depending on
whether modeled groundwater ﬂow was above versus below the
median (Avalon). We considered sand berm open conditions
(Doheny, Malibu) and above median groundwater ﬂow (Avalon)
“high risk” conditions in the present analyses. We extended the
analysis across all days included in the study by re-estimating the
regression model speciﬁed above, with the addition of indicators
for the high risk conditions and an interaction term between the
water quality indicator of interest and the dichotomous effect
modiﬁer (E):
ln[p/(1  p)] ¼ a þ b1I þ b2E þ b3I*E þ gX

(2)

Using the model, we estimated the association between the
water quality indicators and gastrointestinal illness separately for
low risk conditions [OR ¼ exp(b1)] and high risk conditions
[OR ¼ exp(b1 þ b3)]. For both models, we estimated standard errors
on the coefﬁcients using a robust, sandwich estimator that allowed
for correlated outcomes at the household level (Freedman, 2006).
We estimated nominal 95% conﬁdence intervals around point estimates and did not conduct formal statistical testing for differences
in the strength of association between different indicators, as the
number of pair-wise tests would have been extremely large.
Instead, any comparisons between individual indicators focused
primarily on the magnitude of the association (OR) with respect to
Enterococcus measured by EPA 1600, which was consistent with the
exploratory nature of the study.
3. Results
Fþ coliphage measured by EPA Method 1602 had a stronger
association with health outcomes than did EPA Method 1600 at
Doheny and Avalon, the two beaches where it was measured. In the
all-conditions combined analysis the OR for Fþ coliphage at
Doheny was 1.9, whereas the OR for Enterococcus was 1.2, but
neither met the 95% conﬁdence level for being statistically significantly different from 1 (Fig. 3). Likewise at Avalon, the OR for Fþ
coliphage was 1.9 compared to less than 1.1 for Enterococcus,
though neither was signiﬁcantly different than 1.0. Under high-risk

375

conditions, Fþ coliphage was signiﬁcant at Doheny and its estimated OR more than double that for Enterococcus at both Avalon
and Doheny (Fig. 1). Only Fþ RNA Coliphage Genotype II was statistically signiﬁcantly associated with gastrointestinal illness at
Malibu, although the relationship was not signiﬁcant under highrisk conditions (Figs. 1e4).
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterium
responsible for difﬁcult-to-treat infections in humans, had an OR
that was signiﬁcant and several times higher than that for EPA
Method 1600 under all conditions (OR ¼ 3.49 95% CI 1.35, 9.06) and
nearly signiﬁcant under high risk conditions (OR ¼ 3.07 95% CI 0.97,
9.64) at Avalon (Fig. 3). However, other S. aureus measures did not
outperform EPA Method 1600 at Avalon, nor did measures of
methicillin-resistant strains outperform EPA Method 1600 at the
other two beaches. There were also two presence absence methods
targeting human-associated fecal anaerobic bacteria (HF134 and
B. stericoris) that had a stronger association with gastrointestinal
illness than EPA Method 1600, but only at Avalon.
None of the composite indicators had consistently stronger
OR estimates than EPA Method 1600, but several had greater
precision than EPA Method 1600. The detection score indicator
(detscore), in particular, had the greatest precision among all
indicators and was consistently associated with a small increase
in risk of gastrointestinal illness at Avalon (OR ¼ 1.07 95% CI 0.95,
1.21), Doheny (OR ¼ 1.14 95% CI 0.98, 1.32), and Malibu
(OR ¼ 1.04 95% CI 0.90, 1.20).
4. Discussion
There were several indicator methods, particularly those targeting coliphage, that performed well at a subset of beaches based
on strength and precision of their association with gastrointestinal
illness, but no one method performed better than EPA Method 1600
across all beaches and most did not perform as well at any beach.
There are many possible reasons why measures of pathogens did
not perform as well, one being that most are present at a much
lower density in human sewage than Enterococcus; which is
particularly true for viruses. This problem of low pathogen density
is exacerbated by the low recovery rates typically recorded for viral
measures (Harwood et al., 2013). Whereas EPA Method 1600 is
prone to false positive signals from non-fecal sources (Yamahara
et al., 2012), a concern with pathogens is that they are prone to
false negatives. With the 100 ml sample volumes collected in
typical beach monitoring programs, the absence of pathogens in
the sample does not necessarily equate to their absence in the
ambient waters. Even with the larger volumes of water collected for
viral analysis during these studies, which ranged from 500 mL to
40 L, the detection rate for speciﬁc human viruses was not frequent
enough (see McQuaig et al., 2012; Love et al., 2014) to calculate a
correlative relationship with swimmer illness.
The lesser performance of the human bacterial source markers
cannot be attributed to low density, as they occur in fecal material
at densities similar to that of Enterococcus (Ervin et al., 2013). It is
possible that error in the exposure attenuated indicator associations with GI illness (Fleisher, 1990; Hutcheon et al., 2010), but the
poor performance of these indicators more likely results from
their higher decay rate in the ambient environment. Humanassociated fecal markers mainly target the order Bacteroidales,
which are strict anaerobes that do not grow or even survive for
extended periods under aerobic conditions. Further, Enterococcus
are Gram-positive cocci with peptidoglycan reinforced cell walls,
while the human-associated markers lack the same cell wall and
are more susceptible to osmotic and temperature stress. Moreover, bacterial grazers preferentially avoid ingesting grampositive cocci, likely because their cell wall is more difﬁcult to

digest (Iriberri et al., 1994).
One indicator that outperformed EPA Method 1600 at the two
beaches at which it was measured was Fþ coliphage, as measured
by EPA Method 1602. Fþ coliphage are viruses that infect E. coli and
are thought to better mimic the behavior of human viruses, which
are the primary etiologic agents in the environment, than do fecal
indicator bacteria. This is particularly likely in this study because the

fecal source at these two beaches was determined to be faulty
sanitary sewer infrastructure that allowed microbial contamination
to reach the beach via groundwater (Boehm et al., 2003; Layton
et al., 2015). In this case, viruses transported via groundwater may
more easily exﬁltrate to bathing waters than do the much larger
bacteria, which are more effectively ﬁltered out by soil and sand.
This is also consistent with an association between Fþ coliphage and

adenovirus observed at Doheny Beach (Love et al., 2014).
While Fþ coliphage measured by EPA Method 1602 outperformed EPA Method 1600 for Enterococcus, Fþ coliphage
measured using EPA Method 1601 did not perform as well. Method
1601 uses an enrichment step and is more sensitive at detecting
coliphage than is Method 1602 (Rodriguez et al., 2012), as evidenced by our greater number of samples with detectable results.
However, Fþ coliphage detected by the enrichment method has
been shown in previous studies to be less representative of the
coliphage community in the original water sample (Stewart-Pullaro
et al., 2006), possibly due to differential growth rates, which may
help to explain why there was no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between GI illness and EPA Method 1601. This is consistent
with the phage-typing results from this study, where there was a
statistically signiﬁcant relationship between GI illness and Type II
Fþ RNA coliphage at Malibu. It is also consistent with Grifﬁth et al.'s
(2009) ﬁnding of lesser speciﬁcity to sewage for the enrichment
method. It is also of note that somatic (F) coliphage did not
perform as well as Fþ coliphage, which has the additional advantage of being amenable to typing analyses, allowing limited differentiation between human and animal sources of contamination
(Love and Sobsey, 2007).
While EPA Method 1600 was consistently associated with
gastrointestinal illness at both Avalon and Doheny beaches under
high risk conditions, several non-quantitative indicators targeting fecal anaerobic bacteria of the order Bacteroidales, performed
as well or better at Avalon. This may be due to leaking sewage
lines at Avalon producing a more focused human fecal source.
This is also consistent with Enterococcus serving as a broader
surrogate for mixed sources. When the contamination source is
primarily human fecal material, indicators that target human
fecal material work better.
While this study represents the most comprehensive epidemiologic evaluation of alternate recreational water quality indicator

associations with gastrointestinal illness, several authors have
previously evaluated a subset of the indicators examined here and
our results are consistent with those previous studies. Wade et al.
(2006) examined general Bacteroidales in an epidemiologic study
of a Great Lakes sewage-affected beach and found neither a signiﬁcant health risk relationship nor a higher odds ratio than for
Enterococcus. Sinigalliano et al. (2010) had a similar lack of success
with Bacteroidales and several other source-associated markers at
a Florida beach. Colford et al. (2007) also had poor success with
general Bacteroidales at a nonpoint-source contaminated California
beach and found that viruses were not detected often enough to
develop a health risk relationship. However, Colford et al. (2007)
did ﬁnd a marginally signiﬁcant health risk relationship for Fþ
coliphage (OR for diarrhea ¼ 1.1, 95% CI 0.97e1.4).
Two of the composite indicators yielded an OR as good or better
than EPA Method 1600, but only at Avalon under high-risk conditions. The detection score (detscore) also had a more precise OR and
provides a different conceptual foundation upon which future indicator development could be based. The detection score is based
on the presence/absence of multiple indicators rather than on the
magnitude of a single indicator. This concept has the potential to
move past the shortcomings of measuring only Enterococcus by
measuring taxa that are more closely related to illness, while
avoiding the density-based challenges of looking for individual
pathogens. While the performance of composite indicators was not
as good as EPA Method 1600 alone in this study, indicator combinations have been found to be effective in beach water quality
management (Johnston et al., 2013) and our ﬁndings may reﬂect
that we were measuring only a small subset of possible markers
that could be included in such a community-based approach. Many
other potential human-associated markers are still being discovered (Cao et al., 2013; Dubinsky et al., 2012; McLellan et al., 2013)
and next generation sequencing technology enables unprecedented comprehensive characterization of fecal sources (Shanks

indicators. With the cost reduction for sequencing and bioinformatics advancement, such microbial community analysis provides
a potential strategy for improving upon the present FIB health risk
relationship.

5. Conclusions
 Fþ Coliphage was more strongly associated with GI illness than
Enterococcus at all three study sites, while human-associated
fecal bacterial markers were only predictive of illness at the
site known to be impacted by human sewage from faulty
infrastructure.
