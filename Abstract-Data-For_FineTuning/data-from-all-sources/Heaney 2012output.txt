Background: Beach sand can harbor fecal indicator organisms and
pathogens, but enteric illness risk associated with sand contact
remains unclear.
Methods: In 2007, visitors at 2 recreational marine beaches were
asked on the day of their visit about sand contact. Ten to 12 days
later, participants answered questions about health symptoms since
the visit. F⫹ coliphage, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, fecal Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in wet sand were measured using
culture and molecular methods.
Results: We analyzed 144 wet sand samples and completed 4999
interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were computed, comparing
those in the highest tertile of fecal indicator exposure with those who
reported no sand contact. Among those digging in sand compared
with those not digging in sand, a molecular measure of Enterococcus
spp. (calibrator cell equivalents/g) in sand was positively associated
with gastrointestinal (GI) illness (aOR ⫽ 2.0 关95% confidence
interval (CI) ⫽ 1.2–3.2兴) and diarrhea (2.4 关1.4 – 4.2兴). Among those
buried in sand, point estimates were greater for GI illness (3.3
关1.3–7.9兴) and diarrhea (4.9 关1.8 –13兴). Positive associations were
also observed for culture-based Enterococcus (colony-forming
units/g) with GI illness (aOR digging ⫽ 1.7 关1.1–2.7兴) and diarrhea

(2.1 关1.3–3.4兴). Associations were not found among nonswimmers
with sand exposure.
Conclusions: We observed a positive relationship between sandcontact activities and enteric illness as a function of concentrations
of fecal microbial pollution in beach sand.
(Epidemiology 2012;23: 95–106)

H

igh densities of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and
other microbial indicators of fecal pollution are present
in beach sand, sometimes in higher concentrations than in
nearby bathing waters.1– 6 Halliday and Gast7 reviewed studies that measured densities of E. coli and Enterococcus—
fecal indicator bacteria used to indicate the degree of fecal
contamination at recreational beaches across the United
States—and found that fecal indicator bacteria density in sand
was 2 to 38 times higher than in water. Fecal indicator
bacteria such as E. coli and Enterococcus indicate the potential presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Although the
density of E. coli and Enterococcus in water has been shown
to predict gastrointestinal (GI) illness among swimmers,8 the
illness risks associated with fecal pollution in beach sand
remain unclear. Whitman et al9 demonstrated potential for
hand-to-mouth transfer and exposure to E. coli and the fecal
indicator virus F⫹ coliphage (MS2) among persons in contact
with beach sand at a Chicago, IL, beach. In addition to fecal
indicator organisms, enteric pathogens have been detected in
beach sand.4,10 –14 Factors influencing the level of fecal contamination of beach sands are numerous; these may include
publicly owned treatment-works discharges in close proximity to beaches,15,16 nonpoint sources such as agricultural and
urban runoff, warm-blooded domestic and wild animals,
bathers,3,4,17 and potential regrowth of autochthonous E. coli
and Enterococcus in sand.18,19
The occurrence of fecal indicator organisms in sand has
led to questions about whether beach sand can transmit illness
associated with fecal contamination—a matter of increasing
concern to beach managers, public health officials, and
beachgoers. Despite knowledge of the presence of fecal
indicator organisms and pathogens in beach sand, doseresponse relationships between fecal indicator densities in

sand and specific illnesses have not been well characterized.
Because the beach-going public may spend more time on the
beach than in the water, and because young children typically
spend time at the water’s edge playing in sand, it is important
to understand the relation of fecal indicator densities in sand
with the risk of enteric illness.
Using data from beachgoers participating in the 2007
trials of the National Epidemiological and Environmental
Assessment of Recreational water study,20 –22 we explored
whether increased daily average estimate of fecal indicator
organisms (F⫹ coliphage, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, fecal
Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp.) in wet sand were associated with an increased risk of enteric illness among beachgoers engaged in sand-contact activities.

METHODS
Study Design/Participant Sampling
The National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational Water Study evaluated microbial
water quality and followed cohorts of visitors to freshwater
and marine beaches in the United States. The data collection
methods have been described previously.20 –22 In brief, we
interviewed beachgoers as they arrived and as they were
leaving the beach regarding their contact with beach sand,
swimming behaviors, and other beach activities. Ten to 12
days later, one adult in the household was interviewed by
telephone about symptoms experienced by participating
household members. Because of the acute nature and short
duration of illnesses considered during this study, reenrollment in the study was allowed 28 days after a previous
enrollment.

Beach Descriptions
Two recreational marine beach sites with a nearby
publicly owned treatment-works outfall were chosen for the
2007 studies. Fairhope Municipal Park Beach is located on
Mobile Bay in Fairhope, Alabama, and Goddard Memorial
State Park Beach is located on Greenwich Bay near Warwick,
Rhode Island. These beaches had publicly owned treatmentworks discharges within 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of the beach
location.

Beach Sand Collection and Analysis
Wet beach sand samples were collected at 8:00 AM
along with water samples each day of the study. Sand samples were collected using a 2.25-inch diameter stainless steel
soil auger at a distance of 1 meter perpendicular to the lowest
point of the water level (when the waves receded to their
lowest point on the shoreline) at the same 3 sampling points
where water samples were collected on each beach. No dry
sand samples were collected. Sampling points were located at
least 60 m apart to encompass the length of the beach. Beach
sand samples were tested for fecal indicator bacteria Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, fecal Bacteroides (which targets the
96 | www.epidem.com

most common human Bacteroides spp.), and Clostridium spp.
using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) calibrator cell equivalent method.23–26 Culture-based tests of Enterococcus were performed by local laboratories within 6 hours
of collection following EPA Method 160027 with some modifications (eAppendix 1, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A532). Samples for the F⫹ coliphage analysis were sent on ice at 4°C by
overnight express and processed by a modification28 of EPA
Method 160129 to accommodate the analysis of sand instead of
water samples (eAppendix 1, http://links.lww.com/EDE/A532).
Fecal indicator organism concentrations are reported as qPCR
calibrator cell equivalents per gram of dry weight sand for
Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, fecal Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. Calibrator cell equivalents were calculated according to
the comparative delta-delta cycle threshold method reported by
Wade et al.20 Enterococcus measured by EPA Method 160027
are reported in colony-forming units per gram of dry weight
sand, and F⫹ coliphage as a most probable number per gram of
dry weight sand following a modification28 of Method 1601.29
Results below detection and potential inhibition for qPCR-based
data were handled as described previously.20

Definition of Sand Contact
On leaving the beach, participants reported whether
they had dug in the sand or built sand castles (digging in the
sand), or had their body buried in the sand during their beach
visit. Participants also reported whether they got sand in their
mouth, ate or drank after playing in the sand, and washed
their hands before eating or drinking after playing in sand.
Participants were asked to report whether they had contact
with wet or dry sand. In addition to sand exposures on the day
of enrollment, participants reported other beach activities
such as any water contact (swimming), or eating raw meat,
runny eggs, or shellfish in the 3 days before enrollment.

Health Assessment
Ten to twelve days following the beach visit, participants were contacted by phone and asked if they had experienced any physical symptoms of enteric illness since the
day of enrollment. The GI illness definition followed previously published research on waterborne illness20,30 and was
considered as any of the following: diarrhea (ⱖ3 loose stools
in a 24-hour period), vomiting, nausea and stomach ache, and
nausea or stomach ache plus interference with regular activities (missed time from work or school, or missed regular
activities as a result of the illness). Diarrhea was also considered as a separate outcome. In addition, participants were
asked about activities since the enrollment-day interview,
including number of times they went to the same beach, went
swimming at another beach, went swimming in a pool, or ate
raw or undercooked foods (eg, red meat, fish, shellfish, eggs).

covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, swimming status, and beach)
were included in analyses. Participants with prevalent enteric
illness at enrollment were excluded from follow-up analyses.
Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for enteric illness (GI
illness, diarrhea) and associations with beach sand-contact activities and densities of fecal indicators in beach sand.
Measurements of fecal indicator organism densities in
beach sand were log10 transformed. Fecal indicator organism
samples below the lower detection limit were assigned a
value of one-half the lower detection limit and subsequently
log10 transformed. We analyzed the daily average of the three
8:00 AM sand samples collected on each beach as a reflection
of sand quality each day of the study.
Because a large proportion of F⫹ coliphage data was
below the detection limit, we considered only categorical
classifications involving simple presence/absence and above

Fecal Indicators in Beach Sand and Risk of Enteric Illness

versus below the median concentration (most probable number/g). For fecal indicator bacteria, we evaluated categorical
classifications of above versus below the median, as well as
tertiles (colony-forming units/g; calibrator cell equivalents/
g). Categorical models involved comparisons of those in
contact with sand on days when a fecal indicator was present
at a specific average density (eg, highest tertile) with those
who were not in contact with sand (did not dig; were not
buried in sand). For these models, the adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) can be interpreted as the risk (odds) of enteric illness
(GI illness; diarrhea) among those who dug in the sand on
days when average sand quality was at a specific level (eg,
highest tertile) divided by the risk of enteric illness among
those who did not have contact with sand. Tests of linear
trend were completed by the ranks of each categorical fecal
indicator exposure variable in a logistic regression model as
a linear term.

To evaluate the impact of multiple fecal indicators in
sand, we created an index variable defined as the number of
fecal indicators present in sand at each of the 3 sample
locations. The potential range of this fecal indicator index
variable was from 0 to 18 and was examined in tertiles. This
variable was created as an alternative method to describe the
burden of fecal contamination in the sand.
Robust variance estimates were used to account for the
nonindependence of observations within household.31,32 We
considered covariates strongly associated with beach sand
contact and illness, or those regarded by investigators to be
potential confounding factors, for inclusion in regression
models. Information on other covariates was collected for the
larger study (eg, contact with animals, contact with other
persons with diarrhea, number of other visits to the beach,
asthma, chronic GI illnesses, eating any food or drink while
at the beach, eating raw or undercooked meats, shellfish, and
fish). If there was a substantial difference between fully
adjusted and reduced model results, we used a backward
elimination approach. For each analysis, the set of covariates
was reduced through a change-in-estimate procedure.33 Adjusted odds ratio (full 关aORfull兴 and reduced 关aORreduced兴)

values were compared by using the formula: ln aORfull/
aORreduced ⫻ 100. A criterion of 5% change was used; results
from fully adjusted models are presented if the reduced model
resulted in a change in estimate of greater than 5%. At a
minimum, age, sex, race/ethnicity, swimming (defined as any
contact with water which includes wading, body immersion,
head immersion, and swallowing water), and beach were
included in all models. Data management was completed
using SAS version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and
statistical analyses were completed using Stata version 11
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

RESULTS
A total of 7041 beachgoers were offered enrollment. Of
these, 1280 (18%) declined to participate. Of those who
agreed to participate, 4999 (87%) completed the telephone
interview 10 to 12 days after visiting the beach and were
eligible for analysis. Of these interviews, 4948 (99%) respondents provided complete information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, contact with beach sand, and any swimming.
Respondents at the 2 beaches differed by age, race/
ethnicity (defined as white/nonwhite), miles traveled to the

beach, and proportion of persons who reported contact with
sand (Table 1). Overall, respondents were 64% white and
57% female, with a median age of 30 years. Factors associated with sand contact have been described previously.34
Similar to previous observations,34 those who dug in the sand
were younger than those who did not (median age, 10 and 36
years, respectively), but at baseline, similar proportions of
both groups reported vomiting and other GI symptoms (Table
1). Digging in the sand was strongly associated with swimming, as 81% of swimmers reported digging in the sand
compared with only 19% of nonswimmers. This large difference in the proportion of persons who swam was also seen for
those buried and not buried in the sand (Table 1). Participants
at Fairhope Beach were more likely to have reported digging
in the sand (766/2015; 38%) and being buried in the sand
(5%) (Table 1).
The frequency of detection and densities of fecal indicators in sand at Fairhope Beach and Goddard Beach are summarized in eAppendix 2 (http://links.lww.com/EDE/A533). The
detection of fecal indicators in sand ranged from 100% for

qPCR-based Clostridium spp. to 87% for qPCR-based Enterococcus, 72% for culture-based Enterococcus, 68% for qPCRbased fecal Bacteroides spp., 53% for qPCR-based Bacteroidales, and 17% for culture-based F⫹ coliphage (eAppendix 2).
We did not observe spatial variability in fecal indicator measures
in sand.

Relationships Among Sand Contact, Measures
of Fecal Indicators in Sand, and Enteric Illness
The incidence of GI illness and diarrhea was 6.3% and
4.2%, respectively, during the 10 –12-day follow-up period. GI
illness and diarrhea incidence was highest among children
younger than 5 years (9.5% and 5.2%, respectively) and lowest
among those aged 55 and older (5.5% and 4.3%, respectively).
Because there were few days when F⫹ coliphage was
present in sand (17% of samples positive), we examined only
presence versus absence and above versus below the median
value of samples with results above the detection limit (Table
2). There was no increase in risk of GI illness or diarrhea
among those digging in sand when F⫹ coliphage was

present (Table 2). Among those buried in sand, 14% (7/50)
had diarrhea when F⫹ coliphage was present compared
with 4% (130/3709) among those who were not buried in
sand, and there was some evidence of an increasing trend
of aORs across exposure categories (Table 2). However,
due to small numbers of cases, overall results were not
suggestive of a consistent association of F⫹ coliphage with
the sand exposures considered and GI illness and diarrhea
(Table 2).
Enterococcus measured by Method 1600 (colony-forming units/g) showed positive associations with GI illness and
diarrhea among those digging in the sand, and associations
among those buried in the sand were stronger. Compared
with people who did not dig in sand, the aORs of illness
among people who reported digging in sand with Enterococcus levels in the highest tertile were 1.74 (95% CI ⫽ 1.11–
2.72) for GI illness and 2.07 (95% CI ⫽ 1.27–3.38) for
diarrhea (Table 3). Similar associations (but less precise)
were observed for GI illness and diarrhea among people
buried in sand (Table 3). There was a trend of increasing risk

for Enterococcus colony-forming units/g in sand (assessed as
above vs. below the median or in tertiles) with enteric
illnesses among both sand-exposure groups; however, the
increase in aORs was not monotonic (Table 3).
Enterococcus measured in sand by a rapid molecular
method (calibrator cell equivalents/g) was also associated
with GI illness and diarrhea (Table 4). The aORs of illness
among people who reported digging in sand with Enterococcus in the highest tertile were 1.98 (1.23–3.19) for GI illness
and 2.44 (1.41– 4.22) for diarrhea compared with people who
did not dig in sand (Table 4). The aORs of GI illness and
diarrhea among people buried in sand with the highest tertile
of Enterococcus were 3.25 (1.33–7.92) and 4.90 (1.79 –13.4),
respectively, compared with people who reported not being
buried in sand (Table 4). The lower precision of aORs for
being buried in the sand reflects smaller numbers of participants with that exposure. There was a trend of increasing
Enterococcus calibrator cell equivalents/g in sand (above vs.
below the median and tertiles) with both enteric illnesses
among both sand-exposure groups (Table 4).

Positive associations were observed between Bacteroidales with GI illness and diarrhea for each of the sand exposures
(Table 5). Positive associations were observed between Bacteroidales and diarrhea for the above versus below the median for
both digging in the sand (1.86 关1.14 –3.05兴) and being buried in
sand (3.44 关1.31–9.04兴). Positive associations of Bacteroidales
tertiles with diarrhea were also observed for both sand-contact
groups, although numbers of events in some Bacteroidales
tertiles were small (Table 5). There was a trend of increasing
Bacteroidales calibrator cell equivalents/g in sand (above vs.
below the median and tertiles) with diarrhea, among both sandexposure groups (Table 5).
We observed less consistent relationships of fecal Bacteroides with illness among both sand-contact groups (Table
6). With one exception, all comparisons of fecal Bacteroides
in sand at densities above the median value showed smaller
aORs than for densities below the median value (Table 6).
Adjusted ORs for fecal Bacteroides tended to be higher in the
middle than in the highest tertiles (Table 6).

We also observed inconsistent relationships of Clostridium spp. estimates (calibrator cell equivalents/g) in sand
with GI illness and diarrhea among both sand-contact groups
(Table 7). Overall, categorical comparisons of Clostridium
spp. density (median and tertiles) showed smaller point estimates at the higher Clostridium spp. density categories compared with lower density categories (Table 7).
A composite index variable suggested that a larger
number of fecal indicators in sand was positively associated
with GI illness and diarrhea. There was some evidence of an
increasing trend of aORs across fecal-index tertiles, particularly for digging in sand and diarrhea (Table 8).
The fecal indicator-enteric illness associations were also
present among the subset of people who reported getting sand in
their mouth. Among this group, 16% (14/90) had GI illness
symptoms when Enterococcus (measured as calibrator cell
equivalents/g) was in the highest tertile compared with 6%
(242/4074) among those who did not get sand in their mouth
(data not shown); the aOR was 2.53 (95% CI ⫽ 1.27–5.04).

DISCUSSION
Estimates of fecal contamination in wet sand measured
by molecular methods (Enterococcus and Bacteroidales) and
culture-based methods (Enterococcus) were positively associated with enteric illness among those digging in sand and
being buried in sand at 2 recreational beach sites. This
association was observed for a definition of enteric illness
based on composite symptoms (GI illness) and a more narrow
definition (diarrhea alone). Although there was some evidence of positive associations between sand-contact activities
and enteric illness for culture-based F⫹ coliphage and molecular fecal Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. estimates,
there was inconsistency across the exposure classifications
considered (above vs. below the median and tertiles). Our
ability to make conclusions for the F⫹ coliphage measure was
limited because of its low frequency of detection in beach
sand samples (17%).
This is one of the first studies to show an association
between beach sand contact and enteric illness as a function
of microbial sand quality. One previous study observed a
relationship between sand contact and GI illness, but expo102 | www.epidem.com

sure was assessed as a function of time spent in contact with
wet sand, not as a function of an objective measure of
microbial sand quality.5 Two other studies of beach sand
exposure and health effects (which included objective measures of beach sand fecal indicator densities) did not show
consistent relationships between fecal contamination in beach
sand, sand-contact activities, and illness (including GI illness).35,36 Another study,34 which lacked objective measures
of fecal contamination of sand, observed an increased risk of
enteric illness associated with beach sand-contact activities
(digging in sand and being buried in sand).
Investigators have observed manyfold higher concentrations of fecal microbial indicators (including E. coli and
Enterococcus) in beach sand compared with nearby bathing
water.35,36 Halliday and Gast7 recently completed a comprehensive review of studies of fecal microbial pollution of
beach sand and observed that densities of fecal indicator
bacteria in wet sand were up to 38 times higher than in nearby
bathing waters. It has been hypothesized that sand could
serve as a source of fecal contamination for bathing water,
especially the surf zone along the shoreline.3,4,37 Others have

demonstrated that sand can serve as both a source and a sink
of fecal microbial contamination.14 Debate continues about
the applicability of fecal indicator bacteria (eg, E. coli and
Enterococcus) as a measure of beach water quality and fecal
contamination of beach sand.4,38,39 Several studies have examined potential for regrowth of E. coli and Enterococcus in
sand.18,19 Beach sand may serve as a source of autochthonous
fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli; Enterococcus) to nearby
bathing water in the absence of inputs from point sources of
fecal contamination (and associated pathogens). Beach sand
has been implicated as contributing unnecessarily to beach
advisories based on results of water-quality fecal indicator
bacteria tests.4,14 EPA guidelines for monitoring fresh and
marine recreational waters are based on E. coli and Enterococcus40,41; however, no guidelines exist for fecal contamination of sand.
Our results suggest that Enterococcus density in sand
increases the rate of GI illness and diarrhea among beachgoers who have contact with sand. The positive association of a
qPCR-based measure of Enterococcus in sand with enteric
illness was more consistent than that observed for a traditional culture-based measure of Enterococcus and several
© 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

alternative measures of sand fecal pollution (culture-based F⫹
coliphage, and qPCR-based Bacteroidales, fecal Bacteroides,
and Clostridium spp.). These alternative measures have been
considered by some to be more specific indicators of human
sewage sources of fecal contamination.9 Previous research
has demonstrated a consistent positive association between
Enterococcus calibrator cell equivalents and swimming-associated illness among both adults and children.21,22 Culturable
fecal indicator bacteria cells (eg, total and fecal coliforms, E.
coli, and Enterococcus) are considered a better measure of
viable bacteria associated with fecal pollution than qPCRbased measures, which reflect the genetic material of bacterial cells and may have differential environmental fates.42– 46
The 2 beaches were located near publicly owned treatment-works sewage outfalls. It is possible that fecal contamination from municipal sewage reached recreational beaches
through tidal flow, wave action, on-shore wind direction, or
currents. However, some evidence suggests that diffuse
sources (including coastal birds, other animal populations,
bather density, and run-off) may contribute most of the fecal
contamination to beach sand.47,48 It is unclear whether the
observed relationships of Enterococcus with enteric illness

can be generalized to beaches not influenced by municipal
sewage outfalls (ie, nonpoint source pollution beaches), to
freshwater beaches, or to tropical beaches where the population dynamics of fecal indicators in sand may be different.
Swimming was strongly associated with sand contact;
81% of swimmers versus 19% of nonswimmers reported
digging in sand, and 89% of swimmers versus 11% of
nonswimmers reported being buried in sand. As a result, our
study has little power to evaluate associations between sand
contact and illness among nonswimmers because there were
very few sand-exposed cases among nonswimmers. For example, among nonswimmers who dug in sand with Enterococcus in the highest tertile, there were no exposed diarrhea
cases and one exposed GI illness case. Therefore, although
we adjusted for swimming in all analyses of sand contact, it
is possible that associations between sand contact and illness
reflect exposure to contaminated water as well as sand. In our
previous study,34 which included more beaches but lacked
measures of fecal contamination of sand, digging in sand was
associated with GI illness (adjusted incidence proportion
ratio ⫽ 1.26 关95% CI ⫽ 1.03–1.54兴) and diarrhea (1.26
关0.98 –1.62兴) among nonswimmers, suggesting that sand may
be an additional route of exposure to pathogens.
Beachgoers’ contact with sand was assessed by questionnaire and included a question asking whether they had
contact with wet or dry sand. However, only wet sand was
104 | www.epidem.com

collected and analyzed for microbial measurements. We used
microbial quality in wet sand as a proxy for quality of all
sand. To examine the potential influence of misclassification
of exposure by wet versus dry sand contact, we examined
associations restricted to participants with wet sand contact only.
The results were similar to those among all participants. For
example, among tertiles of the qPCR-based Enterococcus measure, the aORs of associations with GI illness among those
digging in wet sand only were 1.02 (95% CI ⫽ 0.58 –1.80), 1.31
(0.71–2.43), and 2.48 (1.46 – 4.21), respectively.
Overall, associations were stronger among those buried
in sand (which represents a more intense form of sand
exposure) than among those digging in sand. Defining sand
exposure as any sand contact, including either digging in the
sand or buried in the sand, did not alter our conclusions (data
not shown).
Research on health effects among beachgoers has focused largely on swimming-associated illness and microbial
water quality. We show a relation of sand-contact activities
with GI illness and diarrhea as a function of objective
measures of fecal pollution of beach sand. Limitations of the
study include a small sample size for investigation of associations among subgroups (children, nonswimmers), use of
wet sand as a proxy for exposure to dry sand-contact activities, lack of tests of specific enteric pathogens in beach sand,
lack of analyses taking account of water quality, and lack of

objective measures of enteric illness self-reports by microbial
or immunologic tests of biospecimens. Laboratory confirmation of infection with pathogens via tests of saliva, blood, or
stool could improve the classification of incident symptoms.
Further investigation of sand exposure and its association
with enteric and nonenteric illness appears warranted based on
these results. It is unknown whether the relation of Enterococcus
in sand with GI illness and diarrhea can be extended to nonenteric illnesses (eg, skin rash, upper respiratory illness, eye irritation, earache, infected cuts/wounds). Further studies at a
broader geographic range of beach sites, including nonpoint
source run-off, freshwater, and tropical beaches, may advance
understanding of sand exposures associated with illness risk and
the association of densities of fecal-indicator organisms in beach
sand with illness risk among beachgoers.
