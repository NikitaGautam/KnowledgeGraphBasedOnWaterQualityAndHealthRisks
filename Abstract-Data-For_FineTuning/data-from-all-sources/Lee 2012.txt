rcobacter is a fastidious Gram-negative, non-spore-forming,
motile, spiral-shaped organism that belongs to the family
Campylobacteraceae (55, 56). Since the new genus Arcobacter was
first described in 1991 (55), Arcobacter has been detected in sewage, drinking water, surface water, and groundwater sources (9,
10, 14, 19, 21, 37, 38). This indicates that water can be a vehicle for
human exposure (9, 25). Besides environmental sources, researchers have observed Arcobacter spp. such as Arcobacter butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, and A. skirrowii in patients with diarrhea
and/or food-borne illness (13, 30, 33, 49, 60), which has led to
these microbes being characterized as potential food- and waterborne pathogens (1, 26). Moreover, the presence of Arcobacter in
livestock and processed meat (28, 29, 48) suggests that animals
may also serve as possible reservoirs for Arcobacter species. Therefore, the relative abundance, sources, and routes of human exposure particular to Arcobacter need to be considered a serious public
health concern.
Water recreational activities are among the most prominent
outdoor pursuits enjoyed by Americans. According to the Nationwide Survey on Recreation and the Environment (38a), 59.6% of
individuals visit beaches annually. Lake Erie has 62 public access
beaches along its Ohio shoreline (42). Despite serving as a valuable
recreational destination, the beach water of Lake Erie continues to
be contaminated with point and nonpoint sources originating
from humans, livestock, and wildlife, which can elevate the infectious disease risk for Ohio’s beachgoers (41). To maintain the
safety of Ohio’s beaches, beach advisories are issued when a single
beach water sample exceeds the daily maximum bacterial standard
(235 Escherichia coli CFU/100 ml) (41). The beach advisory is a
recommendation to the public to avoid swimming in water that
has exceeded the maximum bacterial standards for water quality
for the purpose of reducing swimming-related illnesses, although
an advisory does not officially close a beach to the public (53). In
2010, routine testing by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH)
showed that 21% of beach water samples resulted in beach advi-

sories (41). We monitored the Euclid, Villa Angela, and East and
West Headlands beaches in Ohio, which were among the most
visited beaches in 2010 (43). The Euclid and Villa Angela beaches
are highly contaminated urban beaches exhibiting water quality
results exceeding the daily maximum bacterial standard for 44%
and 40% of beach water samples, respectively, whereas the East
and West Headlands beaches are in a less densely populated area,
with percentages of excess of 15% and 16%, respectively (41).
Given the apparent fecal contamination in Lake Erie, concerns
pertaining to Arcobacter spp. have merit. With respect to Lake
Erie, Arcobacter was isolated in a gastrointestinal illness outbreak
at South Bass Island (44, 46). The outbreak was attributed to the
transport of microbial contaminants from wastewater treatment
facilities and septic tanks to the lake and subsurface water on the
island, which resulted in contamination of the drinking water
wells (19). Moreover, Arcobacter is significantly more prevalent in
water exhibiting high levels of fecal contamination (10). Thus, the
evidence suggests that the Euclid and Villa Angela beaches are
locations where Arcobacter is likely to be present and to pose a
significant human health risk via human-water contact.
In order to understand possible associations between the presence of Arcobacter, fecal contamination levels, and Arcobacter
sources, we determined the frequency of occurrence and density
of Arcobacter spp. in conjunction with densities of E. coli and other
genetic markers for fecal bacteria by using culture-based methods,
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, and sequence analysis. This is the

The genus Arcobacter has been associated with human illness and fecal contamination by humans and animals. To better characterize the health risk posed by this emerging waterborne pathogen, we investigated the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. in Lake Erie
beach waters. During the summer of 2010, water samples were collected 35 times from the Euclid, Villa Angela, and Headlands
(East and West) beaches, located along Ohio’s Lake Erie coast. After sample concentration, Arcobacter was quantified by realtime PCR targeting the Arcobacter 23S rRNA gene. Other fecal genetic markers (Bacteroides 16S rRNA gene [HuBac], Escherichia
coli uidA gene, Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, and tetracycline resistance genes) were also assessed. Arcobacter was detected frequently at all beaches, and both the occurrence and densities of Arcobacter spp. were higher at the Euclid and Villa Angela
beaches (with higher levels of fecal contamination) than at the East and West Headlands beaches. The Arcobacter density in Lake
Erie beach water was significantly correlated with the human-specific fecal marker HuBac according to Spearman’s correlation
analysis (r ⴝ 0.592; P < 0.001). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that most of the identified Arcobacter sequences were closely
related to Arcobacter cryaerophilus, which is known to cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans. Since human-pathogenic Arcobacter spp. are linked to human-associated fecal sources, it is important to identify and manage the human-associated contamination sources for the prevention of Arcobacter-associated public health risks at Lake Erie beaches.

first study to investigate the presence of Arcobacter at Lake Erie
beaches and provides evidence that recreational water is a potential transmission route enabling human exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site description and water sample collection. This study was conducted
at four Ohio freshwater public beaches located on Lake Erie. The Euclid
(41°35=9⬙N, 81°34=1⬙W) and Villa Angela (41°35=2⬙N, 81°34=9⬙W)
beaches are urban beaches located at Cleveland Lakefront State Park,
which was the most visited state park in Ohio in 2010 (9,285,452 total
visitor occasions in 2010) (43). Euclid Beach is a 200-m-long beach, and
Villa Angela offers a 300-m-long beach extending from Euclid Beach to
the mouth of Euclid Creek (8). Both beaches are protected by breakwaters,
and possible sources of fecal contamination include a large population of
birds using the east section of the bathing area, storm sewer outfalls feeding into Euclid Creek, and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and sanitary
sewer overflows (SSOs) occurring throughout the Euclid Creek drainage
(5, 20). Villa Angela is suspected to be impacted more greatly by water
from Euclid Creek, which is immediately adjacent to the east of the bathing area. The East Headlands (41°45=33⬙N, 81°17=21⬙W) and West Headlands (41°45=21⬙N, 81°17=37⬙W) beaches are located in a less densely populated area, but due to the 1.6-km-long, heavily used natural sand beaches
at Headlands Beach State Park, this park was the second most visited state
park in Ohio in 2010 (4,367,619 total visitor occasions in 2010) (43).
Sources of fecal contamination include septic systems, wastewater treatment plant effluent, and storm water runoff (20).
Water samples were collected 35 times, once daily, from each of the
four study beaches during the 2010 swimming season (from 13 July to 16
September 2010), with support of the Ohio Division of Parks and Recreation. Water samples were collected from beach waters in accordance with
the Ohio Department of Health sampling guidelines for beach waters
(40). Water collection at all beaches occurred at locations where the water
was approximately 1 m deep, in the center of the beach, and in the same
vicinity each collection day. Water samples were collected in 750-ml
Whirl-Pak bags by sweeping the container 30 cm below the water surface,
and the samples were transported on ice to a temporary field lab at the
Ohio State University Extension office in Painesville (Lake County, OH)
and filtered within an hour. Physicochemical parameters (water temperature, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen [DO], and water conductivity)
were measured in situ using a YSI water quality data sonde (Yellow Springs
Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) and a Hach turbidimeter (Hach Company, Loveland, CO). The data for wave height and precipitation were
obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s
National Weather Service (http://www.weather.gov).

Enumeration of indicator bacteria. From the beach water samples,
100, 50, and 20 ml of water were filtered through a mixed cellulose ester
filter (0.45-␮m pore size and 47-mm diameter; Millipore, Bedford, MA)
to enumerate fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci). E. coli was
cultured on modified m-TEC agar (Aquacheck Laboratory, Inc.,
Weathersfield, VT). The plates were preincubated at 35°C for 2 h and then
incubated at 44.5°C for 18 to 20 h. Red/magenta-colored colonies were
counted as E. coli (52). Enterococci were cultured on m-EI agar (Aquacheck Laboratory, Inc., Weathersfield, VT) at 41 ⫾ 0.5°C for 24 ⫾ 2 h.
Colonies with a blue halo were counted as enterococci (54).
Concentration and DNA extraction. Beach water samples (200 ml)
were prefiltered through 20-␮m-pore-size nylon filter membranes (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN) to remove algae and debris and then filtered
through a 0.45-␮m-pore-size mixed cellulose ester filter membrane (Pall
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). The membrane was transferred into a
50-ml sterile tube that contained 1.4 ml of ASL buffer from a QIAamp
DNA stool kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 0.1-mm- and 0.5-mm-diameter autoclaved glass beads (0.3 mg each; Biospec Products, Bartlesville,
OK). After bead beating with a Mini-Beadbeater 96 apparatus (BioSpec
Products, Bartlesville, OK) at 2,100 oscillations/min for 1 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new 2-ml microcentrifuge tube, followed by
DNA extraction using a QIAamp DNA stool kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then suspended in 200 ␮l of elution buffer.
The eluates were used immediately or stored at ⫺80°C until further processing.
Quantification of Arcobacter, fecal indicators, and tetracycline resistance genes by real-time qPCR. Real-time PCR assays were carried out
with an ABI 48-well StepOne Real Time system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA), using the extracted DNA samples. SYBR green-based
real-time qPCR was performed in duplicate, targeting the Arcobacter 23S
rRNA gene (Arco) and the tetracycline resistance gene tetQ (TetQ) as
described previously by Bastyns et al. (3), González et al. (23), and
Nikolich et al. (39), with minor modifications (Table 1). The real-time
qPCR mixture consisted of a total volume of 20 ␮l containing the DNA
templates (2 ␮l [2-ml portion of water sample] for Arco and 5 ␮l [5-ml
portion of water sample] for TetQ), 10 ␮l of SYBR green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 500 nM (each) primers (Table
1). Thermal cycling consisted of an initial cycle of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing and
extension at 60°C for 3 min. After amplification, melting curve analysis
was performed by heating samples to 95°C for 15 s, cooling them to 60°C
for 1 min for TetQ and for 3 min for Arco, and then heating them to 95°C
at a rate of 1.0°C/s. TaqMan-based real-time qPCR analysis was performed in duplicate, targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteroides-Prevotella

gene, based on the sequence of Arcobacter butzleri CCUG 10373 (GenBank
accession no. L14626). The seminested PCR protocol was the same as the
first PCR protocol. The seminested PCR results were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide.
Randomly selected Arcobacter-positive qPCR products (n ⫽ 13) and
all of the Arcobacter-positive seminested PCR products (n ⫽ 20) were
purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit. They were sequenced at
the Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility of the Ohio State University (http:
//pmgf.biosci.ohio-state.edu/), using a forward primer (Arco1 for the
qPCR products and 338f for the seminested PCR products) and an ABI
Prism 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences were
compared with those available in the GenBank databases by using the
PubMed NCBI BLAST program to identify sequenced products. To obtain accurate molecular identification of sequenced products, the partial
16S rRNA sequences of 20 seminested PCR products were aligned with
those of Arcobacter reference strains from GenBank as proposed by Levican et al. (34), with some modification, and the sequences were aligned
with Arcobacter reference strains. Preliminary alignment was done with
Clustal X (version 1.8) (51), with multiple alignments set to default. Regions of ambiguous alignment were excluded. Campylobacter jejuni
subsp. jejuni ATCC 33560 (GenBank accession no. M59298) was used as
an outgroup. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the
DNAPARS and DNADIST programs, followed by NEIGHBOUR, of the
PHYLIP package (version 3.57) (15). A phylogenetic tree was determined
using the Kimura two-parameter distance and neighbor-joining methods.
The phylogenetic tree was plotted with TREEVIEW (version 1.6.1) (47).
The statistical significance of phylogenies was estimated using the
SEQBOOT program for bootstrap analysis with 1,000 pseudoreplicate
data sets; only those having grouped with bootstrap values of ⬎50% were
considered significant.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with the
IBM SPSS (ver. 19.0.0; SPSS Inc.) statistics package. The data from the
real-time qPCR assays and counting methods were log transformed for all
analyses. The data obtained in this study were not normally distributed,
except for the number of E. coli CFU per 100 ml and the pH data (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test); therefore, statistical analyses were conducted using
nonparametric methods. The Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney
U test were used to compare Arco levels between sites or dates. Spearman’s
correlation analysis was used to test the possible correlations between
Arco, other genetic markers, and physicochemical parameters. To assess
the correlation between Arco densities and the occurrence of a beach
advisory, E. coli data were treated as binary, that is, a code of 0 was assigned
when the level of E. coli was below 235 CFU/100 ml, and a code of 1 was
assigned when the level of E. coli was above 235 CFU/100 ml.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The original sequences obtained in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under sequence accession numbers JQ302194 to JQ302206 and JQ754652 to
JQ754671.

RESULTS

Water quality parameters and enumeration of fecal indicator
bacteria. At each sampling site, physicochemical parameters were
measured in situ or retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service (Table 2).
The median values for most physicochemical parameters were
similar among sampling sites. Only the median values for turbidity were significantly different among sampling sites (P ⫽ 0.007 by
the Kruskal-Wallis test). This difference was particularly noticeable between the Euclid and Headlands beaches (P ⫽ 0.022;
Mann-Whitney U test) and between the Villa Angela and Headlands beaches (P ⫽ 0.006; Mann-Whitney U test). In September,
water temperature dropped sharply for all four beaches (P ⬍ 0.005
by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test). The

(HuBac), the uidA gene of E. coli (UidA), and the 23S rRNA gene of
Enterococcus spp. (Ent) as previously described by Bernhard and Field (4),
Okabe et al. (45), Chern et al. (6), and Ludwig and Schleifer (36), with
minor modifications. The real-time qPCR mixture consisted of a total
volume of 20 ␮l containing 5 ␮l (5-ml portion of water sample) of the
DNA template, 10 ␮l of TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 500 nM (each) primers, and 250 nM probe
(Table 1). The PCR protocol included an initial cycle of 50°C for 2 min
and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s
and annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 min for UidA and 2 min for Ent
and at 62°C for 1 min for HuBac. Cycle threshold (CT) values for real-time
qPCR results were determined with thresholds of 0.2 for Arco and “auto”
for the other genetic markers. The negative control for each qPCR assay
consisted of a mixture of all PCR reagents with nuclease-free water. The
following were used as positive controls: A. butzleri DSM 8739 (ATCC
49616) for Arco, Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 for HuBac, Enterococcus
faecium ATCC 19434 for Ent, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 for
TetQ (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), and E. coli
DH5␣ for UidA.
Quantification of genetic markers. To create a standard curve for
Arco quantification, amplicons generated from partial sequences of the
23S rRNA gene of A. butzleri DSM 8739 were amplified with forward and
reverse primers (Table 1), purified by use of a QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega
Co., Madison, WI), and transformed into E. coli DH5␣ competent cells by
use of a MicroPulser electroporator (25-␮F capacitance, 1.25 kV, 200-⍀
resistance; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Plasmid DNA was prepared using a
QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of
purified plasmid was measured with a NanoDrop system (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE), which used a standard curve derived
from 10-fold serial dilutions of plasmid DNA (1.19 ⫻ 107 to 1.19 ⫻ 10⫺1).
Real-time PCR assays were performed three times independently in triplicate to make standard curves by plotting CT values from the real-time
PCR assays versus the log of the bacterial gene copy numbers and drawing
a trend line through these points. For UidA quantification, 10-fold serial
dilutions of E. coli DH5␣ were prepared, and then a plot was made using
the CT values from qPCR and log gene copy numbers. The concentrations
of the other genetic markers were determined using standard curves generated in our previous study (32) and in the present study (data not
shown). The detection limits of Arco, HuBac, UidA, TetQ, and Ent realtime qPCRs were 11.9, 240, 20.5, 10.0, and 24.0 gene copies/reaction,
respectively. Samples measuring at or below the detection limit were replaced with a value equal to the detection limit for statistical analyses.
Seminested PCR and sequence analysis. In order to evaluate the genetic diversity of Arcobacter sequences detected, a seminested PCR assay
targeting the 16S rRNA gene was performed. The PCR procedure used was
that described by Harmon and Wesley (24), with some modifications. The
reaction mix was prepared with 2 ␮l of template (DNA from each sampling site), 2.5 ␮l of 10⫻ PCR buffer, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.75
mM MgCl2, a mix containing a 100 ␮M concentration of deoxynucleoside
triphosphate (dNTP), and 200 nM (each) forward (Arco1, 5=-AGAGATT
RGCCTGTATTGTAT-3=; R ⫽ A or G) (modified from the work of Harmon and Wesley [24]) and reverse (Arco2, 5=-AGAGATTGGCCTGTAT
TGTAT-3=) (24) primers that amplify a 1,201-bp region of the Arcobacter
16S rRNA gene, based on the sequence of Arcobacter butzleri CCUG 10373
(GenBank accession no. L14626), to make up a final volume of 25 ␮l. The
following cycling protocol was used: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4
min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min; and
a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. For seminested PCR amplification, 0.5
␮l of each first PCR product was added to a 20-␮l (final volume) PCR
mixture containing 2 ␮l of 10⫻ PCR buffer, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 1.5 mM MgCl2, a mix containing a 100 ␮M concentration of dNTP,
and 500 nM (each) forward (338f, 5=-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3=) (31) and reverse (Arco2, 5=-AGAGATTGGCCTGTATTGTAT-3=)
(24) primers that amplify a 1,087-bp region of the Arcobacter 16S rRNA

Parameter

from the Euclid and Villa Angela beaches exceeded Ohio’s daily
maximum bacterial standard, whereas only one sample and two
samples resulted in advisory conditions at the East and West
Headlands beaches, respectively (Table 3). There was a positive
correlation between E. coli and enterococci according to Spearman’s correlation analysis (r ⫽ 0.580; P ⬍ 0.001). Of the physicochemical parameters, the only observed correlation with these fecal indicators, albeit weak, was with water temperature (r ⫽ 0.252
and P ⫽ 0.004 for E. coli; r ⫽ 0.217 and P ⫽ 0.014 for enterococci).
qPCR analysis of Arcobacter spp. and fecal bacteria. A total of
129 beach water samples were analyzed for Arcobacter spp., using
a real-time qPCR assay. Arcobacter was detected frequently in the
water samples from the four beaches. Ninety-seven samples
(75.2%) were positive for Arcobacter, which was observed at a
higher frequency than the other measured genetic markers, which
occurred in 14.4% to 55.3% of the samples (Table 3). Nearly all
samples collected at the Euclid (32 of 32 samples [100%]) and

Arcobacter spp., while these microbes were detected in nearly half
of the samples collected at the Headlands beaches (15 of 33 samples [45.5%] for East Headlands and 19 of 31 samples [61.3%] for

from East Headlands (9.32 ⫻ 102 gene copies/100 ml; GSD ⫽
1.81) and West Headlands (9.63 ⫻ 102 gene copies/100 ml; GSD ⫽
1.84) (Fig. 1). The median values of the Arco levels in the Euclid
and Villa Angela samples were also ⬎10-fold higher than those in
East Headlands samples (Fig. 1). The observed densities for Arco
were significantly different among the sampling sites (P ⬍ 0.001
by the Kruskal-Wallis test), especially between the Euclid and
Headlands beaches and the Villa Angela and Headlands beaches
(P ⬍ 0.001 by the Mann-Whitney U test). Like the case for the
Arco marker, the median values for HuBac, UidA, and TetQ were
higher in the Euclid and Villa Angela samples, whereas the GMs of
Ent were statistically different only between the Euclid and West
Headlands samples (P ⬍ 0.005 by the Mann-Whitney U test).
For the four beaches, the monthly GMs and medians for the
Arco marker were higher in September than in the other months
(Fig. 2), although the only significant month-to-month difference
was shown for the Euclid samples (P ⫽ 0.039 by the KruskalWallis test and P ⬍ 0.05 by the Mann-Whitney U test). It is noteworthy that the Arco levels in beach water samples were observed
to be correlated weakly with water temperature (r ⫽ ⫺0.245; P ⫽
0.006) according to Spearman’s correlation analysis (Table 4).

With respect to temperature and Arco levels, a higher correlation
coefficient was observed for Headlands beach waters (r ⫽ ⫺0.346;
P ⫽ 0.036) than for Euclid and Villa Angela beach waters (r ⫽
⫺0.284; P ⫽ 0.024) (Table 4). The occurrence of a beach advisory
also had a weak correlation with the Arco level (r ⫽ 0.250; P ⫽
0.005) (Table 4). Moreover, the Arco levels on beach advisory days
(median value ⫽ 9.41 ⫻ 103 gene copies/100 ml) were higher than
those on nonadvisory days (median value ⫽ 1.89 ⫻ 102 gene copies/100 ml) (P ⫽ 0.0052 by the Mann-Whitney U test). HuBac,
UidA, and TetQ were negatively correlated with water temperature (r ⫽ ⫺0.401 and P ⬍ 0.001 for HuBac, r ⫽ ⫺0.206 and P ⫽
0.020 for UidA, and r ⫽ ⫺0.228 and P ⫽ 0.010 for TetQ). Meanwhile, according to Spearman’s correlation analysis, Arco levels in
the samples from the four beaches were correlated more strongly
with the three genetic markers (r ⬎ 0.400; P ⬍ 0.001) than with
the physicochemical parameters. This was most apparent in our
observation of the stronger correlation between Arco and HuBac
levels for Euclid and Villa Angela samples (r ⫽ 0.604; P ⬍ 0.001)
(Table 4).

the seminested PCR targeting the partial 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen
randomly selected qPCR products among the 97 qPCR-positive
samples and the 20 seminested PCR-positive products were sequenced, and their sequences were identified as Arcobacter by
comparison with those available in the GenBank databases, using
the PubMed NCBI BLAST program (data not shown). To obtain
more accurate identification of the sequenced products, phylogenetic analysis with the partial 16S rRNA sequences of seminested
PCR products was performed. Three different Arcobacter phylotypes were found for the 20 Arcobacter sequences (451 bp) de-

In this study, we investigated the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. in
water from four Lake Erie beaches, which are popular destinations
for local beachgoers and tourists in Ohio (43). Based on a report
from the ODH (41), the four study sites are often contaminated
with fecal pollution, and the Euclid and Villa Angela beaches are
highly contaminated beaches, whereas the Headlands beaches are
less contaminated. The previously reported ODH observations
were supported by our results showing that the median levels of
traditional fecal indicators (E. coli and enterococci) and both the
occurrence and median levels of genetic markers (HuBac, UidA,
and TetQ) were statistically higher in Euclid and Villa Angela waters than in Headlands waters (P ⬍ 0.005) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
The Arcobacter results showed similar trends at these sites. Arcobacter was observed frequently at all of the beaches during the

tected in this study (Fig. 3). Fifteen sequences (75.0%) were identical to or had one base pair difference from A. cryaerophilus
strains, with significant bootstrap values (Fig. 3). Four sequences
were identical to the uncultured environmental clone DS017
(GenBank accession no. DQ234101), detected in the Danshui
River estuary in Northern Taiwan (35), with a 98% bootstrap
value. These sequences were also closely related to A. ellisii (99.3%
identity), which was recently added as an Arcobacter species (18).
Lastly, one sequence showed high similarity to A. cibarius reference strains (99.8% identity), with an 80% bootstrap value.

using other genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene. The main
reason that the identification of Arcobacter sequences by phylogenetic inference was limited was that there is very little information
on 23S rRNA sequences of recently identified Arcobacter species,
such as A. ellisii, A. defluvii, A. bivalviorum, and A. venerupis (12,
18, 34). Since the taxonomy of Arcobacter species has been based
on analyses of the 16S rRNA gene (9, 58), a seminested PCR assay
targeting the 16S rRNA gene was performed on the Arcobacter
real-time qPCR-positive samples. Of 97 Arcobacter-positive samples, only 20 samples (10 for Euclid, 8 for Villa Angela, and 2 for
West Headlands) showed visible bands on agarose gels (Fig. 3).
Most of the 77 seminested PCR-negative samples did not seem to
be falsely positive by qPCR, because 9 of 13 sequences from qPCR
products could be obtained from seminested PCR-negative samples (data not shown). The lower recovery of Arcobacter sequences
from the Headlands samples (2 seminested PCR-positive samples
among 34 real-time qPCR-positive samples [5.9%]) than from the
Euclid and Villa Angela samples (18/63 samples [28.6%]) may
have been due to the low Arcobacter densities in Headlands samples (geometric mean, ⬃20 gene copies/reaction [1,000 gene copies/100 ml]) (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic analysis showed that most
of the Arcobacter sequences detected in the Lake Erie beach waters
(15 of 20 sequences) were closely related to A. cryaerophilus (Fig.
3), which is prevalent in fecally contaminated water (9, 10) and
frequently associated with human gastrointestinal diseases and
animal diseases (8). This result was different from those of other
studies showing that both A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus were the
most prevalent Arcobacter species in natural freshwater environments (10, 11, 16). The higher prevalence of A. cryaerophilus in
this study can be explained by the use of qPCR; A. cryaerophilus in
other water studies may have been underestimated due to the
difficulty in isolating this organism (because of its susceptibility to
antimicrobials used in the isolation medium) or because of a
lower growth rate than that of A. butzleri (22) with the culture
methods used in those studies. Among the other five sequences,
one sequence was only one base pair different from reference
strains of A. cibarius, which was first isolated from chicken
broiler carcasses (27) and is associated with pigs and pig environments (7), suggesting that Arcobacter contamination in
Lake Erie may originate partly from animal-associated fecal
sources. The other four sequences were identical to the uncultured environmental clone DS017 (GenBank accession no.
DQ234101), detected in the Danshui River estuary in Northern
Taiwan (35), and were also closely related to A. ellisii (99.3%
identity), which was isolated from mussels (18). These data
indicate that Arcobacter species which have not yet been isolated or are not well studied may be considerably present in
Lake Erie. Consequently, phylogenetic analysis suggests that
Lake Erie beach water may serve as a possible reservoir for
Arcobacter species that may originate from human and animal
sources, some of which could be human pathogens.
In summary, our results demonstrate that human-pathogenic
Arcobacter was prevalent in the water at four Lake Erie beaches
during the 2010 swimming season. Since the major contamination sources of Arcobacter may originate from human-associated
fecal contamination, it is important to identify and manage its
sources to minimize public health risks linked to Arcobacter exposure in this region.

swimming season of 2010, but both the occurrence and median
level of the Arco marker were higher for the Euclid and Villa Angela beaches than for the Headlands beaches (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
The Arcobacter abundance in the beach waters with higher levels of
fecal contamination was further supported by the statistical results. Arco levels in the samples from the four beaches were correlated with beach advisories (r ⫽ 0.250; P ⫽ 0.005) and with three
genetic markers (HuBac, UidA, and TetQ) (r ⬎ 0.400; P ⬍ 0.001)
(Table 4). Moreover, Arco levels were correlated significantly with
HuBac levels at the highly contaminated beaches (Euclid and Villa
Angela) (r ⫽ 0.604; P ⬍ 0.001). However, no significant relationship between Arco and HuBac levels was found at the less contaminated beaches (Headlands) (Table 4). The association between
the Arco marker and fecal indicators in this study is consistent
with previous findings demonstrating a positive association between Arcobacter spp. and bacterial indicators in freshwater and
seawater (10, 11). Fong et al. (19) also reported that the Arcobacter-associated waterborne illness outbreak at Lake Erie’s South
Bass Island in 2004 was related to fecal contamination, whereby
the highest density of Arcobacter spp. was observed in the water
samples with the highest level of fecal contamination as determined by fecal indicator bacteria.
Our results showed that according to Spearman’s correlation
analysis, HuBac (a Bacteroides-Prevotella marker) was the genetic
marker most strongly correlated with the Arco marker (r ⫽ 0.592;
P ⬍ 0.001) among the fecal contamination markers (Table 4). It
can be suggested that human fecal sources are likely to be a key
contributor to Arcobacter contamination at these four Lake Erie
beaches, since our Arcobacter results demonstrate an association
with the HuBac marker, which was designed to be human specific
(45). These results are interesting, particularly because E. coli and
enterococcus levels measured by traditional culture-based methods, as well as the levels of the other two genetic markers (UidA
and TetQ), which were designed to detect general fecal contamination (6, 39) without host specificity (2), did not show a significant correlation with Arco. In addition, beach advisories showed a
weak relationship with Arco levels (r ⫽ 0.250; P ⫽ 0.005).
The abundance of Arcobacter was higher in September than in
the other months (July and August) (Fig. 2) and was negatively
correlated with water temperature (Table 4), which can be explained by previous research reporting that Arcobacter spp. may
survive better at lower temperatures in water (17, 57). Therefore,
it also can be suggested that water temperature is another key
contributor to Arcobacter levels in Lake Erie beach water during
the swimming season.
A general concern in the use of PCR detection for environmental monitoring is the potential presence of PCR inhibitors in water
samples, as this may generate false-negative and/or biased results.
In this study, the influence of any false-negative and/or biased
results on our result interpretation could be negligible, because
122 of 129 beach water samples (94.6%) were positive for at least
one of the genetic markers tested (data not shown). In future
studies, the use of appropriate process controls should occur to
reduce potential problems associated with PCR inhibition, as suggested by Wolf et al. (59).
Our results showed that 13 sequences from the qPCR products
(partial 23S rRNA genes) were identified as Arcobacter sequences
by comparison with those available in the GenBank databases,
using the PubMed NCBI BLAST program. However, Arcobacter
identification based on the 23S rRNA gene was less accurate than
