Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids

INGESTION OF WATER AND OTHER
SELECT LIQUIDS
3.1. INTRODUCTION
This document is an update to Chapter 3 (Ingestion
of Water and Selected Liquids) of the Exposure
Factors Handbook; 2011 Edition (U.S. EPA, 2011).
New information that has become available since 2011
has been added, and the recommended values have
been revised as needed to reflect the additional
information. The recommended values for the general
population in this chapter have been updated using
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data for 2005−2010; the 2011 version of
this chapter used NHANES data for 2003−2006 for
individuals ≥3 years of age and Continuing Survey of
Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) data for 19941996, and 1998 for children <3 years of age. Appendix
A provides a comparison of the intake rates based on
NHANES 2005-2010 data to those based on NHANES
2003-2006 and CSFII 1994-96 and 1998. Data for
pregnant and lactating women have also been updated
using NHANES 2005-2010 data. This update also
provides, for the first time, water intake data for
formula-fed infants. Recent relevant studies based on
data other than NHANES and CSFII are also
summarized to provide additional perspective on
drinking water intake.
The chapter includes a comprehensive review of
the scientific literature through 2017. The new
literature was identified via formal literature searches
conducted by EPA library services as well as targeted
internet searches conducted by the authors of this
chapter. Appendix B provides a list of the key terms
that were used in the literature searches. Revisions to
this chapter have been made in accordance with the
approved quality assurance plan for the Exposure
Factors Handbook.
Water ingestion is a pathway of exposure to
environmental chemicals. Contamination of water
may occur at the water supply source (groundwater or
surface water); during treatment (for example, toxic
by-products may be formed during chlorination); or
post-treatment (such as leaching of lead or other
materials from plumbing systems). People may be
exposed to contaminants in water when consuming
water directly as a beverage, indirectly from foods and
drinks made with water, or incidentally while
swimming or engaging in other water-related
activities. Estimating the magnitude of the potential
dose of toxics from water ingestion requires
information on the quantity of water consumed. The
purpose of this section is to describe key and relevant
published studies that provide information on water
ingestion for various populations and to provide

February 2019

recommended ingestion rate values for use in exposure
assessments. As described in Chapter 1 of the
Exposure Factors Handbook: 2011 Edition
(U.S. EPA, 2011), key studies represent those studies
that are the most up-to-date and scientifically sound
for deriving recommendations for exposure factors,
whereas other studies are designated “relevant,”
meaning applicable or pertinent, but not necessarily
the most important. For example, studies that provide
supporting data or information related to the factor of
interest (e.g., number of drinking events per day), or
have study designs or approaches that make the data
less applicable to the population of interest
(e.g., studies not conducted in the United States) have
been designated as relevant rather than key. Key
studies were selected based on the general assessment
factors described in Chapter 1 of the handbook. The
studies described in this section provide information
on ingestion of water consumed as a beverage or in
foods or beverages containing tap water, ingestion of
other select liquids, and ingestion of water while
swimming.
Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has assumed a drinking water ingestion rate of
2 L/day for adults and 1 L/day for infants and children
under 10 years of age (U.S. EPA, 2000a). This rate
includes water consumed in the form of juices and
other beverages containing tap water. The National
Research Council (NRC, 1977) estimated that daily
consumption of water may vary with levels of physical
activity and fluctuations in temperature and humidity.
It is reasonable to assume that people engaging in
physically demanding activities or living in warmer
regions may have higher levels of water ingestion.
However, there is limited information on the effects of
activity level and climatic conditions on water
ingestion.
U.S. EPA’s analysis of 2005−2010 data from the
NHANES was selected as the key study of drinking
water ingestion for the general population and for
pregnant and lactating women. NHANES 2005−2010
contains the most up-to-date information on water
intake rate estimates. Kahn et al. (2013) was selected
as a key study for formula-fed infants. Kahn et al.
(2013) used data from U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA’s) 1994−1996, 1998 CSFII.
The U.S. EPA analysis of NHANES data and the
analyses of CSFII data by Kahn et al. (2013) generated
ingestion rates for direct and indirect ingestion of
water. Direct ingestion is defined as direct
consumption of water as a beverage, while indirect
ingestion includes water added during food or
beverage preparation, but not water intrinsic to
purchased foods (i.e., water that is naturally contained
in foods) (Kahn and Stralka, 2008). Data for

Page 3-1



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
consumption of water from various sources (i.e., the
community water supply, bottled water, and other
sources) are also presented. It is noted that the type of
water people drink has changed in the last decade, as
evidenced by the increase in bottled water
consumption (see Appendix A). However, the
majority of the U.S. population consumes water from
public (i.e., community) water distribution systems;
about 15% of the U.S. population obtains their water
from private (i.e., household) wells, cisterns, or
springs
(U.S.
EPA,
2002;
https://www.epa.gov/privatewells/about-privatewater-wells). Regardless of the source of the water, the
physiological need for water should be the same
among populations using community or private water
systems. For the purposes of exposure assessments
involving site-specific contaminated drinking water,
ingestion rates based on the community supply are
most appropriate. Given the assumption that bottled
water, and purchased foods and beverages that contain
water are widely distributed and less likely to contain
source-specific water, the use of total water ingestion
rates may overestimate the potential exposure to toxic
substances present only in local water supplies;
therefore, tap water ingestion of community water,
rather than total water ingestion, is emphasized in this
section.
The key studies on water ingestion for the general
population and pregnant and lactating women
(NHANES), and the populations of formula-fed
infants (CSFII) are based on short-term survey data
(2 days). Although short-term data may be suitable for
obtaining mean or median ingestion values that are
representative of both short- and long-term ingestion
distributions, upper- and lower-percentile values may
be different for short-term and long-term data. Note
too that most currently available water ingestion
surveys are based on respondent recall, which may be
a source of uncertainty in the estimated ingestion rates
because of the subjective nature of this type of survey
technique. Percentile distributions for water ingestion
are presented in this handbook, where sufficient data
are available. Information on ingestion of water based
on climate and activity level, and on incidental
ingestion of water while swimming, is also provided
in this chapter.
Section 3.2 provides the recommendations and
confidence ratings for use in risk assessment for
community water ingestion among the general
population, formula-fed infants, and pregnant and
lactating women, and water ingestion among
swimmers. Section 3.3.1 provides the key studies for
general population water ingestion rates, Section 3.4.1
provides ingestion rates for pregnant and lactating
women, Section 3.5.1 provides ingestion rates for

February 2019

formula-fed infants, Section 3.7 provides ingestion
rates for swimmers, and Section 3.8 provides data for
other inadvertent water ingestion. For water ingestion
at high activity levels or hot climates, no
recommendations are provided, but Section 3.6
includes relevant studies on this topic. Relevant
studies on all subcategories of water ingestion are also
presented to provide the reader with added perspective
on the current state of knowledge pertaining to
ingestion of water and select liquids.
3.2. RECOMMENDATIONS
3.2.1. Water Ingestion from Consumption of
Water as a Beverage and from Food and
Drink
The recommended general population water
ingestion rate values for the consumption of water as
a beverage (direct) and from foods and drinks
(indirect) are based on U.S. EPA’s analysis of
NHANES data from 2005−2010. Table 3-1 presents a
summary of the recommended values for direct and
indirect ingestion of community water. Per capita
mean and 95th percentile values range from
145 mL/day to 956 mL/day and 565 mL/day to
2,976 mL/day, respectively, depending on the age
group. Consumer-only mean and 95th percentile values
range from 245 mL/day to 1,419 mL/day and
658 mL/day to 3,407 mL/day, respectively, depending
on the age group. Per capita intake rates represent
intake that has been averaged over the entire
population (including those individuals that reported
no intake). In general, per capita intake rates are
appropriate for use in exposure assessments for which
average daily dose estimates are of interest because
they represent both individuals who drank water
during the survey period and individuals who may
drink water at some time but did not consume it during
the survey period. Consumer-only intake rates
represent the quantity of water consumed only by
individuals who reported water intake during the
survey period. Table 3-2 presents a characterization of
the overall confidence in the accuracy and
appropriateness of the recommendations for drinking
water intake for use in risk assessments.
3.2.2. Pregnant and Lactating Women
Based upon the results of the U.S. EPA analysis of
2005−2010 NHANES data, per capita mean and 95th
percentile values for ingestion of drinking water
among pregnant women were 731 mL/day and
2,859 mL/day, respectively. The per capita mean and
95th percentile values for lactating women were
1,075 mL/day and 3,061 mL/day, respectively.
Table 3-3 presents a summary of the recommended

Page 3-2



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
values for water ingestion rates. Table 3-4 presents the
confidence ratings for these recommendations.
3.2.3. Formula-Fed Infants
The recommended values for drinking water
ingestion rates for formula-fed infants are based on the
results of Kahn et al. (2013). The mean total direct and
indirect water intake values are 505, 627, 699, 691,
and 591 mL/day for ages <1 month, 1 to <3 months,
3 to <6 months, 6 to <12 months, and 1 to <2 years,
respectively. The 95th percentile total direct and
indirect water intake values are 858, 1,096, 1,300,
1,350, and 1,254 for ages <1 month, 1 to <3 months,
3 to <6 months, 6 to <12 months, and 1 to <2 years,
respectively. Table 3-5 presents a summary of the
recommended values for formula-fed infants, and
Table 3-6 presents the confidence ratings for the
recommended values for formula-fed infants.
3.2.4.

Water Ingestion While Swimming or
Diving
Based on the data from Dufour (2017), mean
swimming pool water ingestion rates were 38, 44, 33,
and 28 mL/hour for ages 6 to <11, 11 to <16, 16 to
<21, and 21+ years, respectively. Upper percentile
(95th percentile) swimming pool water ingestion rates
were 96, 152, 105, and 92 mL/hour for ages 6 to <11,
11 to <16, 16 to <21, and 21+ years, respectively.
Although these estimates were derived from
swimming pool experiments, Dufour et al. (2006)
noted that swimming behavior of recreational pool
swimmers may be similar to freshwater swimmers.
Estimates may be different for saltwater swimmers
and competitive swimmers. Table 3-7 presents a
summary of the recommended values for water
ingestion rates while swimming. Table 3-8 presents
the confidence ratings for these recommendations.
Data on the amount of time spent swimming can be
found in Chapter 16 (see Table 16-1) of this handbook.

Rationale
The survey methodology and data analysis were adequate. The
surveys sampled approximately 25,000 (NHANES) individuals;
sample size varied with age.

The key studies were directly relevant to water ingestion.
The data were demographically representative (based on stratified
random sample). Sample sizes for some age groups were limited.

Currency

NHANES data were collected between 2005 and 2010.

Data Collection Period

Data were collected for 2 nonconsecutive days. However, long-term
variability may be small. Use of a short-term average as a chronic
ingestion measure can be assumed.
NHANES data are publicly available.

Reproducibility

The methodology was clearly presented; enough information was
included to reproduce the results.

DRINKING WATER INGESTION
STUDIES
3.3.1. Key Drinking Water Ingestion Study for
the General Population
This section provides a summary of the key study
on water ingestion among the general population. This
key study is the basis for the recommended water
estimates for use in risk assessments involving the
general population.
3.3.1.1. U.S. EPA Analysis of NHANES 2005−2010
Data
The U.S. EPA used the combined 2005−2006,
2007−2008, and 2009−2010 NHANES data sets to
estimate water ingestion rates for the general
population. The 2005−2010 data set included
information on nearly 25,000 individuals. The U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed
households across the United States and collected food
and beverage recall data for 2 nonconsecutive days as
part of the NHANES. The first dietary recall interview
was conducted in person in a Mobile Examination
Center, and the second was collected by telephone 3 to
10 days later on a different day of the week. Each
individual in the survey was assigned a sample weight
based on his or her demographic data. These weights
were taken into account when calculating mean and
percentile water ingestion rates from various sources.
The U.S. EPA, Office of Pesticide Programs used
NHANES 2005−2010 data to update the Food
Commodity Intake Database (FCID) that was
developed for earlier analyses of data from the
USDA’s CSFII (USDA, 2000; U.S. EPA, 2000a, b)
and NHANES 2003−2006 (U.S. EPA, 2011). In the
FCID, NHANES data on the foods people reported
eating were converted to the quantities of agricultural
commodities eaten, including water that was added in
the preparation of foods and beverages. The updated
FCID is available at: http://fcid.foodrisk.org/, along
with the FCID Consumption Calculator which was
used to develop the estimates provided in this chapter
for various age groups of the population. This
calculator may also be used to develop estimates for
other age groups or population, customized to the
users’ needs.
U.S. EPA derived mean and percentile estimates of
daily average water ingestion for the following age
categories: Birth to <1 month, 1 to <3 months, 3 to
<6 months, 6 to <12 months, 1 to <2 years of age, 2 to
<3 years, 3 to <6 years, 6 to <11 years, 11 to <16 years,
16 to <21 years of age, adults 21 years and older in
10-year increments, and all ages. Intake estimates are
also provided for some additional age ranges that may
be of use to risk assessors, including ages birth to

February 2019

<2 years, 2 to <16 years, 16 to <70 years, 21 to <50
years, and 50+ years.
Consumer-only and per capita water ingestion
estimates were generated for four water source
categories: community water, bottled water, other
sources, and all sources. Consumer-only intake
represents the quantity of water consumed by
individuals during the survey period. These data are
generated by averaging intake across only the
individuals in the survey who reported consumption of
water. Per capita intake rates are generated by
averaging consumer-only intakes over the entire
population (including those individuals that reported
no intake). In general, per capita intake rates are
appropriate for use in exposure assessments for which
average dose estimates are of interest because they
represent both individuals who drank water during the
survey period and individuals who may drink water at
some time but did not consume it during the survey
period. “All sources” included water from all supply
sources such as community water supply (i.e., tap
water), bottled water, other sources, and
missing/unknown sources. “Community water”
included tap water from a community or municipal
water supply. “Other sources” included wells, springs,
cisterns,
other
nonspecified
sources,
and
missing/unknown sources that the survey respondent
was unable to identify. The water ingestion estimates
for community water, other sources, and all sources
included both water ingested directly as a beverage
(direct water) and water added to foods and beverages
during final preparation at home or by local food
service establishments such as school cafeterias and
restaurants (indirect water). Bottled water estimates
include direct ingestion only. Commercial water added
by a manufacturer (i.e., water contained in soda or
beer) and intrinsic water in foods and liquids (i.e., milk
and natural undiluted juice) were not included in the
estimates. NHANES water consumption respondent
data were averaged over both days of dietary data.
Intake rate distributions were provided in units of
mL/day and mL/kg-day. The body weights of survey
participants were used in developing intake rate
estimates in units of mL/kg-day.
Tables 3-9 to 3-24 present full distributions for the
various water source categories (community water,
bottled water, other sources, and all sources).
Tables 3-9 to 3-12 provide per capita water ingestion
estimates in mL/day for the various water source
categories (i.e., community, bottled, other, and all
sources). Tables 3-13 to 3-16 present the same
information as Tables 3-9 to 3-12, but in units of
mL/kg-day. Tables 3-17 to 3-20 provide
consumers-only water ingestion estimates in mL/day
for the various source categories. Tables 3-21 to 3-24

Page 3-13



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
present the same information as Tables 3-17 to 3-20,
but in units of mL/kg-day. Estimates that do not meet
the minimum sample size as described in the Joint
Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical
Reporting Standards on NHANES III and CSFII
Reports: NHIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group
Recommendations (NCHS, 1993), are flagged in the
tables. The design effect used to determine the
minimum required sample size was domain specific
(i.e., calculated separately for various age groups).
When indexed to body weight, the per capita
ingestion rate of water from all sources combined for
children under 6 months of age was more than 4 times
higher than that of adults ≥21 years (see Table 3-16).
Among consumers-only younger than 6 months of
age, the ingestion rate for all sources combined was
more than 5 times that of adults when indexed to body
weight (see Table 3-24). The pattern of decreasing
water ingestion per unit of body weight was also
observed in per capita and consumers-only estimates
of community water (see Tables 3-13 and 3-21), and
other sources (see Tables 3-15 and 3-23). However,
this trend was not observed in estimates of bottled
water.
The advantages of U.S. EPA’s analysis of the
2005−2010 NHANES surveys are (1) that the surveys
were designed to obtain a statistically valid sample of
the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population
(i.e., the sampling frame was organized using 2000
U.S. population census estimates); (2) several sets of
sampling weights were available for use with the
intake data to facilitate proper analysis of the data;
(3) the sample size was sufficient to allow
categorization within narrowly defined age categories,
and the large sample provided useful information on
the overall distribution of ingestion by the population
and should adequately reflect the range among
respondent variability; (4) the survey was conducted
over 2 nonconsecutive days, which improved the
variance over consecutive days of consumption; and
(5) the most current FCID data set was used. One
limitation of the data is that the data were collected
over only 2 days and do not necessarily represent
“usual” intake. “Usual dietary intake” refers to the
long-term average of daily intakes by an individual.
Thus, water ingestion estimates based on short-term
data may differ from long-term rates, especially at the
tails of the distribution. There are, however, several
limitations associated with these data. Water intake
estimates for some age groups, particularly at the tails
of the distribution, are less statistically reliable due to
small sample sizes, as noted in Tables 3-9 to 3-24. In
addition, NHANES does not allow for the allocation
of indirect water intake in estimating bottled water
consumption. Another limitation of these data is that

February 2019

the survey design, while being well tailored for the
overall population of the United States and conducted
throughout the year to account for seasonal variation,
is of limited use for assessing small and potentially
at-risk populations based on ethnicity, medical status,
geography/climate, or other factors such as activity
level.
Relevant Drinking Water Ingestion
Studies for the General Population
The sections that follow provide summaries of
studies on water ingestion among the general
population that have been categorized as relevant
rather than key. Studies were classified as relevant if
they provided supporting water ingestion data
(e.g., older studies, studies that provided information
on the source of water) or information related to the
factor of interest (e.g., physiologic need for water), or
the study design or approach makes the data less
applicable to the population of interest (e.g., small
sample size, limited to certain age groups).
3.3.2.

3.3.2.1. Wolf (1958)—Body Water Content
Wolf (1958) provided information on the water
content of human bodies, stating that a newborn baby
is about 77% water while an adult male is about 60%
water by weight. An adult male gains and loses about
2,750 mL of water each day. Water intake in dissimilar
mammals varies according to 0.88 power of body
weight.
Research
Council
3.3.2.2. National
(1977)―Drinking Water and Health
NRC (1977) calculated the average per capita
water (liquid) consumption per day to be 1.63 L. This
figure was based on a survey of the following literature
sources: Starling (1941); Bourne and Kidder (1953);
Walker et al. (1957); Wolf (1958); Guyton (1968);
McNall and Schlegel (1968); Randall (1973); NRC
(1974); and Pike and Brown (1975) as cited in NRC
(1977). Although the calculated average intake rate
was 1.63 L/day, NRC (1977) adopted a larger rate
(2 L/day) to represent the intake of the majority of
water consumers. This value is relatively consistent
with the total tap water intakes rate estimated from the
key study presented in this chapter. However, the use
of the term “liquid” was not clearly defined in this
study, and it is not known whether the populations
surveyed are representative of the adult U.S.
population. Consequently, the results of this study are
of limited use in recommending total tap water intake
rates, and this study is not considered a key study.

3.3.2.3. Pennington (1983)―Revision of the Total
Diet Study Food List and Diets
Based on data from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's Total Diet Study, Pennington (1983)
reported average intake rates for various foods and
beverages for five age groups of the population. The
Total Diet Study is conducted annually to monitor the
nutrient and contaminant content of the U.S. food
supply and to evaluate trends in consumption.
Representative diets were developed based on 24-hour
recall and 2-day diary data from the 1977−1978
USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Survey
(NFCS) and 24-hour recall data from the Second
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES II). The numbers of participants in NFCS
and NHANES II were approximately 30,000 and
20,000, respectively. The diets were developed to
“approximate 90% or more of the weight of the foods
usually consumed” (Pennington, 1983). The source of
water (bottled water as distinguished from tap water)
was not stated in the Pennington study. For the
purposes of this report, the consumption rates for the
food categories defined by Pennington (1983) were
used to calculate total fluid and total water intake rates
for five age groups. Total water includes water, tea,
coffee, soft drinks, and soups and frozen juices that are
reconstituted with water. Reconstituted soups were
assumed to be composed of 50% water, and juices
were assumed to contain 75% water. Total fluids
include total water in addition to milk, ready-to-use
infant formula, milk-based soups, carbonated soft
drinks, alcoholic beverages, and canned fruit juices.
Table 3-25 presents these intake rates. Based on the
average intake rates for total water for the two adult
age groups, 1.04 and 1.26 L/day, the average adult
intake rate is about 1.15 L/day. These rates should be
more representative of the amount of source-specific
water consumed than are total fluid intake rates. This
study, which used both USDA 1978 data and
NHANES II data, was designed to measure food
intake. Consequently, no systematic attempt was
necessarily made to define tap water intake per se, as
distinguished from bottled water. For this reason, it is
not considered a key tap water study in this document.
3.3.2.4. U.S. EPA (1984)―An Estimation of the
Daily Average Food Intake by Age and Sex
for Use in Assessing the Radionuclide
Intake of the General Population
Using data collected by USDA in the 1977−1978
NFCS, U.S. EPA (1984) determined daily food and
beverage intake levels by age to be used in assessing
radionuclide intake through food consumption. Tap
water, water-based drinks, and soups were identified

February 2019

subcategories of the total beverage category.
Table 3-26 presents daily intake rates for tap water,
water-based drinks, soup, and total beverages. As seen
in Table 3-26, mean tap water intake for different adult
age groups (age 20 years and older) ranged from 0.62
to 0.76 L/day, water-based drinks intake ranged from
0.34 to 0.69 L/day, soup intake ranged from 0.04 to
0.06 L/day, and mean total beverage intake levels
ranged from 1.48 to 1.73 L/day. Total tap water intake
rates were estimated by combining the average daily
intakes of tap water, water-based drinks, and soups for
each age group. For adults (ages 20 years and older),
mean total tap water intake rates range from 1.04 to
1.47 L/day, and for children (ages <1 to 19 years),
mean intake rates range from 0.19 to 0.90 L/day. The
total tap water intake rates, derived by combining data
on tap water, water-based drinks, and soup should be
more representative of source-specific drinking water
intake than the total beverage intake rates reported in
this study. The chief limitation of the study is that the
data were collected in 1978 and do not reflect the
expected increase in the U.S. consumption of soft
drinks and bottled water or changes in the diet within
the last three decades. Because the data were collected
for only a 3-day period, the extrapolation to chronic
intake is uncertain. Also, these intake rates do not
include reconstituted infant formula. For these
reasons, this is not considered a key study in this
document.
3.3.2.5. Cantor et al. (1987)―Bladder Cancer,
Drinking Water Source, and Tap Water
Consumption
The
National
Cancer
Institute,
in
a
population-based, case control study investigating the
possible relationship between bladder cancer and
drinking water, interviewed approximately 8,000 adult
white individuals, 21 to 84 years of age (2,805 cases
and 5,258 controls) in their homes, using a
standardized questionnaire (Cantor et al., 1987). The
cases and controls resided in one of five metropolitan
areas (Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans, San Francisco,
and Seattle) and five states (Connecticut, Iowa, New
Jersey, New Mexico, and Utah). The individuals
interviewed were asked to recall the level of intake of
tap water and other beverages in a typical week during
the winter prior to the interview. Total beverage intake
was divided into the following two components:
(1) beverages derived from tap water and
(2) beverages from other sources. Tap water used in
cooking foods and in ice cubes was apparently not
considered. Participants also supplied information on
the primary source of the water consumed (i.e., private
well, community supply, bottled water, etc.). The

Page 3-15



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
control population was randomly selected from the
general population and frequency matched to the
bladder cancer case population in terms of age, sex,
and geographic location of residence. The case
population consisted of whites only and had no people
under the age of 21 years; 57% were over the age of
65 years. The fluid intake rates for the bladder cancer
cases were not used because their participation in the
study was based on selection factors that could bias the
intake estimates for the general population. Based on
responses from 5,258 white controls (3,892 males;
1,366 females), average tap water intake rates for a
“typical” week were compiled by sex, age group, and
geographic region. Table 3-27 lists these rates. The
average total fluid intake rate was 2.01 L/day for men,
of which 70% (1.4 L/day) was derived from tap water,
and 1.72 L/day for women, of which 79% (1.35 L/day)
was derived from tap water. Table 3-28 presents
frequency distribution data for the 5,228 controls, for
which the authors had information on both tap water
consumption and cigarette smoking habits. These data
follow a lognormal distribution having an average
value of 1.30 L/day and an upper 90th percentile value
of approximately 2.40 L/day. These values were
determined by graphically interpolating the data of
Table 3-28 after plotting it on log probability graph
paper. These values represent the usual level of intake
for this population of adults in the winter. Limitations
associated with this data set are that the population
surveyed was older than the general population and
consisted exclusively of whites. Also, the intake data
are based on recall of behavior during the winter only.
Extrapolation of the data to other seasons is difficult.
The authors presented data on person-years of
residence with various types of water supply sources
(municipal vs. private, chlorinated vs. nonchlorinated,
and surface vs. well water). Unfortunately, these data
cannot be used to draw conclusions about the national
average apportionment of surface versus groundwater
because a large fraction (24%) of municipal water
intake in this survey could not be specifically
attributed to either ground or surface water.
3.3.2.6. Ershow and Cantor (1989)—Total Water
and Tap Water Intake in the United States:
Population-Based Estimates of Quantities
and Sources
Ershow and Cantor (1989) estimated water intake
rates based on data collected by the USDA 1977−1978
NFCS. The survey was conducted through interviews
and diary entries. Daily intake rates for tap water and
total water were calculated for various age groups for
males, females, and both sexes combined. Tap water
was defined as “all water from the household tap

February 2019

consumed directly as a beverage or used to prepare
foods and beverages.” Total water was defined as tap
water plus “water intrinsic to foods and beverages”
(i.e., water contained in purchased food and
beverages). The authors showed that the age, sex, and
racial distribution of the surveyed population closely
matched the estimated 1977 U.S. population.
Table 3-29 presents daily total tap water intake
rates, expressed as mL/day by age group. These data
follow a lognormal distribution. Table 3-30 presents
the same data, expressed as mL/kg-day. This shows
that the mean and 90th percentile intake rates for adults
(ages 20 to 65+) are approximately 1,410 mL/day and
2,280 mL/day, and for all ages, the mean and 90th
percentile intake rates are 1,193 mL/day and 2,092
mL/day. Note that older adults have greater intakes
than do adults between ages 20 and 64, an observation
bearing on the interpretation of the Cantor et al. (1987)
study, which surveyed a population that was older than
the national average (see Section 3.3.2.8).
Ershow and Cantor (1989) also measured total
water intake for the same age groups and concluded
that it averaged 2,070 mL/day for all groups combined
and that tap water intake (1,190 mL/day) is 55% of the
total water intake. Table 3-31 presents total tap water
intake as a percentage of total water intake for various
age groups. Ershow and Cantor (1989) also concluded
that, for all age groups combined, the proportion of tap
water consumed as drinking water or used to prepare
foods and beverages is 54, 10, and 36%, respectively.
(Table 3-32 presents the detailed data on the
proportion of tap water consumed for various age
groups). Ershow and Cantor (1989) also observed that
males of all age groups had higher total water and tap
water consumption rates than females; the variation of
each from the combined-sexes mean was about 8%.
With respect to region of the country, the Northeast
had slightly lower average tap water intake
(1,200 mL/day) than the three other regions (which
were approximately equal at 1,400 mL/day).
This survey has an adequately large size
(26,446 individuals), and it is a representative sample
of the U.S. population with respect to age distribution
and residential location. The data, however, are more
than 20 years old and may not be entirely
representative of current patterns of water intake.
3.3.2.7. Roseberry and Burmaster (1992)―
Lognormal Distributions for Water Intake
Roseberry and Burmaster (1992) fit lognormal
distributions to the water intake data population-wide
distributions for total fluid and total tap water intake
based on proportions of the population in each age
group. Their publication shows the data and the fitted

Page 3-16



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
lognormal distributions graphically. The mean was
estimated as the zero intercept, and the standard
deviation (SD) was estimated as the slope of the
best-fit line for the natural logarithm of the intake rates
plotted against their corresponding z-scores
(Roseberry and Burmaster, 1992). Least squares
techniques were used to estimate the best-fit straight
lines for the transformed data. Table 3-33 presents
summary statistics for the best-fit lognormal
distribution. In this table, the simulated balanced
population represents an adjustment to account for the
difference in the age distribution of the U.S.
population in 1988 from the age distribution in 1978
when Ershow and Cantor (1989) collected their data.
Table 3-34 summarizes the quantiles and means of tap
water intake as estimated from the best-fit
distributions. The mean total tap water intake rates for
the two adult populations (ages 20 to 65 years, and
65+ years) were estimated to be 1.27 and 1.34 L/day.
These intake rates were based on the data
originally presented by Ershow and Cantor (1989).
Consequently, the same advantages and disadvantages
associated with the Ershow and Cantor (1989) study
apply to this data set.
3.3.2.8. Levy et al. (1995)―Infant Fluoride Intake
from Drinking Water Added to Formula,
Beverages, and Food
Levy et al. (1995) conducted a study to determine
fluoride intake by infants through drinking water and
other beverages prepared with water and baby foods.
The study was longitudinal and covered the ages from
birth to 9 months old. A total of 192 mothers, recruited
from the postpartum wards of two hospitals in Iowa
City, completed mail questionnaires and 3-day
beverage and food diaries for their infants at ages
6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 9 months (Levy et al., 1995).
The questionnaire addressed feeding habits, water
sources and ingestion, and the use of dietary fluoride
supplements during the preceding week (Levy et al.,
1995). It also collected data on the quantity of water
consumed by itself or as an additive to infant formula,
other beverages, or foods. In addition, the
questionnaire addressed the infants’ ingestion of
cow’s milk, breast milk, ready-to-feed (RTF) infant
products (formula, juices, beverages, baby food), and
table foods.
Mothers were contacted for any clarifications of
missing data and discrepancies (Levy et al., 1995).
Levy et al. (1995) assessed nonresponse bias and
found no significant differences in the reported
number of adults or children in the family, water
sources, or family income at 3, 6, or 9 months.
Table 3-35 provides the range of water ingestion from

February 2019

water by itself and from addition to selected foods and
beverages. The percentage of infants ingesting water
by itself increased from 28% at 6 weeks to 66% at
9 months, respectively, and the mean intake increased
slightly over this time frame. During this time frame,
the largest proportion of the infants’ water ingestion
(i.e., 36% at 9 months to 48% at 6 months) came from
the addition of water to formula. Levy et al. (1995)
noted that 32% of the infants at age 6 weeks and 23%
of the infants at age 3 months did not receive any water
from any of the sources studied. Levy et al. (1995) also
noted that the proportion of children ingesting some
water from all sources gradually increased with age.
The advantages of this study are that it provides
information on water ingestion of infants starting at
6 weeks old, and the data are for water only and for
water added to beverages and foods. The limitations of
the study are that the sample size was small for each
age group, it captured information from a select
geographical location, and data were collected through
self-reporting. The authors noted, however, that the
3-day diary has been shown to be a valid assessment
tool. Levy et al. (1995) also stated that (1) for each
time period, the ages of the infants varied by a few
days to a few weeks, and are, therefore, not exact and
could, at early ages, have an effect on age-specific
intake patterns; and (2) the same number of infants
were not available at each of the four time periods.
3.3.2.9. USDA (1995)―Food and Nutrient Intakes
by Individuals in the United States, 1 Day,
1989−1991
USDA (1995) collected data on the quantity of
“plain drinking water” and various other beverages
consumed by individuals in 1 day during 1989 through
1991. The data were collected as part of USDA’s
CSFII. The data used to estimate mean per capita
intake rates combined 1-day dietary recall data from
3 survey years, 1989, 1990, and 1991, during which
15,128 individuals supplied 1-day intake data.
Individuals from all income levels in the
48 conterminous states and Washington D.C. were
included in the sample. A complex three-stage
sampling design was employed, and the overall
response rate for the study was 58%. To minimize the
biasing effects of the low response rate and adjust for
the seasonality, a series of weighting factors was
incorporated into the data analysis. Table 3-36
presents the intake rates based on this study.
Table 3-36 includes data for (1) “plain drinking
water,” which might be assumed to mean tap water
directly consumed rather than bottled water; (2) coffee
and tea, which might be assumed to be constituted
from tap water; (3) fruit drinks and ades, which might

Page 3-17



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
be assumed to be reconstituted from tap water rather
than canned products; and (4) the total of the three
sources. With these assumptions, the mean per capita
total intake of water is estimated to be 1,416 mL/day
for adult males (i.e., 20 years of age and older),
1,288 mL/day for adult females (i.e., 20 years of age
and older), and 1,150 mL/day for all ages and both
sexes combined. Although these assumptions appear
reasonable, a close reading of the definitions used by
USDA (1995) reveals that the word “tap water” does
not occur, and this uncertainty prevents the use of this
study as a key study of tap water intake.
The advantages of using these data are that (1) the
survey had a large sample size and (2) the authors
attempted to represent the general U.S. population by
oversampling low-income groups and by weighting
the data to compensate for low response rates. The
disadvantages are that (1) the word “tap water” was
not defined, and the assumptions that must be used to
compare the data with the other tap water studies
might not be valid; (2) the data collection period
reflects only a 1-day intake period and may not reflect
long-term drinking water intake patterns; (3) data on
the percentiles of the distribution of intakes were not
given; and (4) the data are almost 20 years old and may
not be entirely representative of current intake
patterns.
3.3.2.10. U.S. EPA (1996)―Descriptive Statistics
from a Detailed Analysis of the National
Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS)
Responses
The U.S. EPA collected information on the number
of glasses of drinking water and juice reconstituted
with tap water consumed by the general population as
part of the National Human Activity Pattern Survey
(NHAPS) (U.S. EPA, 1996). NHAPS was conducted
between October 1992 and September 1994. Over
9,000 individuals in the 48 contiguous United States
provided data on the duration and frequency of
selected activities and the time spent in selected
microenvironments via 24-hour diaries. Over
4,000 NHAPS respondents also provided information
on the number of 8-ounce glasses of water and the
number of 8-ounce glasses of juice reconstituted with
water that they drank during the 24-hour survey period
(see Tables 3-37 and 3-38). The median number of
glasses of tap water consumed was 1−2, and the
median number of glasses of juice with tap water
consumed was 1−2.
For both individuals who drank tap water and
individuals who drank juices reconstituted with tap
water, the number of glasses consumed in a day ranged
from 1 to 20 glasses. The highest percentage of the

February 2019

population (37.1%) who drank tap water, consumed in
the range of 3−5 glasses a day, and the highest
percentage of the population (51.5%) who consumed
juice reconstituted with tap water consumed
1−2 glasses in a day. Based on the assumption that
each glass contained 8 ounces of water (226.4 mL), the
total volume of tap water and juice with tap water
consumed would range from 0.23 L/day (1 glass) to
4.5 L/day (20 glasses) for respondents who drank tap
water. Using the same assumption, the volume of tap
water consumed for the population who consumed
3−5 glasses would be 0.68 L/day to 1.13 L/day, and
the volume of juice with tap water consumed for the
population who consumed 1−2 glasses would be
0.23−0.46 L/day. Assuming the average individual
consumes 3−5 glasses of tap water plus 1−2 glasses of
juice with tap water, the range of total tap water intake
for this individual would range from 0.9 L/day to
1.64 L/day. These values are consistent with the
average intake rates observed in other studies.
The advantages of NHAPS are that the data were
collected for a large number of individuals and that the
data are representative of the U.S. population.
However, evaluation of drinking water intake rates
was not the primary purpose of the study, and the data
do not reflect the total volume of tap water consumed.
In addition, using the assumptions described above,
the estimated drinking water intake rates from this
study are within the same ranges observed for other
drinking water studies.
3.3.2.11. Heller et al. (2000)―Water Consumption
and Nursing Characteristics of Infants by
Race and Ethnicity
Heller et al. (2000) analyzed data from the
1994−1996 CSFII to evaluate racial/ethnic differences
in the ingestion rates of water in children younger than
2 years old. Using data from 946 children in this age
group, the mean amounts of water consumed from
eight sources were determined for various
racial/ethnic groups, including black non-Hispanic,
white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and “other” (Asian,
Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native,
and other nonspecified racial/ethnic groups). The
sources analyzed included (1) plain tap water, (2) milk
and milk drinks, (3) reconstituted powdered or liquid
infant formula made from drinking water,
(4) ready-to-feed and other infant formula, (5) baby
food, (6) carbonated beverages, (7) fruit and vegetable
juices and other noncarbonated drinks, and (8) other
foods and beverages. In addition, Heller et al. (2000)
calculated mean plain water and total water ingestion
rates for children by age, sex, region, urbanicity, and
poverty category. Ages were defined as less than

Page 3-18



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
12 months and 12 to 24 months. Regions were
categorized as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.
Heller et al. (2000) did not report the states represented
by each of these regions, but it is likely that they
defined these regions in the same way Sohn et al.
(2001) did. See Section 3.6.1.3 for a discussion on
the Sohn et al. (2001) study. Urbanicity of the
residence was defined as urban (i.e., being in a
metropolitan statistical area [MSA], suburban
[outside of an MSA], or rural [being in a non-MSA]).
Poverty category was derived from the poverty
income ratio. In this study, a poverty income ratio
was calculated by dividing the family’s annual
income by the federal poverty threshold for that
size household. The poverty categories used were 0
−1.30, 1.31−3.50, and greater than 3.50 times the
federal poverty level (Heller et al., 2000).
Table 3-39 provides water ingestion estimates for
the eight water sources evaluated, for each of the
race/ethnic groups. Heller et al. (2000) reported that
black non-Hispanic children had the highest mean
plain tap water intake (21 mL/kg-day), and white
non-Hispanic children had the lowest mean plain tap
water intake (13 mL/kg-day). The only statistically
significant difference between the racial/ethnic groups
was found to be in plain tap water consumption and
total water consumption. Reconstituted baby formula
made up the highest proportion of total water intake
for all race/ethnic groups. Table 3-40 presents tap
water and total water ingestion by age, sex, region,
urbanicity, and poverty category. On average, children
younger than 12 months of age consumed less plain
tap water (11 mL/kg-day) than children aged
12−24 months (18 mL/kg-day). There were no
significant differences in plain tap water consumption
by sex, region, or urbanicity. Heller et al. (2000)
reported a significant association between higher
income and lower plain tap water consumption. For
total water consumption, ingestion per kg body weight
was lower for the 12- to 24-month-old children than
for those younger than 12 months of age. Urban
children consumed more plain tap water and total
water than suburban and rural children. In addition,
plain tap water and total water ingestion was found to
decrease with increasing poverty category (i.e., higher
wealth).
A major strength of the Heller et al. (2000) study
is that it provides information on tap water and total
water consumption by race, age, sex, region,
urbanicity, and family income. A weakness in the
CSFII data set is that is that it includes data collected
over only 2 days that may not be entirely
representative of long-term intake.

3.3.2.12. Marshall et al. (2003a)―Patterns of
Beverage
Consumption
during
the
Transition Stage of Infant Nutrition
Marshall et al. (2003a) investigated beverage
ingestion during the transition stage of infant nutrition.
Mean ingestion of infant formula, cow’s milk,
combined juice and juice drinks, water, and other
beverages was estimated using a frequency
questionnaire. A total of 701 children, aged 6 months
through 24 months, participated in the Iowa Fluoride
Study (IFS). Mothers of newborns were recruited from
1992 through 1995. The parents were sent
questionnaires when the children were 6, 9, 12, 16, 20,
and 24 months old. Of the 701 children, 470 returned
all six questionnaires, 162 returned five, 58 returned
four, and 11 returned three, with the minimum criteria
being three questionnaires to be included in the data
set (Marshall et al., 2003a). The questionnaire was
designed to assess the type and quantity of the
beverages consumed during the previous week. The
validity of the questionnaire was assessed using a
3-day food diary for reference (Marshall et al., 2003a).
Table 3-41 presents the percentage of subjects
consuming beverages and mean daily beverage
ingestion for children with returned questionnaires.
Human milk ingestion was not quantified, but the
percent of children consuming human milk was
provided at each age category (see Table 3-41). Juice
(100%) and juice drinks were not distinguished
separately but categorized as juice and juice drinks.
Water used to dilute beverages beyond normal dilution
and water consumed alone were combined. Based on
Table 3-41, 97% of the children consumed human
milk, formula, or cow’s milk throughout the study
period, and the percentage of infants consuming
human milk decreased with age, while the percent
consuming water increased (Marshall et al., 2003a).
Marshall et al. (2003a) observed that, in general, lower
family incomes were associated with less
breast-feeding and increased ingestion of other
beverages.
The advantage of this study is that it provides mean
ingestion data for various beverages. Limitations of
the study are that it is based on samples gathered in
one geographical area and may not be reflective of the
general population. The authors also noted the
following limitations: the parents were not asked to
differentiate between 100% juice and juice drinks; the
data are parent-reported and could reflect perceptions
of appropriate ingestion instead of actual ingestion,
and a substantial number of the infants from
well-educated, economically secure households
dropped out during the initial phase.

3.3.2.13. Marshall
et
al.
(2003b)―Relative
Validation of a Beverage Frequency
Questionnaire in Children Aged 6 Months
through 5 Years Using 3-Day Food and
Beverage Diaries
Marshall et al. (2003b) conducted a study based on
data taken from 700 children in the IFS. This study
compared estimated beverage ingestion rates reported
in questionnaires for the preceding week and diaries
for the following week. Packets were sent periodically
(every 4 to 6 months) to parents of children aged
6 weeks through 5 years of age. This study analyzed
data from children, aged 6 and 12 months, and 2 and
5 years of age. Beverages were categorized as human
milk, infant formula, cow’s milk, juice and juice
drinks, carbonated and rehydration beverages,
prepared drinks (from powder), and water. The
beverage questionnaire was completed by parents and
summarized the average amount of each beverage
consumed per day by their children. The data
collection for the diaries maintained by parents
included 1 weekend day and 2 weekdays and included
detailed information about beverages consumed.
Table 3-42 presents the mean ingestion rates of all
beverages for children aged 6 and 12 months and 3 and
5 years. Marshall et al. (2003b) concluded that
estimates of beverage ingestion derived from
quantitative questionnaires are similar to those derived
from diaries. They found that it is particularly useful
to estimate ingestion of beverages consumed
frequently using quantitative questionnaires.
The advantage of this study is that the survey was
conducted in two different forms (questionnaire and
diary) and that diaries for recording beverage ingestion
were maintained by parents for 3 days. The main
limitation is the lack of information on whether the
diaries were populated on consecutive or
nonconsecutive days. The IFS survey participants may
not be representative of the general population of the
United States because participants were primarily
white, and from affluent and well-educated families in
one geographic region of the country.
3.3.2.14. Skinner et al. (2004)―Transition in
Infants’ and Toddlers’ Beverage Patterns
Skinner et al. (2004) investigated the pattern of
beverage consumption by infants and children
participating in the Feeding Infant and Toddlers Study
(FITS) sponsored by Gerber Products Company. The
FITS is a cross-sectional study designed to collect and
analyze data on feeding practices, food consumption,
and usual nutrient intake of U.S. infants and toddlers
(Devaney et al., 2004). It included a stratified random
sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers between 4 and

February 2019

24 months of age. Parents or primary caregivers of
sampled infants and toddlers completed a single
24-hour dietary recall of all foods and beverages
consumed by the child on the previous day by
telephone interview. All recalls were completed
between March and July 2002. Detailed information
on data collection, coding, and analyses related to
FITS is provided in Devaney et al. (2004).
Beverages consumed by FITS participants were
identified as total milks (i.e., human milk, infant
formulas, cow’s milk, soy milk, goat’s milk), 100%
juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and
“other” drinks (i.e., tea, cocoa, dry milk mixtures, and
electrolyte replacement beverages). There were six
age groupings in the FITS study: 4 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 11,
12 to 14, 15 to 18, and 19 to 24 months. Skinner et al.
(2004) calculated the percentage of children in each
age group consuming any amount in a beverage
category and the mean amounts consumed. Table 3-43
provides the mean beverage consumption rates in
mL/day for the six age categories. Skinner et al. (2004)
found that some form of milk beverage was consumed
by almost all children at each age; however, total milk
ingestion decreased with increasing age. Water
consumption also doubled with age, from 163 mL/day
in children aged 4 to 6 months old to 337 mL/day in
children aged 19 to 24 months old. The percentages of
children consuming water increased from 34% at 4 to
6 months of age to 77% at 19 to 24 months of age.
A major strength of the Skinner et al. (2004) study
is the large sample size (3,022 children). However,
beverage ingestion estimates are based on 1 day of
dietary recall data and human milk quantity derived
from studies that weighed infants before and after each
feeding to determine the quantity of human milk
consumed (Devaney et al., 2004); therefore, estimates
of total milk ingestion may not be accurate.
3.3.2.15. Barraj et al. (2009)―Within-Day Drinking
Water Consumption Patterns: Results from
a Drinking Water Consumption Study
In 2000/2001, Barraj et al. (2009) conducted a
Drinking Water Consumption Survey (DWCS),
funded by Bayer Crop Science, to generate data that
could be used to assess acute effects of exposures
lasting less than 24 hours. The objective of the study
was to determine how often and how much water
participants ingested during the day. Data for a
nationally representative sample of the U.S.
population were collected over 7-day periods during
both summer (August) and winter (March) months.
The study participants were selected from households
within Bayer’s Home Testing Institute consumer
panel, and diaries were delivered to 3,000 randomly

Page 3-20



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
selected households in summer, and 3,650 households
in winter. The response rates were 33 and 36%,
respectively, for the summer and winter surveys, with
994 households completing the summer survey, and
1,320 households completing the winter survey. After
excluding diaries with missing or incorrect data, the
final data set represented 4,198 individuals (1,740 in
summer) and 2,458 in winter). The vast majority of
participants were white (90.2% for summer and winter
combined), and males and females above the age of 50
years accounted for the largest portion of participants
(34.5%). Teenage males and females accounted for the
smallest percentage of participants (6.7%), and
children accounted for approximately 13% of the
survey population. Each survey participant was asked
to complete a diary to provide details about their water
consumption patterns over a 7-day period. Using the
diary data for a randomly selected day for each survey
participant, the average number of drinking occasions
per day, the average amount consumed per drinking
occasion, and the average amount of water consumed
per day was determined for each sex and age group for
each season (see Table 3-44).
For all sex and age groups combined, there were
slightly more daily drinking occasions reported for
summer (mean of 4.4) than winter (mean of 4.1), and
the average amount consumed per drinking occasion
was slightly higher in the summer (266 mL/event)
compared to the winter (248 mL/event). Based on one
randomly selected day for each survey participant,
mean daily water intake was higher for summer
(1,141 mL/day; N = 1,740) than for winter
(1,023 mL/day; N = 2,458). Based on all survey days
and all participants (N = 27,192 person-days), the
mean drinking water intake rate for both seasons
combined, was 1,118 mL/day, and the 95th percentile
was 2,957 mL/day. The mean and 95th percentile
intakes rates were 1,200 and 3,194 mL/day,
respectively, for summer (N = 11,318 person-days),
and 1,056 and 2,780 mL/day, respectively, for winter
(N = 15,874 person-days).
This study was based on a large, nationally
representative sample of the U.S. population, and
provided data by season. Also, it provided information
on the amount of water consumed per event within a
24-hour period, and data were provided by sex and
age. The limitations of this study are that hourly time
increments and 2-ounce amount increments were used
in collecting the diary data. These factors may
contribute to uncertainties regarding the exact
consumption times and the exact amounts consumed.

February 2019

3.3.2.16. Zizza et al. (2009)―Total Water Intakes of
Community-Living
Middle-Old
and
Oldest-Old Adults
Zizza et al. (2009) used data from NHANES
1999−2002 to estimate total water intake among older
Americans, defined as respondents 65 years of age or
older (N = 2,054). Intake was estimated as g/day and
as g/body weight/day. Total water was defined as “the
sum of the amount of drinking water consumed and
the amount of water consumed from food and
beverage sources.” The relative contributions of total
water intake that was derived from plain drinking
water, beverages, and food were also calculated. Total
water intake was estimated for three age groups of
older survey respondents: young-old (65 to <75 years),
middle-old (75 to <85 years), and oldest-old (85+
years). Table 3-45 provides the estimates of total water
intake for these three age groups. Zizza et al. (2009)
reported that total water intake rates for the middle-old
and oldest-old groups were significantly lower than for
the young-old group. Plain drinking water accounted
for 38.1, 39.4, and 39.5% of total water intake for the
young-old, middle-old, and oldest-old age groups
respectively. Beverages accounted for 40.8, 38.3, and
36.4% of total water intake and food accounted for
21.1, 22.2, and 24.2% of total water intake for the
same three age groups respectively.
This study provides information for a nationally
representative population of older Americans.
However, the water categories are somewhat different
from those used elsewhere in this chapter. For
example, plain water category appears to include both
tap water and bottled water. Likewise, water from
beverages may include both water that is intrinsic to
purchased beverages (i.e., widely distributed drinks
such as carbonated soft drinks) as well as beverages
that are prepared with community tap water.
3.3.2.17. Sebastian et al. (2011)―Drinking Water
Intake in the United States; Rosinger et al.
(2016)―Daily Water Intake among U.S.
Men and Women, 2009−2012
Sebastian et al. (2011) investigated “plain water”
intake using data from NHANES 2005−2008. “Plain
water” was defined as “tap water and noncarbonated
bottled water without sweeteners or other additions.
[It] does not include water naturally present in or
added as an ingredient to other beverages or foods.”
The study authors observed that plain water accounted
for approximately one-third of the total water
consumed (i.e., total water was defined as plain water
plus water contained in foods and beverages).
Approximately 69% of plain water was consumed at
home and 31% was consumed away from home.

Page 3-21



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
Sebastian et al. (2011) also found that tap water
consumed at home accounted for 46% of the plain
water consumed; 16% of plain water was tap water
consumed away from home. Bottled water consumed
at home accounted for 23% of plain water intake, and
bottled water consumed away from home accounted
for 16% of plain water intake. Using NHANES
2009−2012, Rosinger et al. (2016) estimated that plain
water accounted for 30% of total water intake for mean
and 34% of total intake for women.
These studies provide general information about
plain and total water intake in the United States. The
Sebastian et al. (2011) data are provided in units of
cups/day. The Rosinger et al. (2016) study provides
data in units of L/day, but for mean total water only,
not distributions.
3.3.2.18. Kahn and Stralka (2009)―Estimated Daily
Average per Capita Water Ingestion by
Child and Adult Age Categories Based on
USDA’s 1994−1996 and 1998 Continuing
Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and
Supplemental Data, Kahn (2008)
Kahn and Stralka (2009) analyzed the combined
1994−1996 and 1998 CSFII data sets to examine water
ingestion rates of more than 20,000 individuals
surveyed, including approximately 10,000 under age
21 and 9,000 under age 11. Previous CSFII analyses
conducted using the 1994−1996 data sets were
reported in U.S. EPA (2000b). USDA surveyed
households in the United States and District of
Columbia and collected food and beverage recall data
as part of the CSFII (USDA, 1998). Data were
collected by an in-home interviewer. The Day 2
interview was conducted 3 to 10 days later and on a
different day of the week. Each individual in the
survey was assigned a sample weight based on his or
her demographic data. These weights were taken into
account when calculating mean and percentile water
ingestion rates from various sources. Kahn and Stralka
(2009) derived mean and percentile estimates of daily
average water ingestion for the following age
categories: <1 month, 1 to <3 months, 3 to <6 months,
6 to <12 months, 1 to <2 years of age, 2 to <3 years,
3 to <6 years, 6 to <11 years, 11 to <16 years, 16 to
<18 years, 18 to <21 years of age, 21 years and older,
65 years and older, and all ages. The increased sample
size for children younger than 11 years of age (from
4,339 in the initial 1994−1996 survey to
9,643 children in the combined 1994−1996, 1998
survey) enabled water ingestion estimates to be
categorized into the finer age categories recommended
by U.S. EPA (2005). Consumer-only and per capita
water ingestion estimates were reported in the Kahn

February 2019

and Stralka (2009) study for two water source
categories: all sources and community water. “All
sources” included water from all supply sources such
as community water supply (i.e., tap water), bottled
water, other sources, and missing sources.
“Community water” included tap water from a
community or municipal water supply. Other sources
included wells, springs, and cisterns; missing sources
represented water sources that the survey respondent
was unable to identify. The water ingestion estimates
included both water ingested directly as a beverage
(direct water) and water added to foods and beverages
during final preparation at home or by local food
service establishments such as school cafeterias and
restaurants (indirect water). Commercial water added
by a manufacturer (i.e., water contained in soda or
beer) and intrinsic water in foods and liquids (i.e., milk
and natural undiluted juice) were not included in the
estimates. Kahn and Stralka (2009) only reported the
mean and 90th and 95th percentile estimates of per
capita and consumers-only ingestion. The full
distributions of ingestion estimates were provided by
the author (Kahn, 2008). Tables 3-46 to 3-61 present
full distributions of direct and indirect water intake for
the various water source categories (community water,
bottled water, other sources, and all sources).
Tables 3-46 to 3-49 provide per capita ingestion
estimates of total water (combined direct and indirect
water) in mL/day for the various water source
categories (i.e., community, bottled, other, and all
sources). Tables 3-50 to 3-53 present the same
information as Tables 3-46 to 3-49, but in units of
mL/kg-day. Tables 3-54 to 3-57 provide
consumers-only combined direct and indirect water
ingestion estimates in mL/day for the various source
categories. Tables 3-58 to 3-61 present the same
information as Tables 3-54 to 3-57 but in units of
mL/kg-day. Estimates that do not meet the minimum
sample size requirements as described in the Joint
Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical
Reporting Standards on NHANES III and CSFII
Reports: NHIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group
Recommendations (NCHS, 1993) are flagged in the
tables.
The CSFII 1994−1996, 1998 data have both
strengths and limitations in regard to estimating water
ingestion. These are discussed in detail in U.S. EPA
(2004) and Kahn and Stralka (2009). The principal
advantages of this survey are that (1) it was designed
to be representative of the U.S. population, including
children and low-income groups; (2) sample weights
were provided that facilitated proper analysis of the
data and accounted for nonresponse; and (3) the
number of individuals sampled (more than 20,000) is
sufficient to allow categorization within narrowly

Page 3-22



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
defined age categories. Another advantage is that
bottled water estimates include both direct and indirect
intake, whereas the bottled water estimates using
NHANES 2005−2010 data (see Section 3.3.1.1)
include only bottled water consumed directly as a
beverage; they do not include bottled water used in the
preparation of foods. One limitation of this survey is
that data were collected for only 2 days. As discussed
in Section 3.3.1.1 in regard to U.S. EPA’s analysis of
NHANES data, short-term data may not accurately
reflect long-term intake patterns, especially at the
extremes (i.e., tails) of the distribution of water intake.
This study is considered relevant because more recent
data are available from NHANES 2005−2010.
3.4. PREGNANT AND LACTATING WOMEN
3.4.1. Key Study on Pregnant and Lactating
Women
The section that follows provides a summary of the
key study on water ingestion among pregnant and
lactating women.
3.4.1.1. EPA Analysis of Consumption Data from
2005−2010 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey
EPA estimated water intake rates for pregnant,
lactating, and all women of child-bearing age (13 to
<50 years) using data from the NHANES for the years
2005 to 2010 and the FCID Consumption Calculator
available at http://fcid.foodrisk.org/, as described in
Section 3.3.1.1. NHANES 2005−2010 collected data
on dietary recall of food and water consumed over the
previous 24-hour period on 2 nonconsecutive days.
Two-day data were available for 426 pregnant women,
101 lactating women, and 5,543 women of
child-bearing age. In the FCID, NHANES data on the
foods people reported eating were converted to the
quantities of agricultural commodities eaten, including
water that was added in the preparation of foods and
beverages. Two-day average intake rates were
calculated for each survey respondent for community
water, bottled water, other water, and all water
sources. Summary statistics were calculated for the
populations of pregnant, lactating, and females of
child-bearing age (i.e., 13 to <50 years) on both a
consumer-only and on a per capita basis. Table 3-62
provides summary statistics for per capita intake of
water, and Table 3-63 provides the same data on a
consumer-only basis.
As indicated in Section 3.3.1.1, an advantage of
using the EPA’s analysis of NHANES data is it was
designed to be representative of the U.S. population.
The data set used in this analysis used 6 years of intake
data combined. However, the sample sizes for

February 2019

pregnant and lactating women were relatively small
and short-term dietary data may not accurately reflect
long-term eating or drinking patterns and may
under-represent infrequent consumers of a given food.
This is particularly true for the tails (extremes) of the
food-intake distribution.
3.4.2.

Relevant Studies on Pregnant and
Lactating Women
The sections that follow provide summaries of
relevant studies on water ingestion among pregnant
and lactating women.
3.4.2.1. Ershow et al. (1991)―Intake of Tap Water
and Total Water by Pregnant and Lactating
Women
Ershow et al. (1991) used data from the 1977−1978
USDA NFCS to estimate total fluid and total tap water
intake among pregnant and lactating women (ages
15−49 years). Data for 188 pregnant women,
77 lactating women, and 6,201 nonpregnant,
nonlactating control women were evaluated. The
participants were interviewed based on 24-hour recall
and then asked to record a food diary for the next
2 days. “Tap water” included tap water consumed
directly as a beverage and tap water used to prepare
food and tap water-based beverages. “Total water”
was defined as all water from tap water and nontap
water sources, including water contained in food.
Tables 3-64 and 3-65 present estimated total fluid and
total tap water intake rates for the three groups,
respectively. Lactating women had the highest mean
total fluid intake rate (2.24 L/day) compared with both
pregnant women (2.08 L/day) and control women
(1.94 L/day). Lactating women also had a higher mean
total tap water intake rate (1.31 L/day) than pregnant
women (1.19 L/day) and control women (1.16 L/day).
The tap water distributions are neither normal nor
lognormal, but lactating women had a higher mean tap
water intake than controls and pregnant women.
Ershow et al. (1991) also reported that rural women
(N = 1,885) consumed more total water (1.99 L/day)
and tap water (1.24 L/day) than urban/suburban
women (N = 4,581, 1.93 and 1.13 L/day, respectively).
Total water and tap water intake rates were lowest in
the northeastern region of the United States (1.82 and
1.03 L/day) and highest in the western region of the
United States (2.06 L/day and 1.21 L/day). Mean
intake per unit body weight was highest among
lactating women for both total fluid and total tap water
intake. Total tap water intake accounted for over 50%
of mean total fluid in all three groups of women
(see Table 3-65). Drinking water accounted for the
largest single proportion of the total fluid intake for

Page 3-23



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
control (30%), pregnant (34%), and lactating women
(30%) (see Table 3-66). All other beverages combined
accounted for approximately 46, 43, and 45% of the
total water intake for control, pregnant, and lactating
women, respectively. Food accounted for the
remaining portion of total water intake.
The same advantages and limitations associated
with the Ershow and Cantor (1989) data also apply to
these data sets (see Section 3.3.2.6). A further
advantage of this study is that it provides information
on estimates of total water and tap water intake rates
for pregnant and lactating women. This topic has
rarely been addressed in the literature.
3.4.2.2. Shimokura et al. (1998)―Assessment of
Water Use for Estimating Exposure to Tap
Water Contaminants
Shimokura et al. (1998) evaluated water use
among 34 pregnant women and 33 of their male
partners living in North Carolina. The women were up
to 30 weeks pregnant at the time that the survey was
conducted. Most of the women were in their twenties
and thirties, were expecting their first child, and were
in their second trimester of pregnancy. Approximately
three quarters of the women were white and the
remainder were of African American and Asian.
ethnicities They tended to be highly educated and
nonsmokers. Each of the participants completed a
daily diary for 3 days, including one nonworking or
weekend day, and an interview about their daily water
consumption. Information was collected on the
volume of all beverages consumed, which was defined
as total water, and the volume of drinking water and
beverages made with tap water, which was defined as
tap water. The temperature of the beverage (i.e., cold
or hot), as well as the location where the beverage was
consumed, was also recorded. Table 3-67 provides
summary statistics for the participants’ daily water
intake. Daily consumption of total water and tap water
were similar for pregnant women and men, but
differences based on employment status were
observed for daily intake of cold tap water at home.
Table 3-68 provides mean intake rates for pregnant
women and men according to location, beverage type,
and temperature.
This study provides useful information on daily tap
water intake for pregnant women. However, the
definition of total water differs from that used
elsewhere in this chapter (i.e., the water content of
foods is not included). Also, the study population is
relatively small and may not be entirely representative
of the U.S. population.

February 2019

3.4.2.3. Zender et al. (2001)―Exposure to Tap
Water during Pregnancy
Zender et al. (2001) conducted a study in Colorado
in 1996 and 1997 to compare tap water intake among
pregnant and nonpregnant women. A total of
71 pregnant and 43 nonpregnant women were
recruited from Women, Infant, and Children (WIC)
clinics. Nearly one-half of the pregnant women were
in their second trimester, and one-quarter were in each
of the first and third trimesters. Approximately
one-half of the women worked outside the home, and
nearly all the women had a municipal water source at
their home. The women were interviewed in person or
by phone and responded to questions about the amount
of tap water intake in a day―including the amount
consumed at home and at work. Total tap water intake
included tap water consumed directly as a beverage
and tap water-based cold and hot beverages.
Information on the sources of the water consumed
(e.g., tap water, bottled water, or filtered water) were
also collected. Total tap water intake was slightly
higher for pregnant women (3.4 L/day) than
nonpregnant women (3.0 L/day) (see Table 3-69).
Table 3-70 shows the principal source of drinking
water for pregnant and for nonpregnant women. Tap
water accounted for 72−75% of total water intake.
The advantage of this study is that it investigated
tap water consumption based on location (i.e., at home
and at work) and by source (i.e., bottled, filtered, or
tap water). However, the sample size was small and
the study population may not be representative of the
entire United States.
3.4.2.4. Forssén et al. (2007)―Predictors of Use
and Consumption of Public Drinking Water
among Pregnant Women; Forssén et al.
(2009)―Variability and Predictors of
Changes in Water Use during Pregnancy
Forssén et al. (2007) evaluated the demographic
and behavioral characteristics that would be important
in predicting water consumption among pregnant
women in the United States. Data were collected
through telephone interviews with 2,297 pregnant
women in three geographical areas in the southern
United States. Women 18 years old and ≤12 weeks
pregnant were recruited from the local communities
and from both private and public prenatal care
facilities. Variables studied included demographic
characteristics, health status and history (e.g., diabetes,
pregnancy history), behavioral patterns (e.g., exercise,
smoking, caffeine consumption), and some
physiological characteristics (e.g., prepregnancy
weight). Daily amount of water ingestion was
estimated based on cup sizes defined in the interview.

Page 3-24



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
Water consumption was reported as cold tap water
(filtered and unfiltered) and bottled water. Other
behavioral information on water use such as
showering and bathing habits, use of swimming pools,
hot tubs, and Jacuzzis was also collected. The overall
mean cold tap water ingested was 1.7 L/day
(percentiles: 25th = 0.5 L/day, 50th = 1.4 L/day,
75th = 2.4 L/day, and 90th = 3.8 L/day). The overall
mean bottled water ingested was 0.6 L/day
(percentiles: 25th = 0.1 L/day, 50th = 0.2 L/day,
75th = 0.6 L/day, and 90th = 1.8 L/day). Table 3-71
presents water ingestion by the different variables
studied, and Table 3-72 presents the percentage of
ingested tap water that is filtered and unfiltered by
various variables.
Forssén et al. (2009) studied changes in water use
over the course of pregnancy based on data for
1,990 women that were still pregnant during a second
interview. Mean cold tap water intake increased from
prepregnancy (1.5 L/day) though early pregnancy
(1.7 L/day) to
mid-pregnancy (1.8 L/day)
(see Table 3-73). Mean hot tap water intake decreased
slightly from prepregnancy (0.18 L/day) to early and
mid-pregnancy (0.16 L/day). Bottled water intake was
essentially the same during early and mid-pregnancy
(0.57 and 0.59 L/day, respectively). The greatest
changes in water consumption were reported for cold
tap water where 80% of the women reported either
increases or decreases in consumption; 33% reported
changes (increases or decreases) equal to or greater
than 1.0 L/day (see Table 3-74).
The advantage of these studies is that they
investigated water consumption in relation to multiple
variables, and over the course of pregnancy. However,
the study population was not random and may not be
representative of the entire United States. There may
also be limitations associated with recall bias.
3.4.2.5. Kahn and Stralka (2008)―Estimates of
Water Ingestion for Women in Pregnant,
Lactating,
and
Nonpregnant
and
Nonlactating Child-Bearing Age Groups
Based on USDA’s 1994−1996, 1998 CSFII
The combined 1994−1996 and 1998 CSFII data
sets were analyzed to examine the ingestion of water
by various segments of the U.S. population as
described in Section 3.3.1.1. Kahn and Stralka (2008)
provided water intake data for pregnant, lactating, and
child-bearing age women. Mean and upper percentile
distribution data were provided. Lactating women had
an estimated per capita mean community water
ingestion of 1.38 L/day, the highest water ingestion
rates of any among the population evaluated. The
mean consumer-only rate was 1.67 L/day. Tables 3-75

February 2019

through 3-82 provide estimated drinking water intakes
for pregnant and lactating women, and nonpregnant,
nonlactating women aged 15−44 years old. The same
advantages
and
limitations
discussed
in
Section 3.3.1.1 apply to these data. An additional
limitation of this analysis is that the sample size was
relatively small (i.e., 70 pregnant and 41 lactating
women). This study is considered relevant, but not key
because more recent data are available for pregnant
and lactating women.
3.5. FORMULA-FED INFANTS
3.5.1. Key Study on Formula-Fed Infants
The section that follows provides a summary of the
key study on water ingestion among formula-fed
infants.
3.5.1.1. Kahn et al. (2013)―Estimates of Water
Ingestion in Formula by Infants and
Children Based on USDA’s 1994−1996 and
1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by
Individuals
Kahn et al. (2013) used data from the 1994−1996
and 1998 CSFII to estimate water ingestion among
formula-fed infants, ages <1 month, 1 to <3 months,
3 to <6 months, 6 to <12 months, and 1 to <2 years.
The same methodology was used as in Kahn and
Stralka (2009), as described in Section 3.3.2.18.
Indirect water ingestion among “formula-consumers
only” was based on the estimated amount of
community water used to reconstitute or dilute infant
formula. Total indirect and direct water intake among
formula-fed infants represented both water used to
reconstitute or dilute baby formula and water
consumed directly as a beverage. Mean and 95th
percentile indirect, and total indirect and direct water
ingestion rates for formula-consuming infants are
provided in Table 3-83. On a mL/day basis, mean
intake rates increased between <1 month and 3 to
<6 months and then declined; on a mL/kg-day basis,
mean intake declined from <1 month to 1 to <2 years.
The same advantages and disadvantages discussed
in Section 3.3.2.18 apply to these data. In addition, as
suggested by Kahn et al. (2013), while the more recent
data may be available (e.g., NHANES) for this type of
analysis, the amount of water ingested by formula-fed
infants would not be expected to change significantly
because the nutritional needs of infants would not be
expected to have varied over time.
3.5.2. Relevant Studies on Formula-Fed Infants
The section that follows provides summaries of the
relevant studies on water ingestion among formula-fed
infants. Sections 3.3.2.8 (Levy et al., 1995), 3.3.2.11

Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
(Heller et al., 2000), and 3.3.2.12 (Marshall et al.,

ingestion of water used in reconstituting infant
formula.
et
al.
(2002)―Measured
3.5.2.1. Hilbig
Consumption of Tap Water in German
Infants and Young Children as Background
for Potential Health Risk Assessment: Data
of the DONALD Study
Hilbig et al. (2002) estimated tap water ingestion
rates based on 3-day dietary records of 504 German
children aged 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. The
data were collected between 1990 and 1998 as part of
the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric
Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study. The
DONALD study was a cohort study that collected data
on diet, metabolism, growth, and development from
healthy subjects between infancy and adulthood
(Sichert-Hellert et al., 2001). Beginning in 1985,
approximately 40 to 50 infants were enrolled in the
study annually. Mothers of the participants were
recruited in hospital maternity wards. Tap water
ingestion rates were calculated for three subgroups of
children: (1) breast-fed infants ≤12 months of age
(exclusive
and
partial
breast-fed
infants),
(2) formula-fed infants ≤12 months of age (no human
milk, but including weaning food), and (3) mixed-fed
young children aged 18 to 36 months. Hilbig et al.
(2002) defined “total tap water from household” as
water from the tap consumed as a beverage or used in
food preparation. “Tap water from food
manufacturing” was defined as water used in industrial
production of foods, and “Total Tap Water” was
defined as tap water consumed from both the
household and that used in manufacturing.
Table 3-84 summarizes total tap water ingestion
(in mL/day and mL/kg-day) and tap water ingestion
from household and manufacturing sources (in
mL/kg-day) for breast-fed, formula-fed, and
mixed-fed children. Mean total tap water intake during
the 1st year of life was higher in formula-fed infants
(53 mL/kg-day) than in breast-fed infants
(17 mL/kg-day) and mixed-fed young children
(19 mL/kg-day). Tap water from household sources
constituted 66 to 97% of total tap water ingestion in
the different age groups.
The major limitation of this study is that the study
sample consists of families from an upper social
background in Germany (Hilbig et al., 2002). Because
the study was conducted in Germany, the data may not
be directly applicable to the U.S. population.
However, this study was included in this chapter

February 2019

because similar data for a U.S. population of infants
are limited.
3.5.2.2. Levallois et al. (2008)―Drinking Water
Intake by Infants Living in Rural Quebec
(Canada)
Levallois et al. (2008) conducted a survey on a
population of 2-month-old infants residing in seven
agricultural areas of Canada. Eligible newborns were
born in this rural area of Quebec between January and
April 2002. Infants who were less than 34 weeks of
gestation at birth, families who did not speak French,
or those served by surface water supplies were
excluded from the study. Families who were eligible
for participation were sent a letter explaining the
survey followed by a phone interview with the infant’s
mother. There were 642 mothers who participated in
the survey, which was conducted when the infants
were 8−9 weeks old. Questions asked during the phone
interview included those on feeding practices such as
the quantity and number of feedings each day and the
specific type and volume of water used for preparing
formula, juices, or cereals. Of the 642 participating
infants, 38.3% were exclusively breast-fed and,
therefore, had no drinking water intake. Almost half of
the participating infants (47.5%) were fed either
ready-to-use formula or dry formula mixed with water,
and 14.2% received mixed breast and formula
feedings. Infants who consumed some water
comprised 61.2% of the participants, and among these
59, 34, and 7% consumed mostly tap water, bottled
water, or both tap and bottled water, respectively. For
consumers, mean tap water intake was 564 mL/day
(105 mL/kg-day) and mean bottled water intake was
504 mL/day (94 mL/kg/day) (see Table 3-85).
This study provides quantitative estimates of
drinking water consumption by a population of
2-month-old infants according to their feeding
practices. Limitations of the study include the fact that
drinking water intake was not measured, but was
provided by the infants’ mothers during telephone
interviews. Although the participants resided in rural
areas of Canada, which may not be entirely
representative of the U.S. population, it is assumed
that drinking water intake for formula-fed infants
would be similar to that of those in the United States.
Therefore, Levallois et al. (2008) was included here as
a relevant study.
3.5.2.3. Schier et al. (2010)―Perchlorate Exposure
from Infant Formula and Comparisons with
the Perchlorate Reference Dose
Schier et al. (2010) estimated perchlorate
exposures among 1- and 6-month-old infants
consuming reconstituted powdered infant formula,

Page 3-26



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
using measured concentrations of perchlorate in the
formula and estimated formula intake rates. Infant
formula ingestion rates were estimated as the product
of average infant energy intakes in kcal/kg-day and
estimated infant body weights, divided by the
estimated number of calories in the infant formula in
kcal/L formula. The estimated 50th percentile formula
intake rate was estimated to be 0.7 L/day for
1-month-old infants and 1.0 L/day for 6-month-old
infants. The estimated 90th percentile formula intake
rate was estimated to be 1.0 L/day for 1-month-old
infants and 1.4 L/day for 6-month-old infants. This
study provides an indirect estimate of water intake
among formula-fed infants.
3.6.

HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS/HOT
CLIMATES
3.6.1. Relevant Studies on High Activity
Levels/Hot Climates
The following sections provide summaries of
relevant studies on water ingestion associated with
various activity levels and climates.
3.6.1.1. McNall and Schlegel (1968)―Practical
Thermal Environmental Limits for Young
Adult Males Working in Hot, Humid
Environments
McNall and Schlegel (1968) conducted a study that
evaluated the physiological tolerance of adult males
working under varying degrees of physical activity.
Subjects were required to operate pedal-driven
propeller fans for 8-hour work cycles under varying
environmental conditions. The activity pattern for
each individual was cycled as 15 minutes of pedaling
and 15 minutes of rest for each 8-hour period. Two
groups of eight subjects each were used. Work rates
were divided into three categories as follows: high
activity level (0.15 horsepower [hp] per person),
medium activity level (0.1 hp per person), and low
activity level (0.05 hp per person). Evidence of
physical stress (i.e., increased body temperature, blood
pressure, etc.) was recorded, and individuals were
eliminated from further testing if certain stress criteria
were met. The amount of water consumed by the test
subjects during the work cycles was also recorded.
Water was provided to the individuals on request.
Table 3-86 presents the water intake rates obtained
at the three different activity levels and the various
environmental temperatures. The data presented are
for test subjects with continuous data only (i.e., those
test subjects who were not eliminated at any stage of
the study due to stress conditions). Water intake was
the highest at all activity levels when environmental
temperatures were increased. The highest intake rate

February 2019

was observed at the low activity level at 100°F
(0.65 L/hour); however, there were no data for higher
activity levels at 100°F. It should be noted that this
study estimated intake on an hourly basis during
various levels of physical activity. These hourly intake
rates cannot be converted to daily intake rates by
multiplying by 24 hours/day because they are only
representative of intake during the specified activity
levels, and the intake rates for the rest of the day are
not known. Therefore, comparison of intake rate
values from this study cannot be made with values
from the previously described studies on drinking
water intake.
3.6.1.2. U.S.
Army
(1983,
1999)―Water
Consumption Planning Factors
The U.S. Army has developed water consumption
planning factors to enable it to transport an adequate
amount of water to soldiers in the field under various
conditions (U.S. Army, 1983, 1999). Both climate and
activity levels were used to determine the appropriate
water consumption needs. Consumption factors have
been established for the following uses: (1) drinking,
(2) heat treatment, (3) personal hygiene,
(4) centralized hygiene, (5) food preparation and
sanitation, (6) laundry, (7) medical treatment,
(8) vehicle and aircraft maintenance, (9) graves
registration, and (10) construction. Only personal
drinking water consumption factors are described
here. Drinking water consumption planning factors are
based on the estimated amount of water needed to
replace fluids lost by urination, perspiration, and
respiration. It assumes that water lost to urinary output
averages 1 quart/day (0.9 L/day), and perspiration
losses range from almost nothing in a controlled
environment to 1.5 quarts/day (1.4 L/day) in a very hot
climate where individuals are performing strenuous
work. Water losses to respiration are typically very
low except in extreme cold where water losses can
range from 1 to 3 quarts/day (0.9 to 2.8 L/day). This
occurs when the humidity of inhaled air is near zero,
but expired air is 98% saturated at body temperature
(U.S. Army, 1983).
Drinking water is defined by the U.S. Army (1983,
1999) as “all fluids consumed by individuals to satisfy
body needs for internal water.” This includes soups,
hot and cold drinks, and tap water. Planning factors
have been established for hot, temperate, and cold
climates based on the following mixture of activities
among the workforce: 15% of the force performing
light work, 65% of the force performing medium
work, and 20% of the force performing heavy work.
Hot climates are defined as tropical and arid areas
where the temperature is greater than 80°F. Temperate

Page 3-27



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
climates are defined as areas where the mean daily
temperature ranges from 32 to 80°F. Cold regions are
areas where the mean daily temperature is less than
32°F. Table 3-87 presents drinking water consumption
factors for these three climates. These factors are
based on research on individuals and small unit
training exercises. The estimates are assumed to be
conservative because they are rounded up to account
for the subjective nature of the activity mix and minor
water losses that are not considered (U.S. Army, 1983,
1999).
The advantage of using these data is that they
provide conservative estimates of drinking water
intake among individuals performing at various levels
of physical activity in hot, temperate, and cold
climates. However, the planning factors described
here are based on assumptions about water loss from
urination, perspiration, and respiration, and are not
based on survey data or actual measurements.
3.6.1.3. Sohn et al. (2001)―Fluid Consumption
Related to Climate among Children in the
United States
Sohn et al. (2001) investigated the relationship
between fluid consumption among children aged 1 to
10 years and local climate using data from the
NHANES III (1988−1994). Children who completed
the 24-hour dietary interview (or proxy interview for
the younger children) during the NHANES III survey
were selected for the analysis. Breast-fed children
were excluded from the analysis. Among 8,613
children who were surveyed, 688 (18%) were
excluded due to incomplete data. A total of
7,925 eligible children remained. Because data for
climatic conditions were not collected in the NHANES
III survey, the mean daily maximum temperature from
1961 to 1990, averaged for the month during which the
NHANES III survey was conducted, was obtained for
each survey location from the U.S. Local Climate
Historical Database. Of the 7,925 eligible children
with complete dietary data, temperature information
was derived for only 3,869 children (48.8%) because
detailed information on survey location, in terms of
county and state, was released only for counties with a
population of more than a half million.
Sohn et al. (2001) calculated the total amount of
fluid intake for each child by adding the fluid intake
from plain drinking water and the fluid intake from
foods and beverages other than plain drinking water
provided by NHANES III. Sohn et al. (2001)
identified major fluid sources as milk (and milk
drinks), juice (fruit and vegetable juices and other
noncarbonated drinks), carbonated drinks, and plain
water. Fluid intake from sources other than these

February 2019

major sources was grouped into other foods and
beverages. Other foods and beverages included bottled
water, coffee, tea, baby food, soup, water-based
beverages, and water used for diluting food.
Table 3-88 presents mean fluid ingestion rates of
selected fluids for the total sample population and for
the subsets of the sample population with and without
temperature information. The estimated mean total
fluid and plain water ingestion rates for the
3,869 children for whom temperature information was
obtained are presented in Table 3-89 according to age
(years), sex, race/ethnicity, poverty:income ratio,
region, and urbanicity. Poverty:income ratio was
defined as the ratio of the reported family income to
the federal poverty level. The following categories
were
assigned:
low
socioeconomic
status
(SES) = 0.000 to 1.300 times the poverty:income
ratio; medium SES = 1.301 to 3.500 times the
poverty/income level; and high SES = 3.501 or greater
times the poverty/income level. Regions were
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West, as defined by
the U.S. Census Bureau (see Table 3-89). Sohn et al.
(2001) did not find a significant association between
mean daily maximum temperature and total fluid or
plain water ingestion, either before or after controlling
for sex, age, SES, and race or ethnicity. However,
significant associations between fluid ingestion and
age, sex, socioeconomic status, and race and ethnicity
were reported.
The main strength of the Sohn et al. (2001) study
is the evaluation of water intake as it relates to weather
data. The main limitations of this study were that
northeastern
and
western
regions
were
over-represented because temperature data were only
available for counties with populations over one-half
million. In addition, whites were under-represented
compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Other
limitations include lack of data for children from
extremely cold or hot weather conditions.

Page 3-28



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
levels. Intake was for plain water (i.e., including tap
water, water from a cooler or drinking fountain, spring
water, and noncarbonated bottled water), water in
beverages and food, and total water (i.e., the sum of
plain water and moisture in beverages and food).
Beverages included “all types of liquid milk, shakes,
fruit or vegetable juices, juice drinks, carbonated and
noncarbonated sweetened or unsweetened drinks,
coffee, tea, hot chocolate, all alcoholic drinks, and
carbonated water.” Multiple linear regression was
used to compute adjusted mean water intake based on
covariates such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass
index, income, education, smoking status, chronic
illness, survey wave, survey day, and leisure-time
physical activity. Leisure-time physical activity was
categorized as having any leisure-time activity lasting
≥10 minutes over the previous month, and according
to the average activity level on a given day (i.e., mostly
sitting, mostly standing, carry light loads or climb
hills, or heavy work or carry heavy loads). Table 3-90
provides a summary of water intake for adults
according to these activity categories. Higher intake
rates of plain and total water were associated with
participation in any leisure-time activity. Higher
intake of moisture from beverages and total water
were associated with higher average activity levels on
a usual day (see Table 3-90).
Kant and Graubard (2010) used a similar approach
with data from NHANES 2005−2006 to estimate
water intake for children ages 2−19 years of age
(N = 3,978). However, the activity level definitions
differed from those used for adults in Kant and
Graubard (2009). Kant and Graubard (2010) classified
activity levels for 2- to 11-year-old children based on
the number of times per week the child was reported
to have played or exercised hard enough to induce
sweat. The categories were: 0 times = none, 1−2 = a
little, 3−4 = some, and ≥5 = a lot. For children
12−19 years of age, activity levels were based on three
questions about whether participants had any
leisure-time activity lasting ≥10 minutes. The three
questions pertained to vigorous, moderate, or muscle
strengthening activities. The categories were no to all
three questions = none, yes to 1 question = a little, yes
to 2 questions = some, and yes to all three
questions = a lot. Table 3-90 provides water intake
estimates based on these activity levels. Kant and
Graubard noted that the physical activity level was
only weakly associated with plain water intake, but not
with the moisture content of beverages or foods, or
with total water.
These studies provide information on water intake
based on physical activity. However, the water
categories are somewhat different from those used
elsewhere in this chapter. For example, plain water

February 2019

category appears to include both tap water and bottled
water. Likewise, beverage moisture may include both
water that is intrinsic to purchased drinks (i.e., widely
distributed beverages such as carbonated soft drinks)
as well as beverages that may be prepared with
community tap water (e.g., coffee).
3.6.1.5. Yang and Chun (2014)―Consumptions of
Plain Water, Moisture in Foods and
Beverages, and Total Water in Relation to
Dietary Micronutrient Intakes and Serum
Nutrient Profiles among U.S. Adults
Yang and Chun (2014) conducted a study similar
to Kant et al. (2009). They estimated water intake
among adults, ages 20 years of age and older, based on
activity levels. NHANES 2005−2006 data were used
to estimate intake of plain water, water from beverages
and food, and total water. The definitions of these
water categories were the same as those in Kant et al.
(2009), but the levels of physical activity were defined
differently. Yang and Chun (2014) based the activity
levels on “the metabolic equivalent (MET) score
calculated by combining the intensity level of the
leisure-time activities reported, mean duration and
frequency.” Water intake was evaluated for four
activity levels: no activity (0) and three tertiles of the
MET score (T1, T2, and T3). The mean daily total
water intake for adults was 3,066 g (see Table 3-90).
Yang and Chun (2014) reported that the contributions
to total water were 46% from beverages, 32% from
plain water, and 22% from food, and higher activity
was associated with higher total water intake.
Like the Kant et al. (2009) study, this study
provides information on total water intake based on
activity levels. However, the water categories differ
from those used elsewhere in this chapter.
3.6.1.6. Montain
and
Ely
(2010)―Water
Requirements and Soldier Hydration
Montain and Ely (2010) provided an overview of
factors that affect soldiers’ hydration and water
balance, including environment, physical activity and
load, and body size and gender. For example,
increasing temperature and relative humidity increase
sweating and the need for water replacement. The type
of clothing worn and the load being carried can also
affect the rate of perspiration and need for water
replacement. Factors affecting water needs in cold
climates include: cold-induced diuresis (increased
urine loss), respiratory water loss from breathing cold
dry air, clothing insulation that induces sweating, and
the metabolic cost of movement in cold terrain. High
altitude hypoxia can also contribute to water loss.
Because sweat losses are dependent on exercise

Page 3-29



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
intensity and duration, water needs increase as energy
expenditure increases (Montain and Ely, 2010).
Energy expenditure and the need for water
replacement also increases with carrying increasingly
heavy loads. Montain and Ely (2010) suggested that
activity-related caloric costs increase with increasing
body size; thus, larger individuals may require larger
amounts of water. Likewise, men may require more
water than women because they “are heavier and
sweat more profusely than women.” Montain and Ely
(2010) stated that “an individual soldier’s daily water
requirements to sustain hydration can range from
2 L/day to an excess of 12 L/day, depending on
weather conditions, physical activity, and physical
size.
This report provides useful information on the
factors influencing water losses during military
operations. The values presented here are consistent
with the recommended planning factors summarized
in U.S. Army (1983, 1999) and Section 3.6.1.2.
3.7.

WATER INGESTION WHILE
SWIMMING AND DIVING
3.7.1. Key Studies on Water Ingestion While
Swimming
The section that follows provides a summary of the
key study on water ingestion that may occur while
swimming.
3.7.1.1. Dufour et al. (2006)―Water Ingestion
during Swimming Activities in a Pool: A
Pilot Study; Dufour et al. (2017)―Ingestion
of Swimming Pool Water by Recreational
Swimmers
Dufour et al. (2006) estimated the amount of water
ingested while swimming, using cyanuric acid as an
indicator of pool water ingestion exposure. Cyanuric
acid is a breakdown product of chloroisocyanates,
which are commonly used as disinfectant stabilizers in
recreational water treatment. Because ingested
cyanuric acid passes through the body unmetabolized
(Allen et al., 1982), the volume of water ingested can
be estimated based on the amount of cyanuric acid
measured in the pool water and in the urine of
swimmers, as follows:
Vpool water ingested = Vurine × (CAurine ÷ CApool)
(Eqn. 3-1)
where:
Vpool water ingested =

volume of pool water ingested
(mL),

February 2019

Vurine

=

CAurine

=

CApool

=

volume of urine collected over a
24-hour period (mL),
concentration of cyanuric acid in
urine (mg/L), and
concentration of cyanuric acid in
pool water (mg/L).

The assumption that ingested cyanuric acid passes
through the body unmetabolized is based on a study by
Allen et al. (1982) in which two volunteers ingested
known amounts of cyanuric acid and collected their
own urine for 24 hours thereafter. Allen et al. (1982)
estimated the recovery of ingested cyanuric acid to be
98%. Also, according to Dufour et al. (2006), dermal
absorption of cyanuric acid has been shown to be
negligible. Thus, the concentration in urine was
assumed to represent the amount ingested. Dufour et
al. (2006) estimated pool water intake among
53 swimmers that participated in a pilot study at an
outdoor swimming pool treated with chloroisocyanate.
This pilot study population included 12 adults (4 males
and 8 females) and 41 children under 18 years of age
(20 males and 21 females). The study participants
were asked not to swim for 24 hours before or after a
45-minute period of active swimming in the pool. Pool
water samples were collected prior to the start of
swimming activities, and swimmers’ urine was
collected for 24 hours after the swimming event ended.
The pool water and urine sample were analyzed for
cyanuric acid.
Table 3-91 presents the results of this pilot study.
The mean volumes of water ingested over a 45-minute
period were 16 mL (16/mL/0.75 hr = 21 mL/hr) for
adults and 37 mL (37 mL/0.75 hr = 49 mL/hr) for
children. The maximum volume of water ingested by
adults was 53 mL/0.75 hr (71 mL/hr) and by children,
was 154 mL/0.75 hr (205 mL/hr). The 97th percentile
volume of water ingested by children was
approximately 90 mL/0.75 hr (120 mL/hr).
This study is one of the first attempts to measure
water ingested while swimming. However, the number
of study participants was low, and data cannot be
broken out by the recommended age categories (U.S.
EPA, 2005).
Using the same approach as in the pilot study
reported in Dufour et al. (2006), Dufour et al. (2017)
investigated the ingestion of swimming pool water
among a study population of 549 individuals at nine
public swimming pools in the Columbus, Ohio area
that had been disinfected with chloroisocyanurate. The
study participants included both males and females in
approximately equal numbers. The participants
represented three age groups: children 6−10 years old
(N = 66), teens 11−15 years old (N = 121), and adults,

Page 3-30



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
defined as individuals 16 years and older (N = 362).
Study participants were asked to perform normal
swimming activities for approximately one hour and
collect their own urine over the following 24 hours.
For all swimmers, the arithmetic mean pool water
volume ingested was 32 mL/event and the geometric
mean was 14 mL/event (Dufour et al., 2017).
Table 3-92 provides the ingestion rates in units of
mL/hour by age and sex, as reported by Dufour et al.
(2017). Children 6−10 years old ingested more water
per swimming event and spent nearly twice as much
time in the water as older children and adults. The
estimated geometric mean ingestion rate for children
6−10 years, and teens 11−15 years was 24 mL/hour.
The estimated geometric mean ingestion rate for adults
(ages 16 years and older) was 12 mL/hour, but adult
males ingested water at a higher rate (16 mL/hour)
than adult females (9 mL/hour). The 95th percentile
ingestion rates were 96 mL/hour for children,
152 mL/hour for teens, and 105 mL/hour for adults
(Dufour and Wymer, 2017).
Using data obtained from the authors (Dufour,
2017), arithmetic mean ingestion rates and additional
percentiles of the distributions were estimated for
additional age groups of children as shown in
Table 3-93. The arithmetic mean ingestion rates were
38, 44, 33, and 28 mL/hour for ages 6 to <11, 11 to
<16, 16 to <21, and 21+ years, respectively. The 95th
percentile ingestion rates were 96, 152, 105, and
92 mL/hour for ages 6 to <11, 11 to <16, 16 to <21,
and 21+ years, respectively.
This study provides estimated swimming pool
water ingestion rates based on a large sample
population, and the volumes of water ingested per
event are relatively consistent with those of the pilot
study. According to Dufour et al. (2017) “Caution
must be taken in interpreting these derived numbers
[i.e., ingestion rates] too strictly, given they are based
on self-reported data (minutes in the water); thus, they
could be less reliable because of the anecdotal
propensity of children, and even adults, to under- or
over-estimate how much time is spent in the water.”
As noted by Dufour et al. (2006), swimming behavior
of pool swimmers may be similar to freshwater
swimmers, but may differ from saltwater swimmers.
Relevant Studies on Water Ingestion
While Swimming, Diving, or Engaging in
Recreational Water Activities
The sections that follows provide summaries of the
relevant studies on water ingestion while engaging in
recreational water activities.

3.7.2.

February 2019

3.7.2.1. Schijven and de Roda Husman (2006)―A
Survey of Diving Behavior and Accidental
Occupational and Sport Divers to Assess the
Risk of Infection with Waterborne
Pathogenic Microorganisms
Schijven and de Roda Husman (2006) estimated
the amount of water ingested by occupational and
sports divers in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were
used to obtain information on the number of dives for
various types of water bodies, and the approximate
volume of water ingested per dive. Estimates of the
amount of water ingested were made by comparing
intake to common volumes (i.e., a few
drops = 2.75 mL; shot glass = 25 mL; coffee
cup = 100 mL; soda glass = 190 mL). The study was
conducted among occupational divers in 2002 and
among sports divers in 2003 and included responses
from more than 500 divers. Table 3-94 provides the
results of this study. On average, occupational divers
ingested 9.8 mL/dive in marine water and 5.7 mL/dive
in fresh water. Sports divers wearing an ordinary
diving mask ingested 9.0 mL/dive marine water and
13 mL/dive fresh recreational water. Sports divers
who wore full face masks ingested less water. The
main limitation of this study is that no measurements
were taken. It relies on estimates of the perceived
amount of water ingested by the divers. Although
these data are from the Netherlands, it is assumed that
water ingestion among divers in the United States
would be similar, and studies involving U.S. divers
were not identified.
3.7.2.2. Schets et al. (2011)―Exposure Assessment
for Swimmers in Bathing Waters and
Swimming Pools
Schets et al. (2011) collected exposure data for
swimmers in fresh water, seawater, and swimming
pools in 2007 and 2009. Information on the frequency,
duration, and amount of water swallowed were
collected via questionnaires administered to nearly
10,000 people in the Netherlands. Individuals 15 years
of age and older were considered adults and answered
questions for themselves, and a parent answered the
questions for their eldest child under 15 years of age.
Survey participants estimated the amount of water that
they swallowed while swimming by responding in one
of four ways: (1) none or only a few drops; (2) one or
two mouthfuls; (3) three to five mouthfuls; or (4) six
to eight mouthfuls. Schets et al. (2011) conducted a
series of experiments to measure the amount of water
that corresponded to a mouthful of water and
converted the data in the four response categories to
volumes of water ingested. Monte Carlo analyses were
used to combine the distribution of volume

Page 3-31



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
(i.e., mouthful) measurements with the distribution of
responses in the four response categories to generate
distributions of the amount of water swallowed per
event for adult men and women, and children less than
15 year of age. Table 3-95 presents the means and 95%
confidence intervals for the duration of swimming and
amount of water ingested during swimming.
Frequency data were also provided by Schets et al.
(2011), but these data are not presented here because
they are for the population of the Netherlands and may
not be representative of swimming frequency in the
United States. According to Schets et al. (2011), the
mean volume of water ingested by children
(<15 years) during an average swimming pool event
lasting 81 minutes was 51 mL or 0.63 mL/min
(38 mL/hour). The values for children were slightly
lower for swimming in fresh water and seawater. For
adults, the mean volume of water ingested ranged from
18 to 34 mL over swimming events lasting 41 to 68
minutes (see Table 3-95).
The advantages of this study are that it is based on
a relatively large sample size and that data are
provided for various types of swimming environments
(i.e., pools, fresh water, and seawater). Although these
data are from the Netherlands, and based primarily on
self-reported estimates, the mean values reported in
this study are similar to those based on measurements
of cyanuric acid in the urine of U.S. swimmers as
reported by Dufour et al. (2006).
3.7.2.3. Dorevitch et al. (2011)―Water Ingestion
during Water Recreation
Dorevitch et al. (2011) estimated the volumes of
water ingested during “limited contact water
recreation activities.” These activities included
canoeing, fishing, kayaking, motor boating, rowing,
wading and splashing, and walking. Full contact
scenarios (i.e., swimming and immersion) were also
evaluated. Dorevitch et al. (2011) estimated water
intake among individuals greater than 6 years of age
using two different methods in studies conducted in
2009. In the first surface water study, self-reported
estimates of ingestion were obtained via interview of
2,705 individuals after they had engaged in recreation
activities in Chicago area surface waters. A total of
2,705 participants reported whether they swallowed no
water, a drop or two, a teaspoon, or one or more
mouthfuls of water during one of the five limited
contact recreational activities (i.e., canoeing, fishing,
kayaking, motor boating, and rowing). A second study
was conducted in swimming pools where
662 participants engaged in limited contact scenarios
(i.e., canoeing, simulated fishing, kayaking, motor
boating, rowing, wading/splashing, and walking), as

February 2019

well as full contact activities such as swimming and
immersion. Participants were interviewed after
performing their water activity and reported on their
estimated water ingestion. In addition, 24-hour urine
samples were collected for analysis of cyanuric acid, a
tracer of swimming pool water. Translation factors for
each of the reported categories of ingestion (e.g., none,
drop/teaspoon, mouthful) were developed using the
results of the urine analyses. These translation factors
were used to estimate the volume of water ingested for
the various water activities evaluated in this study
(Dorevitch et al., 2011). Table 3-96 presents the
estimated volumes of water ingested for the limited
and full contact scenarios. Swimmers had the highest
estimated water intake (mean = 10 mL/hr; 95% upper
confidence limit = 35 mL/hr) among the activities
evaluated.
The advantage of this study is that it provides
information on the estimated volume of water ingested
during both limited and full contact recreational
activities. However, the data are based on
self-reporting, and data are not provided for individual
age groups of the population.
3.7.2.4. Suppes et al. (2014)―Assessment of
Swimmers Behaviors on Pool Water
Ingestion
Suppes et al. (2014) conducted a study at four
swimming pools in Tucson, AZ in 2012. Pool water
ingestion was estimated based on the concentration of
cyanuric acid in the urine as in the Dufour et al. (2006,
2017) studies. Environmental sensors and
videography techniques were also used to identify
activities that might lead to increased water ingestion
(e.g., head submersion, splashes of water to the face,
duration of swimming activities). Questionnaires were
used to collect information on age, gender, and type of
swimming activity that participants engaged in
(e.g., playing, diving, sitting, lap swimming). A total
of 64 swimmers, ages 5 to 52 years old, participated in
the study, and 35 of those who were videotaped also
submitted useable 24-hour urine samples after
swimming for a 45-minute period. The mean pool
water ingestion rates for these 35 swimmers was
reported to be 13.7 mL/hr (see Table 3-97). The
age-group-specific ingestion rates were 3.5 mL/hr for
adults (>18 years of age, N = 19) and 25.7 mL/hr for
children (≤18 years of age, N = 16). The mean
ingestion rate for children in this study was similar to
the geometric mean ingestion rate for children (6 to
15 years of age) observed by Dufour et al. (2017).
Leisure swimmers were more likely to ingest pool
water than lap swimmers, and splashes of the water to
the face, were associated with higher ingestion rates.

Page 3-32



Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3—Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
Associations between the number and duration of head
submersions, as estimated by videography, and pool
water ingestion rates were not observed. The
environmental sensors were found to be less accurate
for assessing the number and duration of head
submersions when compared to use of videography.
This study provides additional evidence of pool water
ingestion among swimmers, but is based on a
relatively small sample; the data for children were not
provided according to age categories, and upper
percentile (e.g., 90th or 95th percentile) values were not
provided.
3.7.2.5. Sinclair et al. (2016a)―Variability in
24-Hour Excretion of Cyanuric Acid:
Implications
for
Water
Exposure
Assessment
Sinclair et al. (2016a) tested the assumption that
the cyanuric acid ingested while swimming is
completed excreted within 24 hours. In the Sinclair et
al. (2016a) study, 26 volunteers (20−56 years of age;
mostly male) drank a solution containing 1 mg of
cyanuric acid and collected their own urine for
24 hours thereafter. The urine samples were then
analyzed for cyanuric acid to estimate the amount that
was excreted over the 24 hours post ingestion. The
recovery of cyanuric acid over 24 hours varied among
the 26 participants. The mean value was 85.3%, and
the median was 94.5%, with 16 of the 26 individuals
having excretion values ranging from 89 to 105%.
This study provides information on the excretion
of cyanuric acid. The information is relevant to studies
that use cyanuric acid levels in urine to estimate
swimming pool water ingestion. The study was
conducted in Australia, but excretion of cyanuric acid
among that population would not be expected to differ
from U.S. populations.
3.7.2.6. DeFlorio-Barker et al. (2017)―Child
Environmental Exposures to Water and
Sand at the Beach: Findings from Studies
of Over 68,000 Subjects at 12 Beaches
DeFlorio-Barker et al. (2017) estimated the
amount of water ingested per beach water contact
event by conducting simulations based on
self-reported time spent in the water and the amount of
water swallowed per minute. Data for the time spent
in the water were based on data from interviews
conducted in 2003−2009 at temperate beaches in the
contiguous United States. (DeFlorio-Barker et al.,
2017; Arnold et al., 2016). The survey data
represented a total of 68,685 beachgoers; 21,015 at
4 freshwater beaches and 47,670 at 8 marine beaches.
At both freshwater and marine beaches, approximately

February 2019

67% of beachgoers had some form of contact with the
water (e.g., wading, swimming, playing); 13,568 had
water contact at freshwater beaches and 31,685 had
water contact at marine beaches. Data on the amount
of water swallowed per minute were based on
swimming pool studies conducted by Dufour et al.
(2017) using cyanuric acid as a biomarker of exposure,
as described in Section 3.7.1.1.
Table 3-98 presents age-specific estimates of the
amount of water swallowed per water contact event for
freshwater, marine, and all types of beach locations
combined based on these simulations. Children were
found to ingest more water per event than adults, males
were found to ingest more than females, and ingestion
by individuals recreating at marine beaches tended to
be higher than for those at freshwater beaches.
The advantage of this study is that it provides
estimates of the volume of water ingested while
recreating at freshwater and marine beaches. The
estimates are based on the time spent in the water, and
represent the amount swallowed per event in units of
mL/event. These data may not be applicable to other
types of water contact activities (e.g., water skiing or
diving, swimming in a pool) where the time spent in
the water may differ from that of beachgoers. Also,
any uncertainties associated with recall data on the
time spent in the water would also be applicable to
these estimates.

INGESTION
3.8.1. Sinclair et al. (2016b)―Measuring Water
Ingestion from Spray Exposures
Sinclair et al. (2016b) estimated the volume of
water ingested from spray exposures. Twenty-six
study participants, aged 18 to 25 years, engaged in a
10-minute simulated car wash activity using a
high-pressure spray device and water treated with
cyanuric acid. Study participants were asked not to
swim in a cyanuric acid-treated swimming pool for
48 hours prior to the simulation and provided
presimulation urine samples for a subset of the
participants to verify the absence of cyanuric acid in
the urine. All participants wore protective coveralls,
gloves, waterproof footwear, and safety glasses during
the simulation. After the simulations, 24-hour urine
samples were collected and analyzed for cyanuric
acid. Among the 26 participants, 18 had quantifiable
levels of cyanuric acid in their urine after engaging in
the simulation exercise; 6 had trace levels, and 2 had
no detectable levels. As in the Dufour et al. (2006,
2017) studies, it was assumed that 100% of the
cyanuric acid that was ingested was excreted in the
urine (see Section 3.7.1.1). The maximum volume of
3.8.

Update for Chapter 3 of the Exposure Factors Handbook
Chapter 3―Ingestion of Water and Other Select Liquids
water ingested was estimated to be 3.79 mL, and the
10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles were 0.019, 0.175, and
1.84 mL, respectively. When the data were adjusted
for potential variability in excretion among
individuals, based on data from Sinclair et al. (2016a;
see Section 3.7.2.5), the mean and 95th percentile
volumes of water ingested were estimated to be 0.438
(SD 1.24) and 1.93 mL, respectively.
This study is based on a relatively small sample,
but provides data for a scenario in which water may be
inadvertently ingested. As noted by Sinclair et al.
(2016b), while it is assumed that this exposure
scenario represents ingestion alone, inhalation may
have accounted for a portion of the exposures that
occurred during the simulation. Thus, the ingestion
estimates provided in Sinclair et al. (2016b) would be
conservative estimates of ingestion exposures.

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
Includes all participants whether or not they ingested any water from the source during survey period.
Direct water is defined as water ingested directly as a beverage; indirect water is defined as water added in the preparation of food or beverages. Does not include
indirect consumption of bottled water.
Represents the percentage of individuals consuming at least once over the 2-day survey period.
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III
and CSFII Reports: HNIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group Recommendations (NCHS, 1993).

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
Includes all participants whether or not they ingested any water from the source during survey period.
Direct water is defined as water ingested directly as a beverage; indirect water, defined as water added in the preparation of food or beverages, was not accounted
for in the estimation of bottled water intake.
Represents the percentage of individuals consuming at least once over the 2-day survey period.
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III
and CSFII Reports: HNIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group Recommendations (NCHS, 1993).

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
Excludes individuals who did not ingest water from the source during the survey period.
Direct water is defined as water ingested directly as a beverage; indirect water is defined as water added in the preparation of food or beverages.
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III
and CSFII Reports: HNIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group Recommendations (NCHS, 1993).

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
Excludes individuals who did not ingest water from the source during the survey period.
Direct water is defined as water ingested directly as a beverage; indirect water is defined as water added in the preparation of food or beverages. Does not include
indirect consumption of bottled water.
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III
and CSFII Reports: HNIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group Recommendations (NCHS, 1993).

These values (mL/day) were used in the following equations to estimate the quantiles and averages for total tap water
intake shown in Table 3-61.
97.5 percentile intake rate = exp (µ + [1.96 × σ])
75 percentile intake rate = exp (µ + [0.6745 × σ])
50 percentile intake rate = exp (µ)
25 percentile intake rate = exp (µ − [0.6745 × σ])
2.5 percentile intake rate = exp (µ − [1.96 × σ])
Mean intake rate = exp (µ + [0.5 × σ2])
= Mean.
= Standard deviation.

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
Represents the percentage of individuals consuming at least once over the 2-day survey period.
All water sources: water, community supply (direct and indirect water consumption); water, bottled (direct water consumption only); water, well or rain cistern
(direct and indirect water consumption); water, spring (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don't drink tap water (direct and indirect water consumption);
water, other (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don’t know (direct and indirect water consumption).
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III
and CSFII Reports: HNIS/NCHS Analytical Working Group Recommendations (NCHS, 1993).
Community water: water, community supply (direct and indirect water consumption).
Other sources: water, well or rain cistern (direct and indirect water consumption); water, spring (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don't drink tap
water (direct and indirect water consumption); water, other (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don't know (direct and indirect water consumption).
Bottled water: water, bottled (direct water consumption only).

Based on the average of 2 days of consumption reported for each NHANES respondent. If the respondent reported zero consumption on 1 of the 2 days and
nonzero consumption on the other day, his/her average consumption would be the average of zero and nonzero consumption. Single day rates can be generated
using http://fcid.foodrisk.org/.
All Water Sources: water, community supply (direct and indirect water consumption); water, bottled (direct water consumption only); water, well or rain cistern
(direct and indirect water consumption); water, spring (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don't drink tap water (direct and indirect water consumption);
water, other (direct and indirect water consumption); water, don’t know (direct and indirect water consumption).
Estimates are less statistically reliable based on guidance published in the Joint Policy on Variance Estimation and Statistical Reporting Standards on NHANES III

Samples sizes for estimates in mL/kg-day are smaller than estimates in mL/day because body weight was not reported for some participants. Weighted samples sizes
represent the number in each age group based on the unweighted number in the sample extrapolated to the overall U.S. population.
The sample size does not meet the minimum reporting requirements as described in the Third Report on Nutrition Monitoring in the United States (LSRO, 1995).
