Microbiological Quality of Roof-Harvested Rainwater and Health Risks: A Review
W. Ahmed,* T. Gardner, and S. Toze
Roof-harvested rainwater (RHRW) has been considered an
eﬀective alternative water source for drinking and various
nonpotable uses in a number of countries throughout the world.
The most signiﬁcant issue in relation to using untreated RHRW
for drinking or other potable uses, however, is the potential
public health risks associated with microbial pathogens. This
paper reviews the available research reporting on the microbial
quality of RHRW and provides insight on the capacity of fecal
indicator bacteria to monitor health risks and disease outbreaks
associated with the consumption of untreated RHRW. Several
zoonotic bacterial and protozoan pathogens were detected in
individual and communal rainwater systems. The majority of
the studies reported in the literature assessed the quality of
rainwater on the basis of the presence or absence of speciﬁc
pathogens, with little information available regarding the
actual numbers of such pathogens. In addition, no information
is available concerning the ongoing prevalence of diﬀerent
pathogens in RHRW over time. The published data suggest
that the microbial quality of RHRW should be considered less
than that expected for potable water and that the commonly
used indicators may not be suitable to indicate the presence of
pathogens in RHRW. Several case control studies established
potential links between gastroenteritis and consumption of
untreated RHRW. Therefore, health risks assessment models,
such as those using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment,
should be used to manage and mitigate health risks associated
with drinking and nonpotable uses of RHRW.

he demands on potable water supply are escalating in
line with increasing population growth, particularly in urban
areas, along with increases in industrial output and commerce.
This is further exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate
change on water supply sources. Consequently, water authorities
around the world are keen to explore alternative water sources
(AWSs) to meet ever-increasing demands for potable (i.e., drinking) water. Among the more common AWSs investigated, roofharvested rainwater (RHRW) has been considered to be one of
the most cost eﬀective sources for both drinking and various nonpotable uses, such as irrigation, toilet ﬂushing, car washing, showering, and clothes laundering. Countries that have investigated
the potential beneﬁts of RHRW for these uses include Australia,
Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand,
Thailand, and the United States (Despins et al., 2009; Evans et al.,
2006; Uba and Aghogho, 2000). For example, 10% of Australian
people currently use RHRW as a major source of their drinking
water, and an approximate additional 5% use RHRW as potable
replacement for showering, toilet ﬂushing, and clothes laundering
(ABS 2007).
Many countries have provided subsidies to encourage the
installation of RHRW systems so that such systems will provide water for drinking and nonpotable uses as a mechanism to
promote the increased uptake of AWSs with the speciﬁc aim to
decrease the reliance and use of scheme water (Ahmed et al., 2010;
Albrechtsen, 2002). For instance, in 2006, the Queensland State
Government, Australia, initiated the “Home Water Wise Rebate
Scheme,” which provided subsidies to Southeast Queensland residents who used rainwater for nonpotable domestics uses. More
than 260,000 householders were granted subsidies by December
2008 when the scheme was concluded.
There are several advantages to using RHRW, including (i)
reducing the pressure on the mains water supply, (ii) reducing
stormwater runoﬀ that can often degrade creek ecosystem health,
and (iii) providing an alternative water supply during times of
water restrictions. Despite these advantages, RHRW has not been
widely utilized for drinking due to a lack of information on the
presence and risk from chemical and microbiological pollutants.
Another shortcoming is the lack of appropriate guidelines specifying the use of RHRW for both drinking and nonpotable uses and
how the risk from chemical and microbiological pollutants can
be managed. The most signiﬁcant issue in relation to untreated

RHRW for drinking is the potential public health risks associated with microbial pathogens (Ahmed et al., 2008; Crabtree
et al., 1996; Simmons et al., 2001). A wide array of pathogens
could be present in the feces of birds, insects, mammals, and
reptiles that have access to the roof. Consequently, following
rain events, animal droppings and other organic debris deposited on the roof and gutter can be transported into the tank via
roof runoﬀ. In this scenario, if the untreated water collected
from the roof is used for drinking, there is a potential for disease in people consuming this water. Only limited information
is available, however, regarding the actual health risks associated with the uses of RHRW. It can be postulated that the
magnitude of health risks from nonpotable uses could be lower
than drinking due to lower exposure levels to pathogens. There
is also a general community perception that rainwater is safe
to drink without having to undergo prior treatment. In support of this perception, Dillaha and Zolan (1985) reported that
the quality of RHRW is generally acceptable for drinking and
household use. This was further supported by an epidemiological survey of gastroenteritis among 4- to 6-yr-old children in
rural South Australia who drank rainwater or treated mains
water that suggested RHRW poses no increased risk of gastroenteritis when compared with mains water (Heyworth et al.,
2006). In contrast, a number of other studies on the microbial
quality of RHRW have reported the presence of speciﬁc zoonotic pathogens in individual or communal RHRW systems
(Ahmed et al., 2008; Birks et al., 2004; Crabtree et al., 1996;
Lye, 2002; Simmons et al., 2001; Uba and Aghogho, 2000).
The divergence in outcomes of studies in the quality of RHRW
may be due to high variability from system to system (Lye,
1987, 2002, 2009), and therefore, legitimate questions have
arisen from health regulators regarding the quality of water and
consequent public health risks.
The purpose of this review is (i) to highlight research studies
investigating the microbiological quality of RHRW, (ii) to provide insight on the capacity of fecal indicator bacteria to monitor health risks associated with RHRW, (iii) to highlight disease
outbreaks linked to the consumption of untreated RHRW, and
(iv) to provide insight on how to manage the risk of infection
or gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of RHRW.
It should be noted that poor microbial quality of water poses
a much more acute risk of illness to consumers via exposure to
pathogens compared to chemical pollutants. For this reason,
the chemical quality of RHRW is not covered in this review.

Fecal Indicators and Pathogens
in Roof-Harvested Rainwater
Fecal Indicators
To determine the acceptability of RHRW for drinking, it is
common practice to use drinking water guidelines to monitor
the microbial quality of the water. For most guidelines, this
entails the nondetection of the common indicator bacteria
such as Escherichia coli or thermotolerant coliforms (usually
at numbers <1 colony forming units [CFU]/100 mL) whose
presence are used to indicate potential fecal pollution of the
water (NHMRC–NRMMC, 2004; WHO, 2004). Even when
RHRW is not used for drinking, the assessment of the micro14

bial quality of RHRW is usually undertaken by monitoring the
presence of fecal indicators such as total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens (Ahmed
et al., 2008, 2010; Appan, 1997; CRC for Water Quality and
Treatment, 2006; Dillaha and Zolan, 1985). The World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends that for drinking water, the
total coliforms numbers should be <10 CFU/100 mL in 95%
of samples collected from a particular water source (WHO,
2004). These guidelines also indicate that if the numbers of
total coliforms are >20 CFU/100 mL water, further treatment
should be undertaken prior to drinking. It should be noted
that total coliforms may not be a suitable indicator of fecal contamination in RHRW. Total coliforms in water can comprise
microorganisms that could be fecal in origin but also could be
from other sources such as soil and vegetation, and, therefore,
their presence in open systems such as rainwater tanks that can
easily be contaminated with dust and plant material may not
necessarily indicate fecal contamination. Fecal coliforms and
enterococci are considered much better indicators of fecal contamination, and most guidelines stipulate that fecal coliforms,
E. coli, and enterococci numbers should be zero CFU/100 mL
for drinking water. Such stringent guideline values have been
established for these indicators as these are commonly found
in high numbers in human and animal feces. Their presence
in drinking water, therefore, indicates a strong likelihood that
fecal contamination has occurred and that the water is therefore not suitable for drinking (Baudisöva, 1997).
Most research studies on RHRW reported to date used fecal
indicator bacteria to assess the microbiological quality of the
water. Table 1 shows the percentage of positive samples for
total bacteria and fecal indicator bacteria in water samples from
RHRW reported in 18 research studies. In Micronesia, 155
and 176 RHRW samples were surveyed for total coliforms and
fecal coliforms, respectively. Of these, 57 and 30% samples had
no measurable numbers of total coliforms and fecal coliforms,
respectively (Dillaha and Zolan, 1985). Thirty-nine percent of
samples had total coliform numbers <10 CFU/100 mL, thus
complying with the WHO drinking water guidelines. Despite
the high numbers (61%) of samples not complying with the
guidelines, the authors suggested that the RHRW could be
reasonable for drinking. Lye (1987) also reported that RHRW
could have consistently good quality in a study of the occurrence of fecal coliforms in RHRW samples in Kentucky, USA,
where only one sample out of 30 had fecal coliforms numbers
>10 CFU/100 mL.
In contrast, several studies reported higher numbers of
fecal indicators in RHRW, which, therefore, did not comply
with acceptable drinking water guideline values (Table 1). In
Victoria, Australia, for example, 49 rainwater tanks surveyed
for the presence of total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci
(Spinks et al., 2006) found that 33% were positive for E. coli
and 73% positive for enterococci exceeding the Australian
Drinking Water Guidelines of zero CFU/100 mL (ADWG,
2004). Another recent study in South Korea reported that 92
and 72% of RHRW samples were positive for total coliforms
and E. coli, respectively (Lee et al., 2010). In all the positive
samples, the numbers of these indicators were above the WHO
drinking water guideline values. High numbers of E. coli were
also found in Danish RHRW systems by Albrechtsen (2002),
Journal of Environmental Quality • Volume 40 • January–February 2011



where E. coli was observed to be present in 11 out of 14 systems with numbers ranging from 4 to 900 CFU/100 mL.
The conclusion made in this study was that the presence of E.
coli indicated that the water may not be suitable for drinking
(Albrechtsen, 2002). High numbers of E. coli (ranging from 4
to 800 CFU/100 mL) and enterococci (5 to 200 CFU/100 mL)
were also reported in RHRW samples tested in Queensland,
Australia (Ahmed et al., 2008). In this study, of the 27 samples
tested, 63, 78, and 48% were positive for E. coli, enterococci,
and C. perfringens, respectively. Ahmed et al. (2008) concluded
that as E. coli could not be detected in a number of the water
samples that were positive for other indicators of potential fecal
origin such as enterococci or C. perfringens, RHRW should be
tested for multiple indicators where possible to obtain multiple
lines of evidence on the occurrence of potential fecal contamination. On the basis of these results, they concluded that E. coli
may be of limited use to assess the microbial quality of RHRW.
Several studies also reported that enterococci are more
prevalent in RHRW tanks compared with E. coli (Ahmed et
al., 2008, 2010; CRC for Water Quality and Treatment, 2006;
Spinks et al., 2006) and thus may be a better indicator for
assessing fecal contamination. The greater prevalence of enterococci in RHRW may be due to the fact that enterococci persist
in the water longer than E. coli (McFeters et al., 1974). It has
also been reported that enterococci perform better in terms of
indicating fecal contamination in environmental waters compared with E. coli (Kinzelman et al., 2003). Nonetheless, more
studies on the potential sources and the relative persistence are
needed that compare the usefulness of E. coli versus enterococci in RHRW before any recommendations can be made
concerning which indicators may be the most suitable. Along
with the more traditional microbial indicators, the use of alter-

native indicators in recent years, such as Bacteroides spp. and
Biﬁdobacterium spp., has gained popularity to identify fecal
contamination in environmental waters. To date, however,
these alternative indicators have merely been used for RHRW
quality monitoring. Ahmed et al. (2008) tested Bacteroides
spp. as an alternative indicator to detect fecal contamination
in water samples from RHRW in Southeast Queensland,
Australia, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the 27
RHRW samples tested 2 d after rainfall events, 89% were PCR
positive for Bacteroides spp.. On the basis of these results, it was
concluded that Bacteroides spp. may be a more sensitive indicator for the detection of recent fecal contamination in RHRW
samples due to their short survival time outside of a host, their
exclusivity to the gut of warm-blooded animals, and the fact
that they constitute a relatively larger portion of fecal bacteria
than traditional fecal indicator bacteria (Sghir et al., 2000).

Bacterial Pathogens
To date, only a small number of studies have investigated the
presence of bacterial pathogens in RHRW (Table 2). While
much of the focus on bacterial pathogens in drinking water
is predominantly on enteric indicators and pathogens such
as E. coli and Salmonella spp., in RHRW other nonenteric
pathogens such as Legionella and Aeromonas are also considered to be of concern for human health. The links between
water and Legionella infections is well known, and a recent
study by Khajanchi et al. (2010) demonstrated a link between
Aeromonas spp. isolated from clinical and water samples, indicating a transmission from water.
In one of these studies, Simmons et al. (2001) reported the
presence of Aeromonas spp. and Salmonella spp. in RHRW water
samples collected in Auckland, New Zealand, with, 20 and 0.9%

of the 125 samples tested as positive for Aeromonas spp. and
Salmonella spp., respectively. No results on the pathogen
number were reported in this study, however; therefore, for
a health risk assessment to be undertaken for these microorganisms, an assumption needs to be made that pathogens
such as Salmonella are present but at numbers below the
detection limit of the analysis method used.
Despite this, based on the positive detections obtained,
the authors concluded that RHRW was not suitable for
drinking and recommended further research on the
Aeromonas spp. because of its high prevalence and association with gastroenteritis in both adults and children. Campylobacter spp. has also been detected in tank
water samples in New Zealand using PCR (Savill et al.,
2001). In all, 37% of the samples tested were positive for
Campylobacter spp. with numbers ranging from <0.06 to
0.56 MPN–PCR/100 mL water. In addition to Aeromonas
spp., other microbial pathogens such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Legionella spp., C. jejuni, and Mycobacterium
spp. have also been detected in RHRW in Denmark
(Albrechtsen, 2002). On the basis of these ﬁndings, the
author concluded that connecting RHRW to the drinking
water systems would increase the level of risk of gastroenteritis and respiratory illness.
A recent study that used PCR to detect evidence of bacterial pathogens in tank water in Southeast Queensland,
Australia, found that between 1 and 19% of the samples
were positive for enteric pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila,
C. jejuni, C. coli, and Salmonella spp. (Ahmed et al., 2010).
In addition, 8% of the samples were positive for the respiratory pathogen L. pneumophila. The authors suggested
that RHRW appears to decrease in microbiological quality after rain events, although the source of this reduction
in microbial quality, the impact of duration between rain
events on the quality of RHRW, and the time it may take
after rain events before RHRW improves in quality during
storage remains unknown.

Despite a well-established zoonotic link, as with the presence of bacterial pathogens, the presence of protozoan
pathogens in RHRW has not been extensively investigated,
with only a few studies examining RHRW for the presence of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. (see Table
2). Crabtree et al. (1996) reported that in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts in tank
water can be highly prevalent. They found that in 44 water
samples tested from private and public rainwater systems,
45 and 23% of samples were positive for Giardia cysts
and Cryptosporidium oocysts, respectively. The levels of
cysts and oocysts were found to range from 1 to 10 organisms/100 L, with one sample containing 70 oocysts/100
L, and the numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts in all the
positive samples were well above the acceptable guidelines
of zero tolerance of protozoa pathogens as described for safe
drinking water in the United States. Simmons et al. (2001)
also reported the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in 4% of
tank water samples in Auckland, New Zealand. However,
unlike Crabtree et al. (1996), Simmons et al. (2001) were
Journal of Environmental Quality • Volume 40 • January–February 2011



unable to detect any Giardia cysts. They concluded, however,
that the prevalence of protozoan pathogens may have been
underestimated because the standard analytical technique had
a low detection sensitivity.
Albrechtsen (2002) similarly reported the presence of
Cryptosporidium spp. in Danish RHRW. They tested 17 rainwater samples, of which 6 were positive for Cryptosporidium
spp. The numbers of Cryoptosporidium spp. were as high as 50
oocysts/L; however, as in the study of Simmons et al. (2001),
Giardia spp. was not detected in any of the samples. In contrast, another study in Queensland, Australia, reported the
presence of G. lamblia in 19% of RHRW samples tested, but
none of the samples were positive for C. parvum (Ahmed et al.,
2008, 2010). One possible reason for the diﬀerences between
the Australian study and those from elsewhere in the type of
protozoan pathogen detected may be the diﬀerent wildlife that
has access to roofs. In Queensland, for example, marsupial possums are a common animal in and around urban dwellings and
frequently traverse roof tops in their nocturnal movements.
Possums are known to be carriers of Giardia cysts (Marino
et al., 1992); thus, these possums could be a major source of
Giardia spp. in RHRW in Queensland, while wild birds or
other animals are the source of the Cryptosporidium spp. in the
other studies.

Correlation between Fecal Indicators and Pathogens
in Roof-Harvested Rainwater
As already indicated, RHRW can be contaminated with either
traditional fecal indicator microorganisms or pathogens. To
assess and monitor the quality of RHRW, it is important to
know the most appropriate microorganisms that can be used
to determine appropriate quality of the water. The traditional
testing of water has involved the detection of fecal indicators;
however, one of the signiﬁcant limitations of using fecal indicators to assess the microbial quality of water is their often-poor
correlation with the presence of pathogenic bacteria, protozoas, and viruses. For example, it was reported that E. coli and
enterococci do not correlate well with pathogenic Salmonella
spp. (Lemarchand and Lebaron, 2003), Campylobacter spp.
(Hörman et al., 2004), Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia
spp. (Harwood et al., 2005; Hörman et al., 2004), and enteric
viruses (Griﬃn et al., 1999; Pina et al., 1998) in environmental
waters. There has been little information, however, documenting whether any correlation exists between fecal indicators and
pathogens in rainwater tanks. The two studies that directly
reported on links between pathogens and indicator organisms
had contrasting ﬁndings. Simmons et al. (2001) reported a

positive correlation between Aeromonas spp. and fecal indicators such as total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci. In
contrast, Savill et al. (2001) reported that there was a poor correlation between Campylobacter spp. with total coliforms and
E. coli in tank water. In their study, Campylobacter spp. was
detected in the absence of E. coli on ﬁve occasions and in the
absence of total coliforms on two occasions.
A recent study also reported the limitations of fecal indicator bacteria for the microbial assessment of RHRW quality
(Ahmed et al., 2010). Of the 100 samples tested, up to 83%
samples were positive for fecal indicators as determined by traditional culture-based methods. Additionally, in the samples
tested, 1 to 15% samples were PCR positive for zoonotic bacterial and protozoa pathogens. Discrepancies were observed
in terms of the occurrence of fecal indicators and pathogens.
For example, 12% of samples had <1 CFU E. coli/100 mL
but were positive for one or more pathogens. Similarly 6 and
19% of samples had <1 enterococci and C. perfringens spores,
respectively, but were positive for one or more pathogens. It
was determined that overall, the presence or absence of these
potential pathogens did not correlate well with the detection of
any of the fecal indicators.

Roof-Harvested Rainwater and Associated Health Risks
While most studies relating to RHRW have focused on the
detection of microorganisms in the water, there have also been
eight studies reporting on sporadic gastroenteritis associated
with the consumption of untreated RHRW (Table 3). It should
be noted that RHRW should only be considered a risk from
zoonotic pathogens if there is a distinct source from infected
animals that have access to the roof and that risks do not exist
for human-speciﬁc pathogens (e.g., most viruses). Other issues
that can inﬂuence the level of actual risk include the type and
numbers of pathogen carried by the infected animal, the time
between deposition of fecal matter on the roof and pathogens
being ﬂushed in the rainwater tank, the size of the tank and
form of exposure (e.g., consumption from drinking vs. exposure to droplets in the shower or toilet ﬂushing), and the relative environmental stability of the diﬀerent pathogens.
An example of how all these factors can create a human health
risk is a Salmonella arechevalata-related gastroenteritis outbreak
reported by Koplan et al. (1978) that occurred among 83 campers in Trinidad, West Indies. Epidemiological and bacteriological
studies were performed to identify the source of S. arechevalata
infection. Through patient surveys, food items were ruled out as
the source of the gastroenteritis; however, water samples collected
from two kitchen taps connected to a RHRW system were found
to be positive for S. arechevalata, although the bacterium could

not be directly isolated from the tank. A sanitary survey revealed
that the roof was covered with bird feces, and it was postulated
that rainwater washed oﬀ fecal matter containing S. arechevalata
into the tank, leading to the gastroenteritis outbreak. To test this
hypothesis, a number of intestinal samples were collected from
local birds, rodents, and reptiles that were assumed to be the
source of the contamination. However, S. arechevalata could not
be isolated from the feces of these animals.
Another description of a potential link between pathogens
and RHRW reported on an outbreak of three cases of infant
botulism in New South Wales, Australia, where Clostridium
botulinum type B was isolated from soil around one house
and in the rainwater tank from another house (Murrell and
Stewart, 1983). Clostridium botulinum type A was also present
in soil, dust from a vacuum cleaner, and the rainwater tanks.
The presence of C. botulinum spores in the rainwater tanks was
suggested as possibly contributing to the occurrence of the
infant botulism cases. As a result of this study, consumers with
infant children were advised to disinfect water for the ﬁrst 6
months of the infants lives. Another study reported the isolation of Campylobacter fetus from a 64-yr-old febrile neutropaenic patient, which was subsequently linked to the tank water
(Brodribb et al., 1995). Three sets of blood cultures from the
patient were positive for C. fetus using PCR. The rainwater was
the only source of water supply for this particular household.
To identify the source of infection, a sample of the tank water
was tested and C. fetus was isolated from as little as 200 mL of
water sample. The patient was advised to boil the tank water
before consumption and had no further report of the illness.
Merritt et al. (1999) reported an outbreak of Campylobacter
enteritis among 23 resort staﬀ in Queensland, Australia, with
untreated RHRW. Food was initially suspected as possible
sources of infection. None of the food samples were positive for
the Campylobacter spp., but four rainwater tanks were positive
for total coliforms, with particularly high total coliform numbers
found in one tank. The authors reported a strong association
between gastroenteritis and consumption of water from a dispenser that had probably been ﬁlled from one of the contaminated tanks. It was hypothesized that the Campylobacter spp. that
caused the outbreak may have been introduced into one or more
of the tanks by contamination with the feces of wild animals.
Another reported outbreak of gastroenteritis with a strong link
to contaminated RHRW in Melbourne, Australia, involved an
outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium at a rural school camp
served by a private rainwater supply (Franklin et al., 2009). The
phage type strain DT9 of Salmonella was found in both the fecal
specimens of patients and water taps supplying the untreated
rainwater that were used as a drinking water source, indicating a
direct link between the RHRW and the disease outbreak.
Simmons and Smith (1997) reported the isolation of S.
Typhimurium phage type I from two of four family members
who sought medical attention due to gastrointestinal symptoms. The family lived in a beach-side house and used RHRW
for household use. The family reported that one of their cats,
which spent much time on the roof and frequently defecated
on it, had loose stools for several years. An investigation was
undertaken to identify whether the infection was food borne or
if it originated from the cat feces. However, the infection could
not be related to food or the cat feces. Salmonella Typhimurium
18

phage type I and fecal coliforms were isolated from the houses
tap water, leading the authors to conclude that RHRW was the
possible source of infection, although the original contamination source could not be determined.
An outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in an isolated suburb
of Auckland, New Zealand, was linked to RHRW using PCR,
demonstrating that the isolates of L. pneumophila from patient’s
clinical specimens were identical to the high levels of L. pneumophila present in the nozzle of a local marina water blaster
used to clean boats. Sampling of nearby rainwater collection
systems revealed that contaminated water spray from the water
blaster had been carried and deposited on roof surfaces in the
local area. The L. pneumophila within the spray were washed
into rainwater tank, and users were exposed through bathroom
showers (Simmons et al., 2008).
Since 1978, there have been eight reports of gastroenteritis
associated with the consumption of RHRW cited in the literature (Brodribb et al., 1995; Franklin et al., 2009; Koplan
et al., 1978; Merritt et al., 1999; Murrell and Stewart, 1983;
Schlech et al., 1985; Simmons and Smith, 1997; Simmons et
al., 2008). These studies suggest that the untreated rainwater
may be a contributing factor for gastroenteritis; little is known,
however, regarding the actual health risks from drinking the
rainwater. Several authors highlighted the need for evaluating
the actual health risks from drinking RHRW (Ahmed et al.,
2008; Lye, 1992; Simmons et al., 2001). An epidemiological
study to identify the risk of gastroenteritis among 4- to 6-yrold children who drank RHRW compared with children who
drank treated mains water in South Australia noted that the
consumption of RHRW did not increase an observed level of
gastroenteritis relative to mains water consumption (Heyworth
et al., 2006). The authors concluded, however, that their data
could also have reﬂected a level of acquired immunity among
regular users of RHRW and therefore may not reﬂect the
actual risk to the new users. In New Zealand, numerous cases
of campylobacteriosis have been associated with the rainwater
collection systems (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 1997). A case control study found strong association with gastrointestinal diseases caused by Campylobacter spp. with the consumption of
RHRW. It was hypothesized that the rainwater systems in this
study had been contaminated by birds roosting on the roofs.
In a reported outbreak of 27 cases of Legionnaire’s disease
among tourists visiting the U.S. Virgin Islands, the infections
were thought to have originated from inhalation of L. pneumophila detected in the drinking water system of a local hotel
(Schlech et al., 1985). Case control and microbiological studies
were undertaken to identify the mode of transmission. The exact
mode of transmission during this outbreak could not be determined, but the potable water was implicated as the most probable cause in the absence of other sources. The hotel obtained
its potable water from a RHRW system, and the identical serogroup of the L. pneumophila isolated from the infected patients
was found in the stored RHRW and as well as in hot and cold
water taps. No further cases of Legionellosis were identiﬁed
after the hotel water system was chlorinated. The last of the
reported incidences of RHRW-acquired infections was reported
a case control study in Tasmania, Australia, where single variable associations were found between drinking untreated rainwater and cases of infection with Salmonella mississippi (Ashbolt
Journal of Environmental Quality • Volume 40 • January–February 2011



and Kirk 2006). The highest risk was found to be associated
with exposure to untreated RHRW away from the home of the
participants. These higher risk estimates probably reﬂected a
lower level of immunity in populations not frequently exposed
to this pathogen. Direct contact with native animals known to
be a source of salmonellosis was determined not to be the cause
of infections. The strongest predictor of infection was found to
be the indirect contamination of RHRW systems.
It is probable that incidences of gastrointestinal associated
with RHRW may be underreported. It is highly likely that
only a portion of people with severe gastroenteritis would
seek medical attention, and most fecal specimens that were
collected from patients would not be tested in a hospital. In
Australia, it has been estimated that only between 8 and 11%
of Campylobacter- and Salmonella-related food-borne gastroenteritis cases are reported (Hall et al., 2006). In the United
States, it has been estimated that only 10 to 33% of waterrelated gastroenteritis are reported (Frost et al., 1996). These
statistics suggest that gastroenteritis from sources such as
RHRW would have at least similarly low reporting levels, if
not even lower. Based on the common community belief that
RHRW is of good quality, it should be considered probable
that cases of gastroenteritis would be blamed on other sources
such as food before being blamed on RHRW.
Another limitation is that cases of gastroenteritis due to
drinking untreated rainwater could also actually be masked
by the background levels of gastroenteritis from other sources
such as consumption of food and community-based infections.
The most credible epidemiological study to date reported that
the consumption of RHRW did not increase the risk of gastroenteritis as opposed to mains water (Heyworth et al., 2006).
However, such results should be interpreted with care due to
the lack of sensitivity of the epidemiological tool to detect gastroenteritis (Craun et al., 2004; Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004).
It has been estimated that to detect illness at an annual rate of
100 cases per 10,000 people per year would require samples of
416,000 participants (Eisenberg et al., 2006). Considering the
high costs and time required, therefore, epidemiological studies from sources such as RHRW may not be practical for the
sensitive detection of gastroenteritis in the community.

Management of the Risk of Infections Associated
with Potable and Nonpotable Uses
of Roof-Harvested Rainwater
A recent review paper identiﬁed important parameters for optimum performance of RHRW systems (Lye, 2009). The fecal
contamination of RHRW appears to be limited to improperly
designed systems as well as systems that are not well maintained
and do not undergo any disinfection procedures. It has been suggested that all RHRW systems should be appropriately maintained, including ensuring the cleanliness of the systems before
rainfall events, especially roofs and gutters, which should be
cleaned frequently, while the receiving tanks should be cleaned at
least two times per year to improve the quality of water (Dillaha
and Zolan, 1985). For example, the addition of ﬁrst ﬂush devices
to the systems may reduce the contamination levels in the systems. Another recent study in Sydney, Australia, concluded that
RHRW could provide drinking water quality that complied
Ahmed et al.: Roof-Harvested Rainwater and Health Risks: A Review

with the drinking water guidelines after bypassing the ﬁrst 2 mm
of rainfall using ﬁrst ﬂush devices (Kus et al., 2010).
In addition to the use of appropriate maintenance processes
for rainwater tanks, initial risk assessments can be used to
determine the relative health risks associated with the use of
RHRW for diﬀerent end uses. A few studies have attempted
to identify the inherent risk of infection associated with the
drinking and nonpotable uses of RHRW using Quantitative
Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). A QMRA is a four-step
probabilistic tool for estimating the human health risk associated with deﬁned scenarios from exposure to speciﬁed pathogens (NRC 1983). The four steps are (i) hazard identiﬁcation,
(ii) exposure assessment, (iii) dose–response assessment, and
(iv) risk characterization. One such study was undertaken by
Fewtrell and Kay (2007), who investigated the risk of infection
of Campylobacter from toilet ﬂushing with RHRW in homes
in the United Kingdom. A QMRA estimate was performed
to quantify the risks of Campylobacter infection via ingestion
of aerosols. The outcomes of this QMRA estimate concluded
that any risk from ﬂushing the toilet with harvested rainwater
would be well within the acceptable range.
Another recent study used QMRA analysis to quantify
the risk of infection associated with the exposure to zoonotic pathogens from drinking and nonpotable uses of
RHRW in Queensland, Australia (Ahmed et al., 2009). This
study concluded that the risk of infection from G. lamblia
and Salmonella spp. associated with the use of rainwater for
biweekly garden hosing was below the threshold value of one
extra infection per 10,000 persons per year. However, the
estimated risk of infection from drinking the rainwater daily
was 44 to 250 (for G. lamblia) and 85 to 520 (for Salmonella
spp.) infections per 10,000 persons per year, which is above the
acceptable guideline levels outlined in the Potable Reuse section of the Australian Guidelines for Water Reuse (NRMMC–
EPHC–NHMRC, 2008). Despite this, the overall health risk
appeared to be higher than predicted from reported incidences
of gastroenteritis in the local community where the study was
undertaken. The authors noted that further work is needed
to improve the assumptions needed to be made in the analysis, such as the proportion of gene copies that represent both
viable and infective organisms, since quantitative PCR does
not provide information regarding viability or infectivity and
the occurrence of pathogens. These studies showed that health
risk analyses have their place in aiding the use of RHRW but
are currently restricted by the lack of comprehensive work on
the prevalence of pathogens in RHRW. Improved levels of
available data would enable accurate calculations of the level
of risk and allow an assessment of the required levels of reductions in pathogens numbers for diﬀerent end uses (drinking vs.
nonpotable uses). This can then enable more appropriate treatment measures such as ﬁltration and ultraviolet disinfection
(Daschner et al., 1996; Jordan et al., 2008) can be undertaken
to reduce the risk of infection from RHRW.

Conclusions and Future Directions
The review of the published literature reported here indicates
that the microbial quality of RHRW water may be more highly
variable than is commonly perceived. The published data also
19



suggests that overall, the microbial quality of RHRW should
be considered potentially poor until a more rigorous microbial
assessment can be undertaken. On the basis of the reported data,
it would be anticipated that the quality of RHRW is strongly
inﬂuenced by the season, the number of preceding dry days,
animal activities in close proximity to the roof and rainwater
tanks, geographical location, and other factors (Lye, 2009; Kus
et al., 2010). In addition, little information is currently available on the number of microbial pathogens that can be present
in RHRW. The majority of the studies reported in the literature
assessed the quality of the rainwater on the basis of the presence
or absence of speciﬁc microbial pathogens, with little information available regarding the actual numbers of these pathogens
in RHRW. In addition, no information is available concerning the ongoing prevalence of diﬀerent pathogens in RHRW
over time. It is recommended, therefore, that further research be
undertaken on the occurrence and numbers of potential pathogens in RHRW in a range of locations over time using appropriately designed longitudinal sampling schemes.
In addition, any microbial assessment should involve the
analysis of RHRW for actual pathogenic species, not just the
common fecal indicator bacteria. The available data in the literature have predominantly indicated that the commonly used
indicators such as fecal coliforms and E. coli may not be suitable to indicate the risk of illness from untreated rainwater due
to their observed poor correlation with pathogens (Ahmed et
al., 2010). In addition, several zoonotic bacterial and protozoan
pathogens capable of causing infections in humans have been
detected in individual rainwater systems, probably from wild
birds and animals that have access to roofs (Ahmed et al., 2010;
Simmons et al., 2001), and more testing of RHRW is needed to
quantify the potential impact pathogens originating from animals on health risks from the diﬀerent uses of this water.
Several case control studies established links between gastroenteritis and consumption of untreated RHRW. However,
these reported outbreaks tended to involve small numbers of
individuals, and the reported illnesses were often related to
communal RHRW systems (Brodribb et al., 1995; Franklin
et al., 2009; Murrell and Stewart, 1983). On the other hand,
other studies could not identify RHRW as a source of infection
and therefore could only hypothesize that RHRW was the possible source of infection via circumstantial evidence (Koplan
et al., 1978; Merritt et al., 1999; Simmons and Smith, 1997).
It should be noted that most of these case control studies used
culture-based methods to establish a link between RHRW and
fecal specimens from patients. Additional studies that focus on
the collection and matching of pathogenic strains from fecal
specimens from self-reported incidences of gastroenteritis, and
from potential sources such as tap water and tank water using
sensitive molecular typing methods, would provide valuable
information to determine if there is a direct link between gastroenteritis and RHRW. This could be more practical than a
comparable epidemiological study due to the complexity and
costs of epidemiological studies and the fact that the most
incidences of gastroenteritis remain unreported. The use of a
QMRA health risk analysis using data on the reported incidences of microbial pathogens in RHRW and a series of potential exposure pathways would be another valuable tool to assess
20

overall health risks associated with RHRW and the need for
treatment before certain uses (i.e., drinking).
Finally, it is evident that new or improved guidelines and
policies for RHRW systems are needed to assist maximizing the
uptake and use of RHRW for a range of end uses while ensuring that any associated health risks are minimized through
appropriate management procedures. Proper design and maintenance must be achievable to ensure the long-term success
of RHRW integration in urban water systems. This should
include ongoing monitoring of RHRW systems, health risks
assessments, such as those using QMRA model, and appropriate management requirements to mitigate these risks. This will
only be achieved through the collection of more data on the
incidence and ongoing prevalence of microbial pathogens in
RHRW systems.
