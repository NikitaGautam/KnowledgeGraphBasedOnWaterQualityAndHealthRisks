For relation prediction,  please cite our paper with the above. 

For relation prediction task, we have used TransE, TransH, TransD, DistMult and ComplEx models. Files associated with the experiments done and modified codebase is only included in this folder. 

The detailed information about the experiment, experimental setup, dataset, training and testing can be found in the [OpenKE] (https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch) .
